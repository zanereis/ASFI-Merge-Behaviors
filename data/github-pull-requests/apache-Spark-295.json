What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe RDD repartition also uses the round-robin way to distribute data, this can also cause incorrect answers on RDD workload the similar way as in #20393\r\n\r\nHowever, the approach that fixes DataFrame.repartition() doesn't apply on the RDD repartition issue, because the input data can be non-comparable, as discussed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20393#issuecomment-360912451\r\n\r\nHere, I propose a quick fix that distribute elements use their hashes, this will cause perf regression if you have highly skewed input data, but it will ensure result correctness. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test case in `RDDSuite` to ensure `RDD.repartition()` generate consistent answers.","created_at":"2018-01-27T00:42:30Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T14:08:41Z","closed_at":"2018-09-11T14:08:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d8286195baff5ac55f57ebb1eec8aa6b1c8dc7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20414/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20414/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20414/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6910ed62c272bedfa251cab589bb52bed36be3ed","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:rdd-repartition","ref":"rdd-repartition","sha":"6910ed62c272bedfa251cab589bb52bed36be3ed","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`lastExecution.executedPlan` is lazy val so accessing it in StreamTest may need to acquire the lock of `lastExecution`. It may be waiting forever when the streaming thread is holding it and running a continuous Spark job.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes to check if `s.lastExecution` is null to avoid accessing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nReproducer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\nf = udf(lambda x: x)\r\nspark.range(1).select(f(\"id\"))  # cache JVM UDF instance.\r\nf = f.asNondeterministic()\r\nspark.range(1).select(f(\"id\"))._jdf.logicalPlan().projectList().head().deterministic()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should return `False` but the current master returns `True`. Seems it's because we cache the JVM UDF instance and then we reuse it even after setting `deterministic` disabled once it's called.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. I am not sure if I should add the test with a lot of JVM accesses with the intetnal stuff .. Let me know if anyone feels so. I will add.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR to reflect the stage level blacklisting on the executor tab for the currently active stages.\r\n\r\nAfter this change in the executor tab at the Status column one of the following label will be:\r\n\r\n- \"Blacklisted\" when the executor is blacklisted application level (old flag)\r\n- \"Dead\" when the executor is not Blacklisted and not Active\r\n- \"Blacklisted in Stages: [...]\" when the executor is Active but the there are active blacklisted stages for the executor. Within the [] coma separated active stageIDs are listed.\r\n- \"Active\" when the executor is Active and there is no active blacklisted stages for the executor\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBoth with unit tests and manually.\r\n\r\n#### Manual test\r\n\r\nSpark was started as:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n bin/spark-shell --master \"local-cluster[2,1,1024]\" --conf \"spark.blacklist.enabled=true\" --conf \"spark.blacklist.stage.maxFailedTasksPerExecutor=1\" --conf \"spark.blacklist.application.maxFailedTasksPerExecutor=10\" \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the job was:\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.SparkEnv\r\n\r\nval pairs = sc.parallelize(1 to 10000, 10).map { x =>\r\n  if (SparkEnv.get.executorId.toInt == 0) throw new RuntimeException(\"Bad executor\")\r\n  else  {\r\n    Thread.sleep(10)\r\n    (x % 10, x)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n  \r\nval all = pairs.cogroup(pairs)\r\n  \r\nall.collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nUI screenshots about the running:\r\n\r\n- One executor is blacklisted in the two stages: \r\n\r\n![One executor is blacklisted in two stages](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12908314/multiple_stages_1.png)\r\n\r\n- One stage completes the other one is still running: \r\n\r\n![One stage completes the other is still running](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12908315/multiple_stages_2.png)\r\n\r\n- Both stages are completed: \r\n\r\n![Both stages are completed](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12908316/multiple_stages_3.png)\r\n\r\n### Unit tests\r\n\r\nIn AppStatusListenerSuite.scala both the node blacklisting for a stage and the executor blacklisting for stage are tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn JoinStrategies, currently if no better option is available, it fallbacks to BroadcastNestedLoopJoin. This strategy can be very problematic, since it can cause OOM. While generally this is not a big problem, in some applications like Thriftserver this is an issue, because a failing job can cause the whole application to go in a bad state. Thus, in these cases, it might be useful to be able to disable this behavior and allow to fail only the jobs which can cause it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the current PySpark code, Python created `jsparkSession` doesn't add to JVM's defaultSession, this `SparkSession` object cannot be fetched from Java side, so the below scala code will be failed when loaded in PySpark application.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nclass TestSparkSession extends SparkListener with Logging {\r\n  override def onOtherEvent(event: SparkListenerEvent): Unit = {\r\n    event match {\r\n      case CreateTableEvent(db, table) =>\r\n        val session = SparkSession.getActiveSession.orElse(SparkSession.getDefaultSession)\r\n        assert(session.isDefined)\r\n        val tableInfo = session.get.sharedState.externalCatalog.getTable(db, table)\r\n        logInfo(s\"Table info ${tableInfo}\")\r\n\r\n      case e =>\r\n        logInfo(s\"event $e\")\r\n\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo here propose to add fresh create `jsparkSession` to `defaultSession`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual verification.\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-26T09:46:34Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T12:35:30Z","closed_at":"2018-01-31T11:08:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb634238ce9e61947021881a74ee8c4b00144ad1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20404/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20404/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20404/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cc4b8510c1445fb742c0d750958d352adfa84902","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-23228","ref":"SPARK-23228","sha":"cc4b8510c1445fb742c0d750958d352adfa84902","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIt is a common pattern to apply multiple transforms to a `Dataset` (using `Dataset.withColumn` for example. This is currently quite expensive because we run `CheckAnalysis` on the full plan and create an encoder for each intermediate `Dataset`.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the usage of the `AnalysisBarrier` to include `CheckAnalysis`. By doing this we hide the already analyzed plan  from `CheckAnalysis` because barrier is a `LeafNode`. The `AnalysisBarrier` is in the `FinishAnalysis` phase of the optimizer.\r\n\r\nWe also make binding the `Dataset` encoder lazy. The bound encoder is only needed when we materialize the dataset.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test should cover this.","created_at":"2018-01-26T03:41:10Z","updated_at":"2018-01-29T17:03:47Z","closed_at":"2018-01-29T17:03:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67accb16dc676eb78f4e0bd78d237ca09ffe28ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d0cfbd0b1975f0b35537eb2c573fe758048319f7","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-23223","ref":"SPARK-23223","sha":"d0cfbd0b1975f0b35537eb2c573fe758048319f7","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ColumnVector` is very flexible about how to implement array type. As a result `ColumnVector` has 3 abstract methods for array type: `arrayData`, `getArrayOffset`, `getArrayLength`. For example, in `WritableColumnVector` we use the first child vector as the array data vector, and store offsets and lengths in 2 arrays in the parent vector. `ArrowColumnVector` has a different implementation.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies `ColumnVector` by using only one abstract method for array type: `getArray`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests.\r\n\r\nrerun `ColumnarBatchBenchmark`, there is no performance regression.","created_at":"2018-01-25T14:38:17Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T23:52:38Z","closed_at":"2018-01-26T17:20:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"72325f622032a020c06fee8989e7eba83590ca10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/957d040a47c5a60bdbb19d0490dc748f66680376","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:vector","ref":"vector","sha":"957d040a47c5a60bdbb19d0490dc748f66680376","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently shuffle repartition uses RoundRobinPartitioning, the generated result is nondeterministic since the sequence of input rows are not determined.\r\n\r\nThe bug can be triggered when there is a repartition call following a shuffle (which would lead to non-deterministic row ordering), as the pattern shows below:\r\nupstream stage -> repartition stage -> result stage\r\n(-> indicate a shuffle)\r\nWhen one of the executors process goes down, some tasks on the repartition stage will be retried and generate inconsistent ordering, and some tasks of the result stage will be retried generating different data.\r\n\r\nThe following code returns 931532, instead of 1000000:\r\n```\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\nval res = spark.range(0, 1000 * 1000, 1).repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n  x\r\n}.repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n  if (TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0 && TaskContext.get.partitionId < 2) {\r\n    throw new Exception(\"pkill -f java\".!!)\r\n  }\r\n  x\r\n}\r\nres.distinct().count()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we propose a most straight-forward way to fix this problem by performing a local sort before partitioning, after we make the input row ordering deterministic, the function from rows to partitions is fully deterministic too.\r\n\r\nThe downside of the approach is that with extra local sort inserted, the performance of repartition() will go down, so we add a new config named `spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition` to control whether this patch is applied. The patch is default enabled to be safe-by-default, but user may choose to manually turn it off to avoid performance regression.\r\n\r\nThis patch also changes the output rows ordering of repartition(), that leads to a bunch of test cases failure because they are comparing the results directly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd unit test in ExchangeSuite.\r\n\r\nWith this patch(and `spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition` set to true), the following query returns 1000000:\r\n```\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition\", \"true\")\r\n\r\nval res = spark.range(0, 1000 * 1000, 1).repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n  x\r\n}.repartition(200).map { x =>\r\n  if (TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0 && TaskContext.get.partitionId < 2) {\r\n    throw new Exception(\"pkill -f java\".!!)\r\n  }\r\n  x\r\n}\r\nres.distinct().count()\r\n\r\nres7: Long = 1000000\r\n```","created_at":"2018-01-25T09:03:24Z","updated_at":"2019-08-06T00:57:44Z","closed_at":"2018-01-26T23:03:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83cfad0d3bd0ad6786aa1eaf7c3a209283dff4a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20393/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20393/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20393/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/400a7668a86a7bb48110808a2472d5d072018138","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:shuffle-repartition","ref":"shuffle-repartition","sha":"400a7668a86a7bb48110808a2472d5d072018138","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

time is the charm?\r\n\r\nThere was still a race that was left in previous attempts. If the handle\r\ncloses the connection, the close() implementation would clean up state\r\nthat would prevent the thread from waiting on the connection thread to\r\nfinish. That could cause the race causing the test flakiness reported\r\nin the bug.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to move the \"wait for connection thread\" code to a separate\r\nclose method that is used by the handle; that also simplifies the code\r\na bit and makes it also easier to follow.\r\n\r\nI included an unrelated, but correct, change to a YARN test so that\r\nit triggers when the PR is built.\r\n\r\nTested by inserting a sleep in the connection thread to mimic the race;\r\ntest failed reliably with the sleep, passes now. (Sleep not included in\r\nthe patch.) Also ran YARN tests to make sure.","created_at":"2018-01-24T22:14:32Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T18:47:31Z","closed_at":"2018-01-26T04:01:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7893f527c516b83a56183d6394546086e1dcf04f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/358caffc4f0e57aa8935f523f285a5ebf6621c37","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-23020","ref":"SPARK-23020","sha":"358caffc4f0e57aa8935f523f285a5ebf6621c37","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-23203: DataSourceV2 should use immutable catalyst trees instead of wrapping a mutable DataSourceV2Reader. This commit updates DataSourceV2Relation and consolidates much of the DataSourceV2 API requirements for the read path in it. Instead of wrapping a reader that changes, the relation lazily produces a reader from its configuration.\r\n\r\nThis commit also updates the predicate and projection push-down. Instead of the implementation from SPARK-22197, this reuses the rule matching from the Hive and DataSource read paths (using `PhysicalOperation`) and copies most of the implementation of `SparkPlanner.pruneFilterProject`, with updates for DataSourceV2. By reusing the implementation from other read paths, this should have fewer regressions from other read paths and is less code to maintain.\r\n\r\nThe new push-down rules also supports the following edge cases:\r\n\r\n* The output of DataSourceV2Relation should be what is returned by the reader, in case the reader can only partially satisfy the requested schema projection\r\n* The requested projection passed to the DataSourceV2Reader should include filter columns\r\n* The push-down rule may be run more than once if filters are not pushed through projections\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting push-down and read tests.","created_at":"2018-01-24T19:00:19Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T16:49:28Z","closed_at":"2018-02-20T08:07:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2569c5cf67961932892d7f0cdf4d40e37de1cdb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a603dbe5528b447bff371d2e00abdbdee664a75","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-22386-push-down-immutable-trees","ref":"SPARK-22386-push-down-immutable-trees","sha":"1a603dbe5528b447bff371d2e00abdbdee664a75","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

PR is deprecated.\r\nSee #20454\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the api `DataSourceV2Writer#commit(WriterCommitMessage[])` commits a \r\n\r\nwriting job with a list of commit messages.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense in some scenarios, e.g. MicroBatchExecution.\r\n\r\nHowever, the API makes it hard to implement `onTaskCommit(taskCommit: TaskCommitMessage)` in `FileCommitProtocol`.\r\nIn general, on receiving commit message, driver can start processing messages(e.g. persist messages into files) before all the messages are collected.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to break down `DataSourceV2Writer.commit` into two phase:\r\n\r\n1. `add(WriterCommitMessage message)`: Handles a commit message produced by`DataWriter#commit()`.\r\n2. `commit()`:  Commits the writing job.\r\n\r\nThis should make the API compatible with `FileCommitProtocol`, and more flexible.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-24T17:27:03Z","updated_at":"2018-02-02T15:36:41Z","closed_at":"2018-02-02T15:36:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4aedaddb367ccfed55b9bfc76177b046d0500754","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20386/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20386/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20386/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/540ff0631471a27af23abb7e8c034bad1ba27cbc","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:DSV2_Writer","ref":"DSV2_Writer","sha":"540ff0631471a27af23abb7e8c034bad1ba27cbc","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

Atallah Hezbor <atallahhezbor@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes modifying the match statement that gets the columns of a row in HiveThriftServer. There was previously no case for `UserDefinedType`, so querying a table that contained them would throw a match error. The changes catch that case and return the string representation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWhile I would have liked to add a unit test, I couldn't easily incorporate UDTs into the ``HiveThriftServer2Suites`` pipeline. With some guidance I would be happy to push a commit with tests.\r\n\r\nInstead I did a manual test by loading a `DataFrame` with Point UDT in a spark shell with a HiveThriftServer. Then in beeline, connecting to the server and querying that table. \r\n\r\nHere is the result before the change\r\n```\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> select * from chicago;\r\nError: scala.MatchError: org.apache.spark.sql.PointUDT@2d980dc3 (of class org.apache.spark.sql.PointUDT) (state=,code=0)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd after the change:\r\n```\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using the Kubernetes cluster-manager and spawning a Streaming workload, it is important to reset many spark.kubernetes.* properties that are generated by spark-submit but which would get rewritten when restoring a Checkpoint. This is so, because the spark-submit codepath creates Kubernetes resources, such as a ConfigMap, a Secret and other variables, which have an autogenerated name and the previous one will not resolve anymore.\r\n\r\nIn short, this change enables checkpoint restoration for streaming workloads, and thus enables Spark Streaming workloads in Kubernetes, which were not possible to restore from a checkpoint before if the workload went down.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested with the twitter-streaming example in AWS, using checkpoints in s3 with the s3a:// protocol, as supported by Hadoop.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the YARN related code for resetting a Spark Streaming workload, but for the Kubernetes scheduler. I'm adding the initcontainers properties because even if the discussion is not completely settled on the mailing list, my understanding is that at this moment they are going forward for the moment.\r\n\r\nFor a previous discussion, see the non-rebased work at:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange DataSourceScanExec so that when grouping blocks together into partitions, also checks the end of the sorted list of splits to more efficiently fill out partitions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated old test to reflect the new logic, which causes the # of partitions to drop from 4 -> 3\r\nAlso, a current test exists to test large non-splittable files at https://github.com/glentakahashi/spark/blob/c575977a5952bf50b605be8079c9be1e30f3bd36/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/FileSourceStrategySuite.scala#L346\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThe current bin-packing method of next-fit descending for blocks into partitions is sub-optimal in a lot of cases and will result in extra partitions, un-even distribution of block-counts across partitions, and un-even distribution of partition sizes.\r\n\r\nAs an example, 128 files ranging from 1MB, 2MB,...127MB,128MB. will result in 82 partitions with the current algorithm, but only 64 using this algorithm. Also in this example, the max # of blocks per partition in NFD is 13, while in this algorithm is is 2.\r\n\r\nMore generally, running a simulation of 1000 runs using 128MB blocksize, between 1-1000 normally distributed file sizes between 1-500Mb, you can see an improvement of approx 5% reduction of partition counts, and a large reduction in standard deviation of blocks per partition.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm also runs in O(n) time as NFD does, and in every case is strictly better results than NFD.\r\n\r\nOverall, the more even distribution of blocks across partitions and therefore reduced partition counts should result in a small but significant performance increase across the board\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-23T23:24:52Z","updated_at":"2018-02-15T02:38:19Z","closed_at":"2018-01-31T17:17:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e08d9598cfa6feea5c366129d97535cb078e6c84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20372/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20372/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20372/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/57722cfaa035dc63da21c6bd442d995b8a0bcf0a","head":{"label":"glentakahashi:feature/improved-block-merging","ref":"feature/improved-block-merging","sha":"57722cfaa035dc63da21c6bd442d995b8a0bcf0a","user":{"login":"glentakahashi","id":1022767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1022767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi","html_url":"https://github.com/glentakahashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":91184524,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MTE4NDUyNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"glentakahashi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"glentakahashi","id":1022767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1022767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi","html_url":"https://github.com/glentakahashi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glentakahashi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/glentakahashi/spark","description":"Palantir

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the CountVectorizer has a minDF parameter.\r\n\r\nIt might be useful to also have a maxDF parameter.\r\nIt will be used as a threshold for filtering all the terms that occur very frequently in a text corpus, because they are not very informative or could even be stop-words.\r\n\r\nThis is analogous to scikit-learn, CountVectorizer, max_df.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Refactored code to invoke \"filter()\" conditioned on maxDF or minDF set.\r\n- Refactored code to unpersist input after counting is done.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-23T19:15:18Z","updated_at":"2018-01-28T16:30:59Z","closed_at":"2018-01-28T16:30:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4be7c96539de5d2980e04563dfa103c3c64df80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20367/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20367/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20367/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c62d9a51ae885204e76fc6997952aaddb5aeb64e","head":{"label":"ymazari:SPARK-23166","ref":"SPARK-23166","sha":"c62d9a51ae885204e76fc6997952aaddb5aeb64e","user":{"login":"ymazari","id":1829525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mjk1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1829525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari","html_url":"https://github.com/ymazari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":118300119,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTgzMDAxMTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"ymazari/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ymazari","id":1829525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mjk1MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1829525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari","html_url":"https://github.com/ymazari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ymazari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ymazari/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSQL ANSI 2011 states that in case of overflow during arithmetic operations, an exception should be thrown. This is what most of the SQL DBs do (eg. SQLServer, DB2). Hive currently returns NULL (as Spark does) but HIVE-18291 is open to be SQL compliant.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduce an option to decide which behavior Spark should follow, ie. returning NULL on overflow or throwing an exception.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

So, the current master cannot reorder joins in a query below;\r\n```\r\nval df1 = spark.range(100).selectExpr(\"id % 10 AS k0\", s\"id % 10 AS k1\", s\"id % 10 AS k2\", \"id AS v1\")\r\nval df2 = spark.range(10).selectExpr(\"id AS k0\", \"id AS v2\")\r\nval df3 = spark.range(10).selectExpr(\"id AS k1\", \"id AS v3\")\r\nval df4 = spark.range(10).selectExpr(\"id AS k2\", \"id AS v4\")\r\ndf1.join(df2, \"k0\").join(df3, \"k1\").join(df4, \"k2\").explain(true)\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nk2: bigint, k1: bigint, k0: bigint, v1: bigint, v2: bigint, v3: bigint, v4: bigint\r\nProject [k2#5L, k1#4L, k0#3L, v1#6L, v2#16L, v3#24L, v4#32L]\r\n+- Join Inner, (k2#5L = k2#31L)\r\n   :- Project [k1#4L, k0#3L, k2#5L, v1#6L, v2#16L, v3#24L]\r\n   :  +- Join Inner, (k1#4L = k1#23L)\r\n   :     :- Project [k0#3L, k1#4L, k2#5L, v1#6L, v2#16L]\r\n   :     :  +- Join Inner, (k0#3L = k0#15L)\r\n   :     :     :- Project [(id#0L % cast(10 as bigint)) AS k0#3L, (id#0L % cast(10 as bigint)) AS k1#4L, (id#0L % cast(10 as bigint)) AS k2#5L, id#0\r\nL AS v1#6L]\r\n   :     :     :  +- Range (0, 100, step=1, splits=Some(4))\r\n   :     :     +- Project [id#12L AS k0#15L, id#12L AS v2#16L]\r\n   :     :        +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=Some(4))\r\n   :     +- Project [id#20L AS k1#23L, id#20L AS v3#24L]\r\n   :        +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=Some(4))\r\n   +- Project [id#28L AS k2#31L, id#28L AS v4#32L]\r\n      +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=Some(4))\r\n```\r\nTo reorder the query, this pr added code to handle `Project` in `ExtractFiltersAndInnerJoins`.\r\n\r\nThis pr also fixed an output attribute reorder problem when joins reordered; it checks if a join reordered plan and an original plan have the same output attribute order with each other. If not, `ReorderJoin` adds `Project` in the top of the join reordered plan.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis pr added new tests in `JoinOptimizationSuite` and modified some existing tests in `StarJoinReorderSuite` to check if `ReorderJoin` can handle `Project` nodes correctly. Also, it modified the existing tests in `JoinReorderSuite` for the output attribute reorder issue.","created_at":"2018-01-21T18:52:21Z","updated_at":"2020-05-01T02:12:32Z","closed_at":"2020-05-01T02:12:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f329d47aceaeb24eca709071babfe0ea5e38791e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20345/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20345/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20345/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/37e5fe284d6d35eda7d61ba01bf43bcba8af844d","head":{"label":"maropu:FixFlattenJoins","ref":"FixFlattenJoins","sha":"37e5fe284d6d35eda7d61ba01bf43bcba8af844d","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr added TPCDS v2.7 (latest) queries in `TPCDSQuerySuite` because the current `TPCDSQuerySuite` tests older one (v1.4) and some queries are different from v1.4 and v2.7. Since the original v2.7 queries have the syntaxes that Spark cannot parse, I changed these queries in a following way:\r\n\r\n - [date] + 14 days -> date + `INTERVAL` 14 days\r\n - [column name] as \"30 days\" -> [column name] as \\`30 days\\`\r\n - Fix some syntax errors, e.g., missing brackets\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `TPCDSQuerySuite`.","created_at":"2018-01-21T15:55:48Z","updated_at":"2018-03-25T16:22:26Z","closed_at":"2018-03-25T16:22:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c42621a7df19ed27ba1aa1a3a11252c80febbee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20343/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20343/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20343/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d04b0872bcc02b5eadd309c560cda77ff1b8da0a","head":{"label":"maropu:TPCDSV2_7","ref":"TPCDSV2_7","sha":"d04b0872bcc02b5eadd309c560cda77ff1b8da0a","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe allJobs and the job pages attempt to use stage attempt and DAG visualization from the store, but for long running jobs they are not guaranteed to be retained, leading to exceptions when these pages are rendered.\r\n\r\nTo fix it `store.lastStageAttempt(stageId)` and `store.operationGraphForJob(jobId)` are wrapped in `store.asOption` and default values are used if the info is missing.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing of the UI, also using the test command reported in
