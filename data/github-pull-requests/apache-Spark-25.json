What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis bug covers improving an error message in the event of invalid UDTF calls. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect * from udtf(\r\n  observed => TABLE(select column from t),\r\n  value_col => classic_dollars\r\n)\r\n```\r\nCurrently we get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnsupported subquery expression: Table arguments are used in a function where they are not supported:\r\n'UnresolvedTableValuedFunction [udtf], [observed => table-argument#68918 [], value_col => 'classic_dollars, false\r\n   +- Project ...\r\n       +- SubqueryAlias ...\r\n          +- Relation ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the real error is that the user passed column identifier classic_dollars rather than string \"classic_dollars\" into the string argument.\r\n\r\nThe core reason is that `CheckAnalysis` checks the analyzer output tree for unresolved TABLE arguments first before checking for remaining unresolved attribute references.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, we update `CheckAnalysis` to move the check for remaining `TABLE` arguments to later. Now that query returns something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"errorClass\" : \"UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITHOUT_SUGGESTION\",\r\n  \"sqlState\" : \"42703\",\r\n  \"messageParameters\" : {\r\n    \"objectName\" : \"`classic_dollars`\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"queryContext\" : [ {\r\n    \"objectType\" : \"\",\r\n    \"objectName\" : \"\",\r\n    \"startIndex\" : 93,\r\n    \"stopIndex\" : 109,\r\n    \"fragment\" : \"classic_dollars\"\r\n  } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis improves error messages for SQL queries that are invalid, but that a user might reasonably create accidentally while figuring out how the syntax works for calling table-valued functions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds and updates golden file test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nJust some casual, everyday GitHub CoPilot

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd new interface (`ExternallyPlannedV1Scan`) for `V1Scan` which will prevent `DataSourceV2Strategy` to do planning of optimized scan node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSometimes, we want to extend Spark with new strategies (it can be done by adding strategy to `extraStrategies` property of `SparkSession`), and we want that strategy to plan `DataSourceV2ScanRelation` node. Even extra strategies are applied before other strategies (and have extra priority), often those strategies tries to do some push downs (or optimization) with `Filter` and `Project` logical plans. If that push down fails, then `DataSourceV2Strategy` will do planning, because it can handle Filter/Project for every expression. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo tests made, existing tests covers we did not make regression for current planning logic.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-22T12:43:56Z","updated_at":"2024-07-23T14:05:29Z","closed_at":"2024-07-23T14:05:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35e60f16244ae33974ff8632ec7f5829ce5fe3c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47443/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47443/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47443/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f7673aa289cf23b4604289d1c7138667d52e86be","head":{"label":"urosstan-db:SPARK-48925-Add-interface-which-prohibit-scan-planning-using-data-source-v2-strategy","ref":"SPARK-48925-Add-interface-which-prohibit-scan-planning-using-data-source-v2-strategy","sha":"f7673aa289cf23b4604289d1c7138667d52e86be","user":{"login":"urosstan-db","id":155642965,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUbsVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155642965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db","html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":750788282,"node_id":"R_kgDOLMAeug","name":"spark","full_name":"urosstan-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"urosstan-db","id":155642965,"node_id":"U_kgDOCUbsVQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/155642965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db","html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosstan-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/urosstan-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes introduction of IF/ELSE statement to SQL scripting language.\r\nTo evaluate conditions in IF or ELSE IF clauses, introduction of boolean statement evaluator is required as well.\r\n\r\nChanges summary:\r\n- Grammar/parser changes:\r\n  - `ifElseStatement` grammar rule\r\n  - `visitIfElseStatement` rule visitor\r\n  - `IfElseStatement` logical operator\r\n- `IfElseStatementExec` execution node:\r\n  - Internal states - `Condition` and `Body`\r\n  - Iterator implementation - iterate over conditions until the one that evaluates to `true` is found\r\n  - Use `StatementBooleanEvaluator` implementation to evaluate conditions\r\n- `DataFrameEvaluator`:\r\n  - Implementation of `StatementBooleanEvaluator`\r\n  - Evaluates results to `true` if it is single row, single column of boolean type with value `true`\r\n- `SqlScriptingInterpreter` - add logic to transform `IfElseStatement` to `IfElseStatementExec`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are gradually introducing SQL Scripting to Spark, and IF/ELSE is one of the basic control flow constructs in the SQL language. For more details, check [JIRA item](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48346).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests are introduced to all of the three scripting test suites: `SqlScriptingParserSuite`, `SqlScriptingExecutionNodeSuite` and `SqlScriptingInterpreterSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-22T12:09:25Z","updated_at":"2024-08-07T17:37:16Z","closed_at":"2024-08-05T07:32:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c39d1e3c9c9ab3fe32fdce265046752847fcb369","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47442/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47442/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47442/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/014a915d2aebab3c8eeff9df1a0ba8ab8460a746","head":{"label":"davidm-db:sql_scripting_if_else","ref":"sql_scripting_if_else","sha":"014a915d2aebab3c8eeff9df1a0ba8ab8460a746","user":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":775065390,"node_id":"R_kgDOLjKPLg","name":"spark","full_name":"davidm-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**Issue:**\r\nIn the Spark versions post v3.0.2, the SUCCESS Marker file is missing on the root path when spark write is successful with dynamic partition write mode. \r\n\r\n* This issue happens specifically when partitionOverwriteMode = dynamic (Insert Overwrite - [SPARK-20236](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20236)).\r\n\r\n* \"_SUCCESS\" file is created for spark version <= 3.0.2, given: \"spark.hadoop.mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.marksuccessfuljobs\"=”true”.\r\n\r\n* \"_SUCCESS\" file is not created for spark version > 3.0.2 even when \"spark.hadoop.mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.marksuccessfuljobs\"=”true”.\r\n\r\n**Analysis (RCA):**\r\n\r\n* What changed: After the change for [SPARK-29302](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29302) (dynamic partition overwrite with speculation enabled) got merged, the SUCCESS marker file stopped getting created at the root location when the Spark job writes in dynamic partition override mode.\r\n* The change [SPARK-29302](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29302) (dynamic partition overwrite with speculation enabled) sets the committerOutputPath=${stagingDir} which previously stored root dir path, in [this codeblock](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29000/files#diff-15b529afe19e971b138fc604909bcab2e42484babdcea937f41d18cb22d9401dR167-R175).\r\n* The committerOutputPath parameter is passed on to the hadoop committer, which creates the SUCCESS marker file at the path specified in committerOutputPath parameter. Thus, the SUCESS marker is now created inside the stagingDir.\r\n* Once Hadoop committer has finished writing, The Spark Commit Protocol logic copies all the data files to root path, [but NOT the SUCCESS marker] before deleting the ${stagingDir}.  \r\n* The stagingDir is then deleted along with SUCCESS Marker file.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Fix:**\r\n\r\nAdd a step to copy _SUCCESS file as well to the final location before deleting the stagingDir [HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/io/HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol.scala#L239).\r\n\r\n```\r\n    // create the _SUCCESS file at the final location if created in staging\r\n      val stagingSuccessPath = new Path(stagingDir, \"_SUCCESS\")\r\n      if (fs.exists(stagingSuccessPath)) {\r\n        val finalSuccessPath = new Path(path, \"_SUCCESS\")\r\n        // create the _SUCCESS file at the final location, overwrite true\r\n        fs.create(finalSuccessPath, true).close()\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUnavailability of this success marker file can be problematic for certain kind of bigdata pipelines which depend on the marker file for their workflow.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make the parameter naming of `PySparkException` consistent with JVM\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe parameter names of `PySparkException` are different from `SparkException` so there is an inconsistency when searching those parameters from error logs.\r\n\r\nSparkException:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6508b1f5e18731359354af0a7bcc1382bc4f356b/common/utils/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkException.scala#L27-L33\r\n\r\nPySparkException:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6508b1f5e18731359354af0a7bcc1382bc4f356b/python/pyspark/errors/exceptions/base.py#L29-L40\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add the support of `--remote` at `bin/spark-submit` so it can use Spark Connect easily. This PR inclues:\r\n- Make `bin/spark-submit` working with Scala Spark Connect client\r\n- Pass `--conf` and loaded configurations to both Scala and Python Spark Connect clients\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`bin/pyspark --remote` already works. We should also make `bin/spark-submit` works in order for end users to try Spark Connect out and to have the consistent way.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes,\r\n- `bin/spark-submit` supports `--remote` option in Scala.\r\n- `bin/spark-submit` supports `--conf` and loaded Spark configurations to pass to the clients in Scala and Python\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPython:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\necho \"from pyspark.sql import SparkSession;spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate();assert 'connect' in str(type(spark));assert spark.range(1).first()[0] == 0\" > test.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/spark-submit --name \"testApp\" --remote \"local\" test.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nScala:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark-connect-example\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark-connect-example\r\ncd

VALUES` by eagerly evaluating the parse subtree that is generated for such statements into a `LocalTable`. Instead of waiting until the analyzer stage to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently very large \"INSERT INTO ... VALUES\" statements result into disproportionally large parse trees as each parsed literal will need to remain in the parse tree, until it eventually gets evaluated into a `LocalTable`, which takes place when analyzer/optimizer rules are applied.\r\n\r\nThis results in increased memory pressure on the driver, when multiple such large statements are executed in parallel, that can lead to OOMs and GC pauses. It also results in suboptimal runtime performance as the time it takes to apply analyzer/optimizer rules is typically proportional to the size of the parse tree.\r\n\r\nBoth these issues can be resolved by applying the functions that evaluate the unresolved table into a local table eagerly from the AST Builder, thus short-circuiting the evaluation of such statements.\r\n\r\n#### Runtime & Memory Benchmarks\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this benchmark we generated a table (we are attaching the create statement later in this section), and we captured both the execution time and the memory footprint of the driver when executing an `INSERT INTO ... VALUES` statement of increasing size, both with and without this PR.\r\n\r\n**Runtime Comparison**\r\nThe table below shows the runtime difference between various sizes of insert statements:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNumber of tuples      AVG time WITH this change (seconds)   AVG time WITHOUT this change (seconds)      speedup\r\n500k                           40.27                            48.26                                   20%\r\n1M                             79.80                            95.88                                   20%\r\n1.5m                           122.11                           145.42                                  19%\r\n3m                             232.37                           283.71                                  22%\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this was ran on fairly high spec machine, so these numbers should be much more substantial on more average-spec'd machines.\r\n\r\n**Memory Comparison**\r\nThe memory footprint was captured by generating a heap dump right after the generation of the parse tree. In the heap dumps below we notice that the footprint of the `InsertIntoStatement` for:\r\n* 1M tuples was reduced from roughly ~4.6 GB to roughly 888MB (~81% improvement).\r\n* 3M tuples was reduced from roughly ~19.4 GB to roughly ~3.14 GB (~83% improvement).\r\n\r\nThe attached heap dumps also illustrate that the child node of the `InsertIntoStatement` has successfully been replaced by a `LocalTable`.\r\n\r\n**Heap dumps while inserting 1M tuples**\r\nBefore this fix:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c76ace7c-699a-4e32-bb28-4a89f7ce1e0f)\r\n\r\nAfter this

 ### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduce runtime partition filtering for SPJ.  In planning, we have the list of partition values on both sides to plan the tasks.  We can thus filter out partition values based on the join type.\r\n\r\nCurrently LEFT OUTER, RIGHT OUTER, INNER join types are supported as they are more common, we can optimize other join types in subsequent PR.\r\n\r\n  ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn some common join types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT), we have an opportunity to greatly reduce the data scanned in SPJ.  For example, a small table joining a larger table by partition key, can prune out most of the partitions of the large table.\r\n\r\nThere is some similarity with the concept of DPP, but that uses heuristics and this is more exact as SPJ planning requires us anyway to list out both sides partitioning.\r\n\r\n  ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n  ### How was

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe builtin ProtoBuf connector first supports recursive schema reference. It is approached by letting users specify an option “recursive.fields.max.depth”, and at the start of the execution, unroll the recursive field by this level. It converts a problem of dynamic schema for each row to a fixed schema which is supported by Spark. Avro can just adopt a similar method. This PR defines an option \"recursiveFieldMaxDepth\" to both Avro data source and `from_avro` function. With this option, Spark can support Avro recursive schema up to certain depth.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRecursive reference denotes the case that the type of a field can be defined before in the parent nodes. A simple example is:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"record\",\r\n  \"name\": \"LongList\",\r\n  \"fields\" : [\r\n    {\"name\": \"value\", \"type\": \"long\"},\r\n    {\"name\": \"next\", \"type\": [\"null\", \"LongList\"]}\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is written in Avro Schema DSL and represents a linked list data structure. Spark currently will throw an error on this schema. Many users used schema like this, so we should support it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Previously, it will throw error on recursive schemas like above. With this change, it will still throw the same error by default but when users specify the option to a number greater than 0, the schema will be unrolled to that depth.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new unit tests and integration tests to AvroSuite and AvroFunctionSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse `HashSet`/`HashMap` instead of doing linear searches over the `Seq`. In case of 1000s of partitions this significantly improves the performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo avoid the O(n*m) passes in the `PreprocessTableCreation`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting UTs\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request introduces the logic of error handling inside SQL Scripting language. Now, it is possible to:\r\n- declare conditions for specific SQL States\r\n- declare handlers to catch and process errors that are risen during statement execution\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe intent is to add the possibility for user to handle SQL errors in a custom defined way..\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere are already existing test suites for SQL scripting that have been improved to test new functionalities:\r\n\r\n- `SqlScriptingParserSuite`\r\n- `SqlScriptingExecutionNodeSuite`\r\n- `SqlScriptingInterpreterSuite`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n#### Additional changes:\r\nAdded `cleanup` method inside `CompoundBody` to handle premature exit. Currently this can happen while executing `leave` statement.\r\n\r\nNEED TO FIX (follow-up work):\r\n\r\n- No checks for recursion (direct or indirect) we will probably skip this for now.\r\n- If the handler itself raises a condition, it cannot handle that condition, nor can any other handlers declared in the block.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-19T12:25:52Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T00:26:30Z","closed_at":"2024-12-11T00:26:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47423/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47423/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47423/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/97c0f5c9f4d1219bd990e37dcab34e6d94eba37d","head":{"label":"miland-db:sql_batch_handler_in_interator","ref":"sql_batch_handler_in_interator","sha":"97c0f5c9f4d1219bd990e37dcab34e6d94eba37d","user":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768539955,"node_id":"R_kgDOLc79Mw","name":"spark","full_name":"miland-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to introduce `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE ...` SQL syntax to `get variables`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- currently, regarding `VARIABLE`, we support the following syntax:\r\n```\r\nDECLARE (OR REPLACE)? VARIABLE ...\r\nDROP TEMPORARY VARIABLE (IF EXISTS)? ...\r\nSET (VARIABLE | VAR) ...\r\n```\r\nBut we are unable to obtain the current status of `VARIABLE`\r\n\r\n- other databases have similar syntax, eg:\r\n  snowflake: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-variables\r\n  <img width=\"805\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c2fd7fe-6f38-4376-902b-d3eebb81d250\">\r\n\r\n  Mysql: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/show-variables.html\r\n  oracle: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-5.7-en/show-variables.html\r\n  teradata: https://docs.teradata.com/r/Enterprise_IntelliFlex_VMware/Database-Utilities/Control-GDO-Editor-ctl/Ctl-Commands/PRINT-variable\r\n\r\n- so I propose introducing syntax `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE ...` that can retrieve all variables in the spark system.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-19T11:48:57Z","updated_at":"2024-12-02T07:00:06Z","closed_at":"2024-11-29T11:18:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f7dbc2023f38c52cb781afa1cff30dca89dc9de0","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-48948","ref":"SPARK-48948","sha":"f7dbc2023f38c52cb781afa1cff30dca89dc9de0","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSince charset names can be non-literal values, they might be case inconsistent. In this pull request, we are converting the charset name to lowercase before calling Charset.forName. This allows values like 'ISO-8859-1' and 'Iso-8859-1' to hit the 2-level cached Charset. By using lowercase instead of uppercase charset names, we align the way `Charset.forName` does further lookup after cache missing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nperformance improvement\r\n\r\n- L1 lookup\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private static Charset lookup(String charsetName) {\r\n        if (charsetName == null)\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Null charset name\");\r\n        Object[] a;\r\n        if ((a = cache1) != null && charsetName.equals(a[0]))\r\n            return (Charset)a[1];\r\n        // We expect most programs to use one Charset repeatedly.\r\n        // We convey a hint to this effect to the VM by putting the\r\n        // level 1 cache miss code in a separate method.\r\n        return lookup2(charsetName);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- L2 lookup\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   private static Charset lookup2(String charsetName) {\r\n        Object[] a;\r\n        if ((a = cache2) != null && charsetName.equals(a[0])) {\r\n            cache2 = cache1;\r\n            cache1 = a;\r\n            return (Charset)a[1];\r\n        }\r\n        Charset cs;\r\n        if ((cs = standardProvider.charsetForName(charsetName)) != null ||\r\n            (cs = lookupExtendedCharset(charsetName))           != null ||\r\n            (cs = lookupViaProviders(charsetName))              != null)\r\n        {\r\n            cache(charsetName, cs);\r\n            return cs;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        /* Only need to check the name if we didn't find a charset for it */\r\n        checkName(charsetName);\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n- After missing\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private Map<String,Charset> cache() {\r\n        Map<String,Charset> map = cache;\r\n        if (map == null) {\r\n            map = new Cache();\r\n            map.put(\"utf-8\", UTF_8.INSTANCE);\r\n            map.put(\"iso-8859-1\", ISO_8859_1.INSTANCE);\r\n            map.put(\"us-ascii\", US_ASCII.INSTANCE);\r\n            map.put(\"utf-16\", java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_16);\r\n            map.put(\"utf-16be\", java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_16BE);\r\n            map.put(\"utf-16le\", java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_16LE);\r\n            cache = map;\r\n        }\r\n        return map;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe got a customer issue that a `MergeInto` query on Iceberg table works earlier but cannot work after upgrading to Spark 3.4.\r\n\r\nThe error looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkRuntimeException: Error while decoding: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedException: Invalid call to nullable on unresolved object\r\nupcast(getcolumnbyordinal(0, StringType), StringType, - root class: java.lang.String).toString.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe source table of `MergeInto` uses `ScalaUDF`. The error happens when Spark invokes the deserializer of input encoder of the `ScalaUDF` and the deserializer is not resolved yet.\r\n\r\nThe encoders of ScalaUDF are resolved by the rule `ResolveEncodersInUDF` which will be applied at the end of analysis phase.\r\n\r\nDuring rewriting `MergeInto` to `ReplaceData` query, Spark creates an `Exists` subquery and `ScalaUDF` is part of the plan of the subquery. Note that the `ScalaUDF` is already resolved by the analyzer.\r\n\r\nThen, in `ResolveSubquery` rule which resolves the subquery, it will resolve the subquery plan if it is not resolved yet. Because the subquery containing `ScalaUDF` is resolved, the rule skips it so `ResolveEncodersInUDF` won't be applied on it. So the analyzed `ReplaceData` query contains a `ScalaUDF` with encoders unresolved that cause the error.\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies `ResolveSubquery` so it will resolve subquery plan if it is not analyzed to make sure subquery plan is fully analyzed.\r\n\r\nThis patch moves `ResolveEncodersInUDF` rule before rewriting `MergeInto` to make sure the `ScalaUDF` in the subquery plan is fully analyzed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixing production query error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, fixing user-facing issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually test with `MergeInto` query and add an unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nReplace INVALID_VIEW_TEXT (SQLSTATE: XX000) error-condition which is forced when view expansion fails to parse with the underlying error.\r\nThe reason being that the underlying error has important information AND it is much more likely that view expansion fails because of a behavior change in the parser than some nefarious action or simple corruption.\r\nFor example the recent removal of `!` and `NOT` equivalence fails old view on on Spark 4.0 if they exploit the unsupported syntax.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change we also include the Query context summary in the ParserException processing.\r\nThis will expose the view name along side the view query error message.    \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBetter error handling improving ability of customers to do root cause analysis.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nWe are now giving more error context in case of parer errors and specifically in case of parser errors in view expansion\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting QA\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-07-18T19:00:48Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T18:29:45Z","closed_at":"2024-07-22T18:24:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7df39b548d8204eeed059f6581b98fe7cfec8277","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47405/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47405/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47405/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/38bfb6e568b0cc532e659105a51cef3e5efeeaca","head":{"label":"srielau:SPARK-48929-Fix-view-intrenal-error","ref":"SPARK-48929-Fix-view-intrenal-error","sha":"38bfb6e568b0cc532e659105a51cef3e5efeeaca","user":{"login":"srielau","id":3514644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3514644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau","html_url":"https://github.com/srielau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":399207476,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTkyMDc0NzY=","name":"spark","full_name":"srielau/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srielau","id":3514644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTQ2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3514644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau","html_url":"https://github.com/srielau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srielau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srielau/spark","description":"Apache

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSQL standard states that the variables can be declared only immediately after BEGIN.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUsers will get an error if they try to declare variable in the scope that is not started with BEGIN and ended with END or if the declarations are not immediately after BEGIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTests are in SqlScriptingParserSuite. There are 2 tests for now, if declarations are correctly written and if declarations are not written immediately after BEGIN. There is a TODO to write the test if declaration is located in the scope that is not BEGIN END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPrevious PRs introduced basic changes for SQL Scripting.\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to introduce changes to SQL API in `SparkSession` to support execution of compound statements.\r\n\r\nSQL Config `SQL_SCRIPTING_ENABLED` is added to enable usage of SQL Scripting.\r\n\r\n`CompoundNestedStatementIteratorExec` is removed since it is an unnecessary abstraction layer.\r\n\r\n#### Statement flags\r\n`isInternal` flag is still existing to indicate if statement is added by us (generated during tree transformation for example to drop variables). We will see in the future if we still need this flag.\r\n\r\n`shouldCollectResult` is indicating whether we should collect and potentially return result or to throw is away.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change is needed to open the possibility for users to execute and get results from sql scripts.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nUsers will now see be able to execute sql scripts using `spark.sql()` API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere are tests for newly introduced execution changes:\r\n\r\n`SqlScriptingExecutionNodeSuite` - updated unit tests for execution nodes.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-07-18T12:51:13Z","updated_at":"2024-10-11T19:49:00Z","closed_at":"2024-10-11T19:49:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e9b9b71060385e06ff08f7ca80f7bfae6037da32","head":{"label":"miland-db:sql_batch_execution","ref":"sql_batch_execution","sha":"e9b9b71060385e06ff08f7ca80f7bfae6037da32","user":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768539955,"node_id":"R_kgDOLc79Mw","name":"spark","full_name":"miland-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add the support of `--remote` at `bin/spark-shell` so it can use Spark Connect easily.\r\n\r\nAt high level:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --remote \"local[*]\"\r\n...\r\nspark.range(10).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Start `ConnectRepl`\r\n2. Start the Spark Connect server locally at `ConnectRepl.scala`\r\n3. Create a Spark Connect client, and expose it to the shell users\r\n4. When users exit, Spark Connect server is also terminated.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --remote \"sc://localhost\"\r\n...\r\nspark.range(10).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Start `ConnectRepl`\r\n2. Create a Spark Connect client, and expose it to the shell users\r\n\r\nThe approach of classpath handling is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Place all Spark Connect REPL related dependencies and jars into `jars/connect-repl`.\r\n- Only when we run Spark Connect shell, we load the dependencies at `jars/connect-repl` (and exclude Spark Classic jars, and jars shaded in Spark Connect client).\r\n\r\nIn order to allow configurations set in Spark Shell, this PR leverages properties (that already contains Spark configurations), and set it in the Spark Connect client. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`bin/pyspark --remote` also works. In order for end users to try Spark Connect out, should have the consistent way.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, now `bin/spark-shell` supports `--remote` option.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --remote \"local[*]\"\r\n...\r\nspark.range(10).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n./sbin/start-connect-server.sh --wait\r\n...\r\n./bin/spark-shell --remote \"sc://localhost\"\r\n...\r\nspark.range(10).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --remote \"local[*]\" --conf spark.sql.ansi.enabled=false\r\n...\r\nspark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --remote \"local[*]\" --conf spark.sql.ansi.enabled=false --conf spark.abcabc=abc --conf spark.sql.debug=true\r\n...\r\nspark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.debug\")\r\nspark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n./sbin/start-connect-server.sh --wait\r\n...\r\n./bin/spark-shell --remote \"sc://localhost\" --conf spark.sql.ansi.enabled=false --conf spark.abcabc=abc --conf spark.sql.debug=true\r\n...\r\nspark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.debug\")\r\nspark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-07-18T11:49:12Z","updated_at":"2024-08-12T02:00:36Z","closed_at":"2024-08-11T01:18:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47ba41951e46c58212780d7e556a8240d45cb284","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406628559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI4NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SHELL","name":"SPARK

fix an `miss` check in UT.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen checking the `RuntimeReplaceable` expression in UT, there is no need to write as `checkEvaluation(Collation(Literal(\"abc\")).replacement, \"UTF8_BINARY\")`, because it has already undergone a similar replacement

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe found a race condition in our prod jobs when executor finished registration but when the it starts to heartbeat, the driver tells the executor is still unknown. We proposed to sync the executor registration status directly between the `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` and the `HeartbeatReciever` to prevent the race condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt caused by the `HeartbeatReciever` is only hearing any registered executor from `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend ` through the message bus, and by the nature of the asynchronous message delivering mechanism of message bus, there is no guarantee of how long it can take between message posting and message receiving. In our prod failure job case, the time is longer than 2min (the interval between executor finished registration and started the heartbeat), so it caused the inconsistent states of which executors were registered between `HeartbeatReciever` and `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test and we've been running this fix in our production for a while and no failure from this race condition happened any more.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, during the state store maintenance process, we find which old version files of the **RocksDB** state store to delete by listing all existing snapshotted version files in the checkpoint directory every 1 minute by default. The frequent list calls in the cloud can result in high costs. To address this concern and reduce the cost associated with state store maintenance, we should aim to minimize the frequency of listing object stores inside the maintenance task. To minimize the frequency, we will try to accumulate versions to delete and only call list when the number of versions to delete reaches a configured threshold. \r\n\r\nThe changes include:\r\n1.  Adding new configuration variable `ratioExtraSpaceAllowedInCheckpoint` in **SQLConf**. This determines the ratio of extra versions files we want to retain in the checkpoint directory compared to number of versions to retain for rollbacks (`minBatchesToRetain`).\r\n2. Using this config and `minBatchesToRetain`, set `minVersionsToDelete` config inside **StateStoreConf** to `minVersionsToDelete = ratioExtraVersionsAllowedInCheckpoint * minBatchesToRetain.`\r\n3.  Using `minSeenVersion` and `maxSeenVersion` variables in **RocksDBFileManager** to estimate min/max version present in directory and control deletion frequency. This is done by ensuring number of stale versions to delete is at least `minVersionsToDelete`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, maintenance operations like snapshotting, purging, deletion, and file management is done asynchronously for each data partition. We want to shift away periodic deletion and instead rely on the estimated number of files in the checkpoint directory to reduce list calls and introduce batch deletion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to redact `awsAccessKeyId` by including `accesskey` pattern.\r\n\r\n- **Apache Spark 4.0.0-preview1**\r\nThere is no point to redact `fs.s3a.access.key` because the same value is exposed via `fs.s3.awsAccessKeyId` like the following. We need to redact all.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=A AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=B bin/spark-shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-07-17 at 12 45 44](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3040c5d-3eb9-4944-a6d6-5179b7647426)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 1.1.0, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` is propagated like the following. However, Apache Spark does not redact them all consistently. \r\n- #450\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5d16c3134c442a5546251fd7c42b1da9fdf3969e/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkHadoopUtil.scala#L481-L486\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUsers may see more redactions on configurations whose name contains `accesskey` case-insensitively. However, those configurations are highly likely to be related to the credentials.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly added test cases.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis pull request proposes logging a warning message when the `.unpersist()` method is called on RDDs that have been locally checkpointed. The goal is to inform users about the potential risks associated with unpersisting locally checkpointed RDDs without changing the current behavior of the method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLocal checkpointing truncates the lineage of an RDD, preventing it from being recomputed from its source. If a locally checkpointed RDD is unpersisted, it loses its data and cannot be regenerated, potentially leading to job failures if subsequent actions or transformations are attempted on the RDD (which was seen on some user workloads). Logging a warning message helps users avoid such pitfalls and aids in debugging.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, this PR adds a warning log message when .unpersist() is called on a locally checkpointed RDD, but it does not alter any existing behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR does not change any existing behavior and therefore no tests are added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nExtends previous work in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46839, allowing the grouping expressions to be bound to outer references.\r\n\r\nMost common example is \r\n`select *, (select count(*) from T_inner where cast(T_inner.x as date) = T_outer.date group by cast(T_inner.x as date))`\r\n\r\nHere, we group by cast(T_inner.x as date) which is bound to an outer row. This guarantees that for every outer row, there is exactly one value of cast(T_inner.x as date), so it is safe to group on it. \r\nPreviously, we required that only columns can be bound to outer expressions, thus forbidding such subqueries.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nExtends supported subqueries\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, previously failing queries are now passing\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nQuery tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe got a customer issue that a `MergeInto` query on Iceberg table works earlier but cannot work after upgrading to Spark 3.4.\r\n\r\nThe error looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkRuntimeException: Error while decoding: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedException: Invalid call to nullable on unresolved object\r\nupcast(getcolumnbyordinal(0, StringType), StringType, - root class: java.lang.String).toString.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe source table of `MergeInto` uses `ScalaUDF`. The error happens when Spark invokes the deserializer of input encoder of the `ScalaUDF` and the deserializer is not resolved yet.\r\n\r\nThe encoders of ScalaUDF are resolved by the rule `ResolveEncodersInUDF` which will be applied at the end of analysis phase.\r\n\r\nDuring rewriting `MergeInto` to `ReplaceData` query, Spark creates an `Exists` subquery and `ScalaUDF` is part of the plan of the subquery. Note that the `ScalaUDF` is already resolved by the analyzer.\r\n\r\nThen, in `ResolveSubquery` rule which resolves the subquery, it will resolve the subquery plan if it is not resolved yet. Because the subquery containing `ScalaUDF` is resolved, the rule skips it so `ResolveEncodersInUDF` won't be applied on it. So the analyzed `ReplaceData` query contains a `ScalaUDF` with encoders unresolved that cause the error.\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies `ResolveSubquery` so it will resolve subquery plan if it is not analyzed to make sure subquery plan is fully analyzed.\r\n\r\nThis patch moves `ResolveEncodersInUDF` rule before rewriting `MergeInto` to make sure the `ScalaUDF` in the subquery plan is fully analyzed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixing production query error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, fixing user-facing issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually test with `MergeInto` query and add an unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe changes can be grouped into two categories:\r\n\r\n- **Add `reason` field for all internal calls for job/stage cancellation**\r\n  - Cancel because of exceptions:\r\n    - org/apache/spark/sql/connect/execution/ExecuteThreadRunner.scala\r\n    - org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/BroadcastExchangeExec.scala\r\n    - sql/hive-thriftserver/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/thriftserver/SparkExecuteStatementOperation.scala\r\n   - Cancel by user (Web UI):\r\n      - org/apache/spark/ui/jobs/JobsTab.scala \r\n   - Cancel when streaming terminates/query ends:\r\n     - org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/MicroBatchExecution.scala\r\n     - org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/continuous/ContinuousExecution.scala\r\n     \r\n_(Developers familiar with these components: would appreciate it if you could provide suggestions for more helpful cancellation reason strings! :) )_\r\n\r\n- **API Change for `JobWaiter`**\r\nCurrently, the `.cancel()` function in `JobWaiter` does not allow specifying a reason for cancellation. This limitation prevents us from reporting cancellation reasons in AQE, such as cleanup or canceling unnecessary jobs after query replanning. To address this, we should add an `reason: String` parameter to all relevant APIs along the chain.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"936\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/239cbcd6-8d78-446a-98d0-456e5e837494\">\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nToday it is difficult to determine why a job, stage, or job group was canceled. We should leverage existing Spark functionality to provide a reason string explaining the cancellation cause, and should add new APIs to let us provide this reason when canceling job groups. For more context, please read [this JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48900).\r\n\r\nThis feature can be implemented in two PRs:\r\n1. [Modify the current SparkContext and its downstream APIs to add the reason string, such as cancelJobGroup and cancelJobsWithTag](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47361)\r\n2. Add reasons for all internal calls to these methods.\r\n\r\n**Note: This is the second of the two PRs to implement this new feature**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt adds reasons for jobs and stages cancelled internally, providing users with clearer explanations for cancellations by Spark, such as exceptions, end of streaming, AQE query replanning, etc.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTests for the API changes on the `JobWaiter` chain are added in `JobCancellationSuite.scala`\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the TypeTag look up during `udaf.toColumn` failed in Maven test env with the following error:\r\n\r\n>

PR changes the mirror-matching logic from `eq` to `hasCommonAncestors`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPrevious logic fails in tests env.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-07-16T11:24:49Z","updated_at":"2024-07-17T23:14:22Z","closed_at":"2024-07-17T01:38:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2304020aae9bc486d0cc029ea06c9d74754e5bc2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c3002a1f2eb540196f679b64228feb6053e1398a","head":{"label":"xupefei:udaf-tocolumn-fixup","ref":"udaf-tocolumn-fixup","sha":"c3002a1f2eb540196f679b64228feb6053e1398a","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse `HashSet` instead of doing linear searches over the `Seq`. In case of 1000s of partitions this significantly improves the performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- fix the value `explicitTypes` in `COLLATION_MISMATCH.EXPLICIT`.\r\n- use `checkError` to check exception in `CollationSQLExpressionsSuite` and `CollationStringExpressionsSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOnly fix bug, eg:\r\n```\r\nSELECT concat_ws(' ', collate('Spark', 'UTF8_LCASE'), collate('SQL', 'UNICODE'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Before:\r\n  ```\r\n  [COLLATION_MISMATCH.EXPLICIT] Could not determine which collation to use for string functions and operators.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the optional `reason` field for `cancelJobGroup` and `cancelJobsWithTag` in `SparkContext.scala`, while keeping the old APIs without the `reason`, similar to how `cancelJob` is implemented currently.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nToday it is difficult to determine why a job, stage, or job group was canceled. We should leverage existing Spark functionality to provide a reason string explaining the cancellation cause, and should add new APIs to let us provide this reason when canceling job groups.\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n\r\nSince [SPARK-19549](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19549) Allow providing reasons for stage/job cancelling - ASF JIRA (Spark 2.20), Spark’s cancelJob and cancelStage methods accept an optional reason: String that is added to logging output and user-facing error messages when jobs or stages are canceled. In our internal calls to these methods, we should always supply a reason. For example, we should set an appropriate reason when the “kill” links are clicked in the Spark UI (see [code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b14c1f036f8f394ad1903998128c05d04dd584a9/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ui/jobs/JobsTab.scala#L54C1-L55)).\r\nOther APIs currently lack a reason field. For example, cancelJobGroup and cancelJobsWithTag don’t provide any way to specify a reason, so we only see generic logs like “asked to cancel job group <group name>”. We should add an ability to pass in a group cancellation reason and thread that through into the scheduler’s logging and job failure reasons.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be implemented in two PRs:\r\n\r\n1. Modify the current SparkContext and its downstream APIs to add the reason string, such as cancelJobGroup and cancelJobsWithTag\r\n\r\n2. Add reasons for all internal calls to these methods.\r\n\r\n**Note: This is the first of the two PRs to implement this new feature**\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it modifies the SparkContext API, allowing users to add an optional `reason: String` to `cancelJobsWithTags` and `cancelJobGroup`, while the old methods without the `reason` are also kept. This creates a more uniform interface where the user can supply an optional reason for all job/stage cancellation calls.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew tests are added to `JobCancellationSuite` to test the reason fields for these calls.\r\n\r\nFor the API changes in R and PySpark, tests are added to these files:\r\n- R/pkg/tests/fulltests/test_context.R\r\n- python/pyspark/tests/test_pin_thread.py\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

PR follows https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45930 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46302 (which is open as of the creation of this PR) to enable shuffle file cleanup for all SQL executions, not just Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nThe prior PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45930 introduces two new configs: `spark.sql.shuffleDependency.skipMigration.enabled` and `spark.sql.shuffleDependency.fileCleanup.enabled`. These two configs are not specifically namespaced to Spark Connect and I'd like to make sure we can use them from all QueryExecutions. Before this PR, only Spark Connect could enable it.\r\n\r\nMy change is to move the check for `shuffleCleanupMode` inside of `QueryExecution`, instead of having that be passed to this class in the constructor. I also am explicitly turning on these features in the tests, rather than using `Utils.isTesting`. \r\n\r\nI would love to hear any concerns on why we shouldn't do this or what testing you want to see. I have run Standalone tests (note I needed https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46302) and can run other tests if required or can code
