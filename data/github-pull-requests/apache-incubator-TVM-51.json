PR adds a TE implementation of LSTM (with optional modifications, similar to those in https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/relay/frontend/common.py#L774), using the `te.scan` construct (so that the recurrent loop is truly a sequential loop, rather than unrolled statically). This compute should support symbolic sequence length.\r\n\r\nMissing from this PR:\r\n- optimized schedule for any target\r\n- corresponding higher-level Relay op\r\n- attempts to use metaschedule (more on this later)\r\n\r\nI'll send a follow-up PR for the Relay op, but scheduling the LSTM might take a while (if anyone is interested, please feel free to take a stab!). The main thing to optimize is the dense operations within the kernel (the initial input-hidden dense, recurrent hidden-hidden dense, and hidden-projection dense). I couldn't figure out a great way to use existing schedules here...\r\n\r\nThings I am hoping to try:\r\n- Fix some variant of LSTM and write an S-TIR kernel for it, then try to schedule individual blocks (maybe reusing existing stuff if possible). Because LSTM has a lot of optional stuff, I'm not sure how easy it would be to do tvmscript-level metaprogramming to inject optional computations etc.\r\n- Once the Relay op is up, add a cuDNN strategy as an option for NVIDIA gpus\r\n\r\nRegarding metascheduling: the current `CreatePrimFunc` conversion from TE -> S-TIR doesn't support scan operations. I have a hack that makes this conversion work, but am hitting some snags regarding schedule rules, primitives, and post procs (the outer scan axis seems to break a lot of assumptions). I can try to clean up this conversion if that's valuable, but also am curious if anyone is interested in tackling this by adjusting the constraints on blocks to support outer scan axis.\r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @junrushao1994 @tkonolige @michalpiszczek @masahi \r\n\r\nAdditional thanks to @vinx13 and @zxybazh for helping debug metaschedule issues (I hope this PR helps as a concrete starting point for getting things working), maybe you guys can cc others who may be interested? And thanks @junrushao1994 for the very helpful LSTM example from ~5 (!) years ago https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/apps/topi_recipe/rnn/lstm.py which I used as a starting

adds additional simplifications to `RewriteSimplifier` while inside a conditional statement.  These are simplifications that are expected to be necessary for simplifying conditionals for padding buffer transforms.  The main additions are below:\r\n\r\n* Use of `RewriteSimplifier::literal_constraints_` for simplifications of boolean expressions.  Previously, this was only used for simplifications inside a `tir.likely` annotation.\r\n* Use of `RewriteSimplifier::literal_constraints_` to identify known false constraints.  This allows a constraint of `i!=n` to simplify `i==n` to false.\r\n* Use of `EqNode` constraints in `ConstIntBoundAnalyzer`.  Previously, inequalities were used as comparisons.  With this change an `i==5` constraint be used to reduce the bounds of `i` to

0-dimensional computation, `te.CreatePrimFunc` creates an opaque block with 0 block iters, which is mistakenly passed into TVMScript auto-completion that failed to add the root block properly. As an example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>> from tvm import te\r\n>> a = te.placeholder((), name=\"a\", dtype=\"int32\")\r\n>> b = te.placeholder((), name=\"b\", dtype=\"int32\")\r\n>> c =

patch is to enhance the performance of DNNL BYOC dense operators by 1) introducing gelu fusion and ~~2) introducing alter dense weight layout.~~ (Implemented after merging PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11345, Thanks @apeskov )\r\n\r\nWhy do we introduce gelu fusion:\r\nFor the model family of BERT, GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) activation is used heavily so if we perform gelu fusion in those models, then we gain a better performance boost. \r\n\r\nWhy do we introduce automatically packed dense and its altered weight layout:\r\nFormat tag::ab (aka. tag::NC) is not the best format selected by DNNL inner_product primitive. It is a drawback in current DNNL BYOC module.\r\n\r\nFor what model it fit in:\r\nDense intensity type such as Bert family\r\n\r\nWith this patch, I benchmarked the inference performance of a kind of vision-tranformer called PCPVT (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13840) on ICX-8352Y. Here is some boost data:\r\n\r\n| 32 cores |Latency (dev)  |\r\n|--|--|\r\n| baseline byoc | 11.45ms | \r\n| byoc w/ patch|  7.93ms |\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

encountered a quirk today when using the PyTorch importer. My local PyTorch version is 1.5.1 and it uses Cuda (10.1 on my system), so `torch.__version__` returns `1.5.1+cu101`.\r\n\r\nWhen I used the importer I encountered the following error:\r\n```\r\n  File \"/home/sslyu/tvm/python/tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py\", line 4064, in from_pytorch\r\n    _run_jit_passes(graph, enable_lower_all_tuples)\r\n  File \"/home/sslyu/tvm/python/tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py\", line 3637, in _run_jit_passes\r\n    torch._C._jit_pass_onnx_function_substitution(graph)\r\nAttributeError: module 'torch._C' has no attribute '_jit_pass_onnx_function_substitution'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is because PT version 1.5.1 doesn't have that function. In principle, the importer should check for that and not use that function for versions that don't have it, which is the logic here: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/119afda6344785aee5cf1729eec30624ac068f33/python/tvm/relay/frontend/pytorch.py#L3628-L3642\r\n\r\nHowever, the \"+cu101\" in the version number causes `is_version_greater_than` to return true. This change disregards the \"+cu\" code in the version number for that comparison.","created_at":"2022-05-30T21:44:14Z","updated_at":"2022-05-31T00:45:02Z","closed_at":"2022-05-30T23:53:01Z","merged_at":"2022-05-30T23:53:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc14f26aca1963a3ab858afa92a799729f6bd145","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11511/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11511/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11511/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/a613b2a34906155cd6739d2e3ddb654704c959bd","head":{"label":"slyubomirsky:pt-version-check","ref":"pt-version-check","sha":"a613b2a34906155cd6739d2e3ddb654704c959bd","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":149190623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDkxOTA2MjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"slyubomirsky/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky/tvm","description":"Open

patch is to enable layer normalization in DNNL BYOC by providing an out-of-box rewrite pattern for combining the operators into a single relay layer normalization operator as well as its implementation in dnnl json codegen.\r\n\r\nAfter applying the rewrite pattern, we will observe the following dnnl function:\r\n```\r\n6202 def @tvmgen_default_dnnl_main_108(%dnnl_108_i0: Tensor[(1, 784, 128), float32], Inline=1, Compiler=\"dnnl\", global_symbol=\"tvmgen_default_dnnl_main_108\", Primitive=1) -> Tensor[(1, 784, 128), float32] {\r\n6203   nn.layer_norm(%dnnl_108_i0, meta[relay.Constant][56] /* ty=Tensor[(128), float32] */, meta[relay.Constant][57] /* ty=Tensor[(128), float32] */) /* ty=Tensor[(1,  784, 128), float32] */\r\n6204 }\r\n```\r\nOnce you enable DNNL_VERBOSE flag, more informations are shown in log file as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nonednn_verbose,exec,cpu,layer_normalization,simple_layer_normalization:any,forward_inference,data_f32::blocked:abc:f0 stats_undef::undef::f0 diff_undef::undef::f0,,flags:CH,1x784x128,0.0551758\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this patch, I benchmarked the inference performance of a kind of vision-tranformer called PCPVT (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13840) on ICX-8352Y. It gains up to 1.18X boost. Here is some boost data:\r\n\r\n| 32 cores |Latency |\r\n|--|--|\r\n| baseline byoc | 11.45ms | \r\n| byoc w/ patch| 9.68ms  |\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

a hardcoded index in `access_ptr` rewriting, which assumes that the number of stages is 2.\r\n\r\nRefactored MMA code in [test_tir_schedule_tensorize_ldmatrix_mma.py](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11495/files#diff-c57055a7e086b01384ea58abb7e2126904427357e02ec6ff5369360d344dfe0b), so that it can be used by other tests. The new test in `test_tir_transform_inject_software_pipeline.py` applies software pipelining annotations to the MMA-tensorized schedule with `software_pipeline_stage = [0, 0, 3]`, which makes global to shared load pipelined with depth 4. Without async copy, this is not useful for performance. But it does demonstrate that a multi-stage pipeline with depth > 2 works on a semi-realistic GPU schedule.\r\n\r\nThe test uses large dynamic shared memory, which serves as a test case for

the SelectNode comes from the test_opencl_ternary_expression test:\r\n```\r\ntrue_value false_value cond\r\nint8 int8 bool\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's was generating the **[OpenCL select function](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/select.html)** from the node.\r\nThe problem is that [the function signatures are strict](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/3606da5fbad042e2b74a35404797af20f65b437b/clang/lib/Headers/opencl-c.h#L11034) and would make it **generate ambiguous calls** with the case already in the testsuite.\r\n\r\nAccording to **[OCL spec 6.3.9. Ternary Selection Operator](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/2.2/html/OpenCL_C.html#operators-ternary-selection)**, the ternary selection operator is **equivalent to calling with select** but without the difficulty of casting the operands to avoid ambiguous cases.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, the mentioned test passed. The generated kernels are still equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!   Please refer to guideline https://tvm.apache.org/docs/contribute/ for useful information and tips.

turns out to be a fundamental datastructure in Collage. This PR gives it some polish.\r\n - Avoid unnecessary copies.\r\n - Hide implementation so access violations are easy to spot.\r\n - Add notion of basic block to IndexedGraph<T>::Node so Collage can avoid unioning sub-graphs which cross control flow boundaries.\r\n - Make sure dataflow graph is always a DAG, even with let-rec bound functions.\r\n - Fix dataflow order for let-binding to be from let-bound value to let-bound var to all uses of let-bound var.\r\n - Make sure all the Relay constructs are accounted for.\r\n - Add C++ unit test (since not intended to be an FFI-friendly

adds a command to restart CI runs that have stopped (either from a failure, success, or abort) via GitHub comments addressed to tvm-bot:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@tvm-bot rerun\r\n```\r\n\r\ntvm-bot will then comment on the thread and send a request to Jenkins to restart CI. This does not restart GitHub Actions jobs though we may be able to add that in the future. Some of this PR also restructures how the GitHub Actions workflow receives events, before it had to look through a list of comments and decide if it should act, this changes it to only operate on the one comment from the triggering webhook itself so it's more straightforward.\n\ncc @Mousius

we have functioning dynamic shared memory support on cuda. But we haven't actually explored allocating more than 48KB of dynamic shmem. \r\n\r\nThis PR updates the cuda runtime to support launching a kernel which wants to use dyn shmem of size > 48KB. This is already useful for manually rewritten schedules, but to integrate this feature into tuning requires more work (see the discussion on `VerifyGPUCode` below). \r\n\r\nI'll add a test which actually uses a big dyn shmem in the next PR (need to fix one bug in software pipelining transform). \r\n\r\nReference in cutlass

https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/byoc-supporting-cutlass-byoc-with-collage/12796/6 for\r\ncontext, which in turn is part of Collage (https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0062-collage.md).\r\n\r\nFor reasons explained in the above thread I'm moving CUTLASS to be IRModule-at-a-time external codegen\r\nusing a custom RelayToTIR pass instead of the traditional function-at-a-time external codegen using\r\na relay.ext.cutlass registered function. This means some of the rewriting done on-the-fly by LowerTEPass now\r\nneeds to be done by the custom pass directly. This PR supplies two passes which ease that burden:\r\n - Before starting the extern-codegen specific processing, make sure all \"Compiler\" attributed functions have\r\n   unique global definitions (ie are outlined). Though functions start in this form after BYOC partitioning,\r\n   under Graph and AOT compilation flows those functions are then inlined to pass through the 'codegen' keyhole\r\n   which assumes the whole model is just one self-contained main function. This pass will undo that. (I gave up\r\n   trying to just remove the inlining in the first place.)\r\n - After the extern-codegen specific processing the now compiled \"Compiler\" attributed functions need to marked as\r\n   'extern'. The te_compiler.cc uses the \"ExternalSymbol\" attribute for that. But since a) the symbol name\r\n   on that attribute is never needed, only the presence of the attribute is significant downstream and b) \"ExternalSymbol\"\r\n   is easy to confuse with \"global_symbol\", I also replace \"ExternalSymbol\" with \"Extern\" with an Integer(1) value\r\n   (cf \"Primitive\").\r\n\r\n The outlining pass is a little more general than necessary because it (will also) be used by Collage to\r\n rewrite the IRModule into optimally partitioned form while making maximal reuse of structurally equal partitioned\r\n functions. Hence the abstract GlobalSymbolCache.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-26T18:12:02Z","updated_at":"2022-06-03T20:39:09Z","closed_at":"2022-06-03T20:19:54Z","merged_at":"2022-06-03T20:19:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"9dceb4e191c5588046c1478243d031f0b6052311","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11474/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/11474/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/11474/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f88b5a83b0886b2edaa4c7248cb3db28e148c77e","head":{"label":"mbs-octoml:mbs-collage-compiler-function","ref":"mbs-collage-compiler-function","sha":"f88b5a83b0886b2edaa4c7248cb3db28e148c77e","user":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":386444680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODY0NDQ2ODA=","name":"mbs-tvm","full_name":"mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbs-octoml","id":87091372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDkxMzcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87091372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml","html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbs-octoml/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbs-octoml/mbs-tvm","description":"Open

It\r\nallows external codegen toolchains to yield a result which:\r\n - Like CSource modules, can be conveyed directly to the final export_library compilation\r\n   step for linking into the final .so and saved to a know location without risk the\r\n   underlying code artifact will be lost.\r\n - Like DSOLibrary modules, are self contained so that no additional compile-time arguments\r\n   need be conveyed from the CSource module to the final export_library command line\r\n\r\nSince this is the third flavor of 'DSO exportable' module, add a Module::IsDSOExportable.\r\n\r\nSince adding the above, can't resist also adding a Module::ImplementsFunction virtual and\r\ncalling it from TEComplier to check if an external codegen function actually provided the\r\nimplementation it promised.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n - I've left the existing implementation of runtime.load_module alone which\r\n   relinks .o files to .so files.\r\n - Though also contained in the .o metadata, I require

pool timeout would not function in the case of long running c++ code. It relied on a python `threading.Timer` to interrupt the process after a certain amount of time. However python timers cannot interrupt c++ code (or any other code besides python). Instead we now use a subprocess (via python's `multiprocessing`) to kill the worker process after the timeout expires. This works no matter what code is being run.\r\n\r\nNote that this means that TimeoutErrors are never reported because we have no way of distinguishing between timeouts and subprocesses dying. I think this is a worthwhile tradeoff because we can run into situations where autotvm takes forever to tune because it is waiting on a really slow to compile program.\r\n\r\n@tqchen

we use `EstimateRegionLowerBound` to determine allocation extents, sometimes it gives \"too accurate\" dynamic region extents (dependent by outer loop vars).  However, the lowering (`StorageRewrite`) would lift buffer allocation to the global scope, bring the loop vars out of it's def scope illegally.\r\n\r\nFor the padded and tiled pooling case in the test, the h-dimension's region extent could be infered as `h_o * 8 + 8 - max(h_o * 8 - 1, 0)`, it is correct since with padding, the edge tiles do not need same buffer size as others. (h_o = 0 => extent = 8, h_o > 0 => extent = 9). But the dynamic allocation for this extent expression can not get properly handled afterwards... \r\n\r\nHere is just one work-around, very glad to see any robust solutions. @Hzfengsy @spectrometerHBH

PR extends `DetectIterMap` bijective check to allow unused zero-constant iterators (trivial iterators). For example, `i, j, k => i, j` are treated as bijective if `k \\in [0, 1)`, even though `k` is not used in the mapping result.\r\nPreviously, when trivial iterators are simplified, the above iter map can pass bijective check. When `simplify_trivial_iterators==False`, `k` will not be simplified and `DetectIterMap` will fail if `require_bijective` is set. This PR make the behavior of `DetectIterMap` consistent with different setting of `simplify_trivial_iteraotor`.\r\nRegression tests for `reverse_compute_inline` is also added.\r\n\r\ncc
