run(s). The state is reset when all the issues are processed. This should be considered for scheduling workflow runs.</li>\n<li>Version 9 of this action updated the runtime to Node.js 20.

using the utility, I noticed that the logs were displayed incorrectly. \r\nI found a similar problem in Jira, but I think the `[INFO ]` output is correct, but the space after it is a consequence of incorrect logger settings, which I corrected.\r\nAlso update log message.\r\n\r\nJIRA issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-820\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed\r\nfor the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not\r\nrequire a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\nwhere you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\nis to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under

These methods update the original DOM, as well as the Elements list.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2017\">jhy/jsoup#2017</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the NodeIterator class, to efficiently traverse a node tree using the Iterator interface. And\nadded Stream Element#stream() and Node#nodeStream() methods, to enable fluent composable stream pipelines of node\ntraversals.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2051\">jhy/jsoup#2051</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when changing the OutputSettings syntax to XML, the xhtml EscapeMode is automatically set by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the <code>:is(selector list)</code> pseudo-selector, which finds elements that match any of the selectors in\nthe selector list. Useful for making large ORed selectors more readable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: repackaged the library with native (vs automatic) JPMS module support.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2025\">jhy/jsoup#2025</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: better fidelity of source positions when tracking is enabled. And implicitly created or closed elements\nare tracked and detectable via Range.isImplicit().\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2056\">jhy/jsoup#2056</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when source tracking is enabled, the source position for attribute names and values is now available.\nAttribute#sourceRange() provides the ranges.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2057\">jhy/jsoup#2057</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when running concurrently under Java 21+ Virtual Threads, virtual threads could be pinned to their\ncarrier platform thread when parsing an input stream. To improve performance, particularly when parsing fetched\nURLs, the internal ConstrainableInputStream has been replaced by ControllableInputStream, which avoids the locking\nwhich caused that pinning.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2054\">jhy/jsoup#2054</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Jsoup.Connect, allow any XML mimetype as a supported mimetype. Was previously limited to\n<code>{application|text}/xml</code>. This enables for e.g. fetching SVGs with a image/svg+xml mimetype, without having to\ndisable mimetype validation.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2059\">jhy/jsoup#2059</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when outputting with XML syntax, HTML elements that were parsed as data nodes (<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) should\nbe emitted as CDATA nodes, so that they can be parsed correctly by an XML parser.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1720\">jhy/jsoup#1720</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the Immediate Parent selector <code>&gt;</code> could match elements above the root context element, causing incorrect\nelements to be returned when used on elements other than the root document.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Flakiness\r\n**Nondex** was used to check and locate the flakiness in the test. The test can be reproduced using the following command:\r\n```shell\r\nmvn install -pl support/cdi -am -DskipTests\r\nmvn -pl support/cdi test -Dtest=org.apache.shiro.cdi.AnnotatedTypeWrapperTest#removeAnnotations\r\nmvn -pl support/cdi edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.shiro.cdi.AnnotatedTypeWrapperTest#removeAnnotations\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Issue\r\nThe test checks that if there is no `Annotation` in the `RequiresGuest` class and there is `Annotation` in `SessionScoped` class. It retrieves these classes by calling `getDeclaredAnnotations` method and fix indexing on the array returned. This creates the problem. Here is the implementation of  `getDeclaredAnnotations` :\r\n```java\r\npublic Annotation[] getDeclaredAnnotations() {\r\n     return AnnotationParser.toArray(this.annotationData().declaredAnnotations);\r\n}\r\n// this.annotationData().declaredAnnotationsdeclaredAnnotations is a map\r\nMap<Class<? extends Annotation>, Annotation> declaredAnnotations = ....\r\n```\r\nSince the array is created from a hashmap, the order of elements in the output of `getDeclaredAnnotations` is not determinstic. Therefore, the fix indexing creates flakiness.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\nSince only `SessionScoped`  and `RequiresGuest` are tested, those 2 classes are specificly extracted from the array instead of using indexing.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n - [x] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version

Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\n-->\n\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\n\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\n \nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\n \nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\n\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0,

your contribution quickly and easily:\n\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\n \nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\n \nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\n\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\n\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache

Evaluators\nare sorted by their relative execution cost, and executed in order of lower to higher cost. This speeds the\nmatching process by ensuring that simpler evaluations (such as a tag name match) are conducted prior to more\ncomplex evaluations (such as an attribute regex, or a deep child scan with a :has).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added support for <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags (and their children). This includes tag namespaces and case\npreservation on applicable tags and attributes.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2008\">jhy/jsoup#2008</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, HTML documents will be placed in the\n<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace by default, per the HTML5 spec. This can be controlled by setting\n<code>W3CDom#namespaceAware(false)</code>.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1848\">jhy/jsoup#1848</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: speed optimized the Structural Evaluators by memoizing previous evaluations. Particularly the <code>~</code>\n(any preceding sibling) and <code>:nth-of-type</code> selectors are improved.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1956\">jhy/jsoup#1956</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: tweaked the performance of the Element nextElementSibling, previousElementSibling, firstElementSibling,\nlastElementSibling, firstElementChild, and lastElementChild. They now inplace filter/skip in the child-node list, vs\nhaving to allocate and scan a complete Element filtered list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: optimized internal methods that previously called Element.children() to use filter/skip child-node list\naccessors instead, reducing new Element List allocations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: tweaked the performance of parsing :pseudo selectors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when using the <code>:empty</code> pseudo-selector, blank textnodes are now considered empty. Previously,\nan element containing any whitespace was not considered empty.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1976\">jhy/jsoup#1976</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in forms, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> should be excluded from formData() (and hence from form submissions).\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2010\">jhy/jsoup#2010</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Safelist, made isSafeTag and isSafeAttribute public methods, for extensibility.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1780\">jhy/jsoup#1780</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: <code>form</code> elements and empty elements (such as <code>img</code>) did not have their attributes de-duplicated.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1950\">jhy/jsoup#1950</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: if Document.OutputSettings was cloned from a clone, an NPE would be thrown when used.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1964\">jhy/jsoup#1964</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in Jsoup.connect(url), URL paths containing a %2B were incorrectly recoded to a '+', or a '+' was recoded\nto a ' '. Fixed by reverting to the previous behavior of not encoding supplied paths, other than normalizing to\nASCII.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1952\">jhy/jsoup#1952</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

plugin is 15 years old and has not been updated\nIt currently fails when detecting the Java version when using:\n> Java version: 11.0.20.1, vendor: Azul Systems, Inc.\n\n<!--\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\n-->\n\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\n\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\n \nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\n \nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\n\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\n\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

your contribution quickly and easily:\n\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/shiro/issues) filed \n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \n       require a GitHub issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[#XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\n       where you replace `#XXX` with the appropriate GitHub issue. Best practice\n       is to use the GitHub issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\n - [ ] add `fixes #XXX` if merging the PR should close a related issue.\n - [ ] Run `mvn verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \n - [ ] Committers: Make sure a milestone is set on the PR\n \nTrivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue (javadoc, comments...). \nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `[DOC] - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\n \nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\n\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\n\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License
