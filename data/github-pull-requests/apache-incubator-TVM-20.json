We then trigger a second round of warp-level primitive reduction within the first warp, and get the final reduction results.\r\n\r\nIn addition to using warp-level primitives, by doing this we also reduce the size of the shared memory. For example, even when reducing over 1024 threads, we now only require shared memory of size 32, compared with 1024 prior to this PR.\r\n\r\nTests are added to ensure correctness.","created_at":"2023-07-15T19:06:03Z","updated_at":"2023-07-18T03:01:52Z","closed_at":"2023-07-16T15:36:15Z","merged_at":"2023-07-16T15:36:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"e25b1ba70a27399fb4da257c521c1e2bbb178ad8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/bd3448e18e732b32a2113999b81e547ccf586fb1","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-07-15-multi-warp-allreduce","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-07-15-multi-warp-allreduce","sha":"bd3448e18e732b32a2113999b81e547ccf586fb1","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

PR introduces benchmarking tools for dynamic shape PrimFuncs and Relax. It facilitates the following functionalities:\r\n1. Automatically benchmark PrimFunc performance with user-speicified dynamic shape sampling function and input information. E.g., `n=random.randint(50, 100)` will benchmark performance of PrimFunc with Dynamic dimension `n` between 50-100.\r\n2. Extract self-contained PrimFunc benchmarking files from Relax Module. E.g., it can produce multiple python files for each function in a Relax Module and automatically extract dynamic shape input information from bindings.\r\n3. Conduct Relax Function level benchmarking using the same dynamic shape sample value across the Relax Function. E.g., the same value `n` is used consistently in a Relax Function for any PrimFunction call so we can figure out what is the performance bottleneck when we pin down the value of all dynamic dimensions like `n` or `m` (Yes, there could be multiple dynamic dimensions).\r\n4. It can automatically generate valid input even when the input is not the dynamic shape but the value of the dynamic dimension, which is `n`. This is specific to `rotatry_embedding` for now.\r\n\r\nCo-authored by @cyx-6\r\nThanks to @junrushao for advices.\r\n\r\nExample Usage\r\n```python\r\ndef benchmark_prim_func_full_rpc():\r\n    with

to this commit, if device initialization is required, the AOT main function produced a `call_extern()` that included the device context as input.  This commit updates the AOT main function to provide the device context only if the function being called accepts a device context as input.\r\n\r\nIf an extra device context argument is included at the call site, the C codegen would produce a function signature that includes the device context for the caller's compilation unit, but a signature without the device context for the callee's compilation unit.  While this can compile and run in some cases, it is undefined behavior for the signature to vary between compilation units, and should be avoided.\r\n\r\nThis was initially discovered while debugging

issue.","created_at":"2023-07-08T07:23:02Z","updated_at":"2023-07-14T10:20:47Z","closed_at":"2023-07-14T10:20:16Z","merged_at":"2023-07-14T10:20:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"b6502f4e278da391719155936aeefb6544115c1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/77dad0f3dbf4bde69ec9112b67cb96c58a28ae44","head":{"label":"haoyang9804:main","ref":"main","sha":"77dad0f3dbf4bde69ec9112b67cb96c58a28ae44","user":{"login":"haoyang9804","id":34816323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODE2MzIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34816323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyang9804","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyang9804","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyang9804/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyang9804/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyang9804/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyang9804/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyang9804/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyang9804/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyang9804/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyang9804/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyang9804/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"a0e7d3e0ae8d928909163fe12f31f2587c82f32c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

patch introduces new symbol: `T.macro`. `T.macro` is a decorator that, when applied to a function, turns the body of that function into a piece of TIR that can be inserted into a PrimFunc by calling the macro the same way as a function.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@T.macro\r\ndef copy_backwards(dst, src, size):\r\n    with T.block(\"backwards\"):\r\n        for i in T.serial(size):\r\n            ai = T.axis.remap(\"S\", [i])\r\n            T.reads(src[0:size])\r\n            T.writes(dst[0:size])\r\n            dst[ai] = src[size - ai - 1]\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef foo_int32(A: T.Buffer((128,), \"int32\"), B: T.Buffer((128,), \"int32\")):\r\n    copy_backwards(A, B, 128)\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef foo_int8(A: T.Buffer((128,), \"int8\"), B: T.Buffer((128,), \"int8\")):\r\n    copy_backwards(A, B, 128)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above will generate two PrimFuncs that do the same backwards copy, but applied to buffers with different data types.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef foo_int32(A: T.Buffer((128,), \"int32\"), B: T.Buffer((128,), \"int32\")):\r\n    # with T.block(\"root\"):\r\n    for i in range(128):\r\n        with T.block(\"copy\"):\r\n            ai = T.axis.spatial(128, i)\r\n            T.reads(B[0:128])\r\n            T.writes(A[0:128])\r\n            A[ai] = B[128 - ai - 1]\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef foo_int8(A: T.Buffer((128,), \"int8\"), B: T.Buffer((128,), \"int8\")):\r\n    # with T.block(\"root\"):\r\n    for i in range(128):\r\n        with T.block(\"copy\"):\r\n            ai = T.axis.spatial(128, i)\r\n            T.reads(B[0:128])\r\n            T.writes(A[0:128])\r\n            A[ai] = B[128 - ai - 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSemantics:\r\n- Function that is decorated with @T.macro can have any parameters that follow Python syntax, i.e. positional, keyword, etc. Type annotations are not required, but are allowed.\r\n- For `macro_name(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)`, the values are

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>SciPy 1.10.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>SciPy <code>1.10.0</code> is the culmination of <code>6</code> months of hard work. It contains\nmany new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and better\ndocumentation. There have been a number of deprecations and API changes\nin this release, which are documented below. All users are encouraged to\nupgrade to this release, as there are a large number of bug-fixes and\noptimizations. Before upgrading, we recommend that users check that\ntheir own code does not use deprecated SciPy functionality (to do so,\nrun your code with <code>python -Wd</code> and check for <code>DeprecationWarning</code> s).\nOur development attention will now shift to bug-fix releases on the\n1.10.x branch, and on adding new features on the main branch.</p>\n<p>This release requires Python <code>3.8+</code> and NumPy <code>1.19.5</code> or greater.</p>\n<p>For running on PyPy, PyPy3 <code>6.0+</code> is required.</p>\n<h1>Highlights of this release</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A new dedicated datasets submodule (<code>scipy.datasets</code>) has been added, and is\nnow preferred over usage of <code>scipy.misc</code> for dataset retrieval.</li>\n<li>A new <code>scipy.interpolate.make_smoothing_spline</code> function was added. This\nfunction constructs a smoothing cubic spline from noisy data, using the\ngeneralized cross-validation (GCV) criterion to find the tradeoff between\nsmoothness and proximity to data points.</li>\n<li><code>scipy.stats</code> has three new distributions, two new hypothesis tests, three\nnew sample statistics, a class for greater control over calculations\ninvolving covariance matrices, and many other enhancements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>New features</h1>\n<h1><code>scipy.datasets</code> introduction</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A new dedicated <code>datasets</code> submodule has been added. The submodules\nis meant for datasets that are relevant to other SciPy submodules ands\ncontent (tutorials, examples, tests), as well as contain a curated\nset of datasets that are of wider interest. As of this release, all\nthe datasets from <code>scipy.misc</code> have been added to <code>scipy.datasets</code>\n(and deprecated in <code>scipy.misc</code>).</li>\n<li>The submodule is based on <a href=\"https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/\">Pooch</a>\n(a new optional dependency for SciPy), a Python package to simplify fetching\ndata files. This move will, in a subsequent release, facilitate SciPy\nto trim down the sdist/wheel sizes, by decoupling the data files and\nmoving them out of the SciPy repository, hosting them externally and</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>SciPy 1.10.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>SciPy <code>1.10.0</code> is the culmination of <code>6</code> months of hard work. It contains\nmany new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and better\ndocumentation. There have been a number of deprecations and API changes\nin this release, which are documented below. All users are encouraged to\nupgrade to this release, as there are a large number of bug-fixes and\noptimizations. Before upgrading, we recommend that users check that\ntheir own code does not use deprecated SciPy functionality (to do so,\nrun your code with <code>python -Wd</code> and check for <code>DeprecationWarning</code> s).\nOur development attention will now shift to bug-fix releases on the\n1.10.x branch, and on adding new features on the main branch.</p>\n<p>This release requires Python <code>3.8+</code> and NumPy <code>1.19.5</code> or greater.</p>\n<p>For running on PyPy, PyPy3 <code>6.0+</code> is required.</p>\n<h1>Highlights of this release</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A new dedicated datasets submodule (<code>scipy.datasets</code>) has been added, and is\nnow preferred over usage of <code>scipy.misc</code> for dataset retrieval.</li>\n<li>A new <code>scipy.interpolate.make_smoothing_spline</code> function was added. This\nfunction constructs a smoothing cubic spline from noisy data, using the\ngeneralized cross-validation (GCV) criterion to find the tradeoff between\nsmoothness and proximity to data points.</li>\n<li><code>scipy.stats</code> has three new distributions, two new hypothesis tests, three\nnew sample statistics, a class for greater control over calculations\ninvolving covariance matrices, and many other enhancements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>New features</h1>\n<h1><code>scipy.datasets</code> introduction</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A new dedicated <code>datasets</code> submodule has been added. The submodules\nis meant for datasets that are relevant to other SciPy submodules ands\ncontent (tutorials, examples, tests), as well as contain a curated\nset of datasets that are of wider interest. As of this release, all\nthe datasets from <code>scipy.misc</code> have been added to <code>scipy.datasets</code>\n(and deprecated in <code>scipy.misc</code>).</li>\n<li>The submodule is based on <a href=\"https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/\">Pooch</a>\n(a new optional dependency for SciPy), a Python package to simplify fetching\ndata files. This move will, in a subsequent release, facilitate SciPy\nto trim down the sdist/wheel sizes, by decoupling the data files and\nmoving them out of the SciPy repository, hosting them externally and</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>SciPy 1.10.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>SciPy <code>1.10.0</code> is the culmination of <code>6</code> months of hard work. It contains\nmany new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and better\ndocumentation. There have been a number of deprecations and API changes\nin this release, which are documented below. All users are encouraged to\nupgrade to this release, as there are a large number of bug-fixes and\noptimizations. Before upgrading, we recommend that users check that\ntheir own code does not use deprecated SciPy functionality (to do so,\nrun your code with <code>python -Wd</code> and check for <code>DeprecationWarning</code> s).\nOur development attention will now shift to bug-fix releases on the\n1.10.x branch, and on adding new features on the main branch.</p>\n<p>This release requires Python <code>3.8+</code> and NumPy <code>1.19.5</code> or greater.</p>\n<p>For running on PyPy, PyPy3 <code>6.0+</code> is required.</p>\n<h1>Highlights of this release</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A new dedicated datasets submodule (<code>scipy.datasets</code>) has been added, and is\nnow preferred over usage of <code>scipy.misc</code> for dataset retrieval.</li>\n<li>A new <code>scipy.interpolate.make_smoothing_spline</code> function was added. This\nfunction constructs a smoothing cubic spline from noisy data, using the\ngeneralized cross-validation (GCV) criterion to find the tradeoff between\nsmoothness and proximity to data points.</li>\n<li><code>scipy.stats</code> has three new distributions, two new hypothesis tests, three\nnew sample statistics, a class for greater control over calculations\ninvolving covariance matrices, and many other enhancements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>New features</h1>\n<h1><code>scipy.datasets</code> introduction</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>A new dedicated <code>datasets</code> submodule has been added. The submodules\nis meant for datasets that are relevant to other SciPy submodules ands\ncontent (tutorials, examples, tests), as well as contain a curated\nset of datasets that are of wider interest. As of this release, all\nthe datasets from <code>scipy.misc</code> have been added to <code>scipy.datasets</code>\n(and deprecated in <code>scipy.misc</code>).</li>\n<li>The submodule is based on <a href=\"https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/\">Pooch</a>\n(a new optional dependency for SciPy), a Python package to simplify fetching\ndata files. This move will, in a subsequent release, facilitate SciPy\nto trim down the sdist/wheel sizes, by decoupling the data files and\nmoving them out of the SciPy repository, hosting them externally and</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

to this commit, the call to `TVMBackendFreeWorkspace` occurred outside the `LetStmt` that defined the workspace pointer.  While works with current codegen, as the code produced for `LetStmt` does not check for out-of-scope access, this access of an out-of-scope should be avoided.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the `AttrStmt` providing the storage alignment was placed outside the `LetStmt` that defines the variable. As a result, the alignment assumption is never actually used, as `CodeGenLLVM::VisitStmt_(const AttrStmtNode*)` only creates an alignment assumption for in-scope variables.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `LowerTVMBuiltin` to produce both the storage alignment `AttrStmt` and the call to `TVMBackendFreeWorkspace` inside the body of `LetStmt`, rather than outside.","created_at":"2023-07-06T13:42:18Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T13:07:55Z","closed_at":"2023-07-10T11:35:13Z","merged_at":"2023-07-10T11:35:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"30d684216c8cf0692ff5f7294050ad965541c7ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15253/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15253/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15253/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/1a0fe67e86c031885326a6e0d9f5f69513b6dc9e","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:lower_tvm_builtin_free_inside_letstmt","ref":"lower_tvm_builtin_free_inside_letstmt","sha":"1a0fe67e86c031885326a6e0d9f5f69513b6dc9e","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR improves the Decode-GEMV scheduling by further analyzing its epilogue pattern.\r\n\r\nThe existing behavior assumes that the outcome of cross-thread reduction stays in register files local to each thread, which is further used to calculate the epilogue in the same thread.\r\n\r\nThis strategy means the cross-thread reduction outcome is stored only on thread 0, while the other threads cannot participate in subsequent computation (i.e. epilogue). Related: https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15192.\r\n\r\nWhen the epilogue is relatively lightweight, i.e. elementwise add, casting on scalars, this strategy is optimal. However, once the outcome needs to be broadcasted to compute over a non-trivial region, for example, act as a normalizer of `np.mean`, it would become much slower because only one thread in a thread block is effectively used.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we will need to broadcast the cross-thread reduction outcome in shared memory, making it visible to other threads, and then bind the compute region to all threads in the threadblock.","created_at":"2023-07-06T05:45:11Z","updated_at":"2023-07-06T16:02:32Z","closed_at":"2023-07-06T16:02:32Z","merged_at":"2023-07-06T16:02:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"15a6b475bbb667bf04fb298a1ea9e31ef55814c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15252/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15252/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15252/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/bbaa988013bade5232d18df56d1c3144f4eb8265","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-07-05/epilogue-broadcast","ref":"feature/2023-07-05/epilogue-broadcast","sha":"bbaa988013bade5232d18df56d1c3144f4eb8265","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

region.","created_at":"2023-07-06T00:05:51Z","updated_at":"2023-07-07T17:29:24Z","closed_at":"2023-07-07T17:29:24Z","merged_at":"2023-07-07T17:29:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"916542ed776c151efd6fe8039232b8657b6d53e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15249/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15249/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15249/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/cf827d2b6f4bf0b9aa3968a7333c6cada95c839f","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-07-05-complete-read-write","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-07-05-complete-read-write","sha":"cf827d2b6f4bf0b9aa3968a7333c6cada95c839f","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

PR made two changes:\r\n- Replace the use of `sch.transform_block_layout` with classic\r\n  split/fuse/reorder in DecodeGEMV rule. The primitive itself is\r\n  designed to be an overkill, but in fact doesn't support symbolic\r\n  bounds really well. Meanwhile, generally it wouldn't be necessary to\r\n  use this advanced primitive as it might hurt subsequent analysis,\r\n  although in our case there isn't any.\r\n- Always make sure there is at least one spatial loop during the initial\r\n  PrimFunc normalization. This could help cases of `n -> 1` reduction\r\n  to schedule more conveniently.\r\n\r\nNOTE: `sch.transform_block_layout` is still used in the PrimFunc\r\nnormalization to remove unit loops and ensure at least one spatial loop.\r\nThere is no reorder/fusion/split happening in this specific use and\r\ncould help with all subsequent analysis to make sure all iters

PR introduces an utility pass that binds symbolic variables to user-provided integer values.\r\nFor example, say we have a following IRModule. \r\n```Python\r\n@tvm.script.ir_module\r\nclass Before:\r\n  @R.function\r\n  def main(\r\n    x: R.Tensor((\"m\", \"n\")),\r\n    y: R.Tensor((\"m\", \"n\"))\r\n   ) -> R.Tensor((\"m\", \"n\")):\r\n      m = T.Var(\"m\", \"int64\")\r\n      n = T.Var(\"m\", \"int64\")\r\n      with R.dataflow():\r\n        out = R.matmul(x, y)\r\n        R.output(out)\r\n      return out\r\n```\r\nWe can conveniently bind the symbolic variable by applying `After = relax.transform.BindSymVars(\"main\", {\"m\": 10, \"n\": 10})(Before)`.\r\n```Python\r\n@tvm.script.ir_module\r\nclass After:\r\n  @R.function\r\n  def main(\r\n    x: R.Tensor((10, 10)),\r\n    y: R.Tensor((10, 10))\r\n   ) -> R.Tensor((10, 10)):\r\n      with R.dataflow():\r\n        out = R.matmul(x, y)\r\n        R.output(out)\r\n      return out\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be useful when specializing shape and providing compile-time shape info (e.g., model params or batch sizes) by eliminating the need to rewrite the model. \r\ncc. @tqchen @psrivas2

codegen types delegate to `CodeGenCPU` for their compute kernels, as they may delegate work to packed functions.  Because `CodeGenCPU` assumes that it can return an error code at any point (e.g. when launching a parallel for loop), the compute kernel should return an error code.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves a potential bug introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15127, which removed the hard-coded override of return type.\r\n\r\nThe unit tests in this PR rely on changes made in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15239, to allow TVMScript to represent the call into a compute kernel with non-void return

draft of `T.macro` as discussed in https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/discussion-tir-macros/15247.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to introduce a decorator `T.macro` that, similarly to `T.prim_func` would annotate a piece of code as a TIR macro.  The macro would not be subject to any parameter restrictions, since the intent is to simply insert the macro's body at the place of use, substituting parameters with the actual arguments.  Since no function call is generated, no ABI constraints apply.\r\n\r\nA macro is used with a pseudo function call `T.include`, where the first argument is the macro name followed by actual arguments to the macro.\r\n\r\nFunctionally, the macro is stored as `doc.AST`, and no further processing is done on the macro definition (until it's used).\r\n\r\nIn the TIR parser, when `doc.Call` is encountered and the call is to `T.include`, this expression is treated specially:\r\n1. The definition of the macro is located.\r\n2. New variable frame is created.\r\n3. A series of assignments (parameter = argument) is evaluated.\r\n4. The macro's body is further processed by the parser.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm.script import tir as T\r\n\r\n@T.macro\r\ndef foo1(a, b, n):\r\n    with T.block(n):\r\n        a[0] = b[0]\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef bar(A: T.Buffer((2,), \"int32\"), B: T.Buffer((2,), \"int32\")):\r\n    T.include(foo1, A, B, \"block1\")\r\n\r\nprint(bar)\r\nprint(foo1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# from tvm.script import tir as T\r\n\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef main(A: T.Buffer((2,), \"int32\"), B: T.Buffer((2,), \"int32\")):\r\n    with T.block(\"block1\"):\r\n        T.reads(B[0])\r\n        T.writes(A[0])\r\n        A[0] = B[0]\r\n<tvm.script.parser.core.doc_core.Module object at 0x7fa20920de20>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`bar` has the macro expanded in its body, while `foo1` prints as `<tvm.script...Module>`.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>The detailed representation of the `foo1` macro in

PR enhances CacheRead/Write so that when a cache operation is performed under an inner block, the generated cache buffer will have the shape as compact as possible, by region consumption analysis.\r\n\r\nThe motivation of this change comes from the needs of dynamic shape TIR scheduling, in which case we may isolate a \"static shape\" internal block using blockize, and do further scheduling inside the internal block. For such cases, the current CacheRead/Write inside the static-shape block will still produce dynamic-shape cache buffers, which is not ideal for analysis and subsequent scheduling.\r\n\r\nOne thing that worths noting is that, to ensure the IR correctness after inserting the cache block, we will only compact the cache buffer when all the consumer blocks of the read buffer (for CacheRead) or the write buffer (for CacheWrite) are children blocks of the cache block insertion location. Otherwise we will insist allocating the full-size cache buffer.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Bohan Hou

PR introduces an utility pass that binds symbolic variables to user-provided integer values.\r\nFor example, say we have a following IRModule. \r\n```Python\r\n@tvm.script.ir_module\r\nclass Before:\r\n  @R.function\r\n  def main(\r\n    x: R.Tensor((\"m\", \"n\")),\r\n    y: R.Tensor((\"m\", \"n\"))\r\n   ) -> R.Tensor((\"m\", \"n\")):\r\n      m = T.Var(\"m\", \"int64\")\r\n      n = T.Var(\"m\", \"int64\")\r\n      with R.dataflow():\r\n        out = R.matmul(x, y)\r\n        R.output(out)\r\n      return out\r\n```\r\nWe can conveniently bind the symbolic variable by applying `After = relax.transform.BindSymVars(\"main\", {\"m\": 10, \"n\": 10})(Before)`.\r\n```Python\r\n@tvm.script.ir_module\r\nclass After:\r\n  @R.function\r\n  def main(\r\n    x: R.Tensor((10, 10)),\r\n    y: R.Tensor((10, 10))\r\n   ) -> R.Tensor((10, 10)):\r\n      with R.dataflow():\r\n        out = R.matmul(x, y)\r\n        R.output(out)\r\n      return out\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would be useful when specializing shape and providing compile-time shape info (e.g., model params or batch sizes) by eliminating the need to rewrite the model. \r\ncc. @tqchen @psrivas2

`PrimValue` is treated just like a tensors and `FuseOpByPattern` pass creates composite functions that have `PrimValues` as function parameters. \r\nFor example, `param_0` and `param_1` are defined to handle `PrimValues`\r\n```Python\r\n@I.ir_module\r\nclass Module:\r\n    @R.function(private=True)\r\n    def fused_relax_clip(x: R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\"), param_0: R.Prim(\"int64\"), param_1: R.Prim(\"int64\")) -> R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\"):\r\n        R.func_attr({\"Composite\": \"x.clip\", \"Primitive\": 1})\r\n        with R.dataflow():\r\n            gv: R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\") = R.clip(x, param_0, param_1)\r\n            R.output(gv)\r\n        return gv\r\n\r\n    @R.function\r\n    def main(x: R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\")) -> R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\"):\r\n        cls = Module\r\n        with R.dataflow():\r\n            gv: R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\") = cls.fused_relax_clip(x, R.prim_value(0), R.prim_value(4))\r\n            R.output(gv)\r\n        return gv\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not comply with BYOC codegens since they expect each composite function to contain these information that would have been stored in operator attribute before the adoption of `PrimValue`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR fixes `FuseOpByPattern` to include `PrimValue` inside the composite function. \r\nWith this change, the example above will have the following output.\r\n```Python\r\n@I.ir_module\r\n    class Expected1:\r\n        @R.function(private=True)\r\n        def fused_relax_clip(x: R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\")) -> R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\"):\r\n            R.func_attr({\"Composite\": \"x.clip\", \"Primitive\": 1})\r\n            with R.dataflow():\r\n                gv: R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\") = R.clip(x, R.prim_value(0), R.prim_value(4))\r\n                R.output(gv)\r\n            return gv\r\n\r\n        @R.function\r\n        def main(x: R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\")) -> R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\"):\r\n            cls = Expected1\r\n            with R.dataflow():\r\n                gv: R.Tensor((10, 10), dtype=\"float32\") = cls.fused_relax_clip(x)\r\n                R.output(gv)\r\n            return gv\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc. @masahi

proposal #14899 for TIR. Adapted from Unity PR #15171, by the same method as PR #15140. Namely, a TIR PrimFunc can be specified to be private (without a global symbol attribute) in TVMScript in the `prim_func` decorator. By default, `PrimFunc`s are not private, so they will have a `global_symbol` attribute that is mapped to their name.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```python\r\n# not private: its global symbol will be \"func\"\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(...): ...\r\n\r\n# no global symbol included\r\n@T.prim_func(private=True)\r\ndef func(...): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis did require changing very, very many tests,

cannot find a suitable way to register custom operator of ONNX in TVM. So I try to implement it.\r\n\r\nActually, it is really simple, we just need to update the convert_map which is used to convert ONNX to Relax IR.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport onnx\r\nfrom onnx import helper, TensorProto\r\nfrom tvm.relax.frontend.onnx import from_onnx\r\nfrom tvm import relax\r\nfrom tvm.relax.frontend.onnx import OnnxOpConverter\r\nfrom tvm.relax.frontend.onnx import

attr, params):\r\n        return relax.op.abs(inputs[0])\r\n\r\n\r\ndef create_custom_opset():\r\n    opset = helper.make_opsetid(op_domain, 2)\r\n\r\n    return opset\r\n\r\n\r\ndef create_custom_model():\r\n    shape = [32, 32]\r\n    node = helper.make_node(op_name, [\"x\"], [\"y\"], domain=op_domain)\r\n    graph = helper.make_graph(\r\n        [node],\r\n        \"custom_op_graph\",\r\n        inputs=[helper.make_tensor_value_info(\"x\", TensorProto.FLOAT, shape)],\r\n        outputs=[helper.make_tensor_value_info(\"y\", TensorProto.FLOAT, shape)],\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    model = helper.make_model(graph, producer_name=\"custom_op_model\")\r\n\r\n    model.opset_import.append(create_custom_opset())\r\n    return model\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ ==

PR enhance the arithmetic analysis used in compute-at to further help symbolic bound simplification.\r\n\r\nPreviously, when a variable `n` appears in the shape of an input buffer `T.Buffer((n * 32), \"float32\")`, we could safely assume that `n` is nonnegative as it is part of the shape. This could help us simplify some bounds during scheduling as well as lowering.\r\n\r\nFor example, for integers `n` and `bx` where `bx` has a symbolic bound `[0, 32 * n)`, if `n` is nonnegative, we could simplify the following expressions to True:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0 <= floordiv(bx, n) < 32\r\n0 <= floormod(bx, n) < n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on #15193 to provide an interface that hints analyzer.","created_at":"2023-07-03T03:51:22Z","updated_at":"2023-07-03T15:08:13Z","closed_at":"2023-07-03T15:08:12Z","merged_at":"2023-07-03T15:08:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"03ef29e8ad9c3073881422db3f4f935a9538370d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15210/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15210/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15210/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/17faf25f1f68703440b6e210c26a2fedef73fc18","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-07-02/compute-at-symbolic-bound","ref":"feature/2023-07-02/compute-at-symbolic-bound","sha":"17faf25f1f68703440b6e210c26a2fedef73fc18","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

PR adds a pass LiftThreadBinding to TIR.\r\n\r\nPreviously, during GPU cross-thread reduction, a temporary local buffer will be created in the RF buffer, as a concrete example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nrf_local = T.alloc_buffer(..., scope=\"local\")\r\n\r\n// Step 1. Data parallel RF block\r\nfor tx in T.thread_binding(..., thread=\"threadIdx.x\")\r\n  rf_local[tx, ...] =\r\n\r\n// Step 2. Cross-thread reduction to accumuate rf_local\r\nfor ...:\r\n  for tx' in T.thread_binding(..., thread=\"threadIdx.x\"):\r\n    ... += rf_local[tx', ...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the buffer `rf_local` will only be accessed by a single point `tx` or `tx'`, but during the pass `CompactBuffeRegion`, the two variables as thread bindings are treated as two separate variables, i.e. the information that `tx` and `tx'` are always identical to each other is discarded, which means the accessed region on `rf_local` are estimated as `Union({tx}, {tx'})` as opposed to `{tx}`, leading over allocation of local registers.\r\n\r\nThis pass is introduced to address this issue by lifting thread bindings to their LCAs.","created_at":"2023-07-02T23:44:25Z","updated_at":"2023-07-03T04:52:57Z","closed_at":"2023-07-03T04:52:56Z","merged_at":"2023-07-03T04:52:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"5931cf10eb98b628ccb719e6beed7a154faa280d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/2f936228aff6822ac03fd7f9849fc0512ce66284","head":{"label":"junrushao:feature/2023-07-02/lift-thread-binding","ref":"feature/2023-07-02/lift-thread-binding","sha":"2f936228aff6822ac03fd7f9849fc0512ce66284","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

PR enhances Decode-GEMV rule with the following changes:\r\n- Normalize the GEMV iter domain to S-R-C via transform-block-layout.\r\n  This would help with further analysis and scheduling, in cases for\r\n  example, when there was no spatial loop in the original reduction\r\n  block.\r\n- Get rid of the ad hoc iter type analysis, including the logic calling\r\n  into a TVM packed func `tir.schedule.GetLoopIterType` using\r\n  `tvm._ffi.get_global_func`.\r\n- Split out the logic for two separate cases of scheduling, where the\r\n  innermost dimension is spatial or reduction.\r\n- Introduces `suggest_threads_per_block` to guess the threads to be\r\n  allocated each threadblock. This helps avoid the previous case where\r\n  dlight allocates 256 threads for a workload whose degree of parallelism\r\n  is only 128.\r\n- Misc improvements.\r\n\r\nThis rest of the changes are split out to separate PRs that are already\r\nmerged to main.\r\n- [x] Pass the hints to arithmetic analyzer that shape variables should\r\nbe positive ones (https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15210)\r\n- [x] Eliminate unnecessary block predicate generation - should be\r\nprovable via affine analysis (https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15193)\r\n- [x] Shrink local memory allocation if only one element `X[threadIdx.x]`\r\nis used
