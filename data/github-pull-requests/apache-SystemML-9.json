commit remove the late sort of the bitmap, that unfortunately reallocated the bitmap multiple times.\r\nThis is fixed by sorting the bitmap at creation time instead.\r\n\r\nWhile making this fix the Bitmap have been isolated in its own package and the interface to create such a map is reduced to one function.\r\nAlso contained in this PR is fixes to construction of SDC groups to better exploit the common value construction in the shortcut

PR introduces the Federated Lookup Table as a first step for supporting Federated Multi Tenancy.\r\nThe Federated Lookup Table maps a Coordinator Identifier (FedUniqueCoordID) to an individual ExecutionContextMap at the Federated Worker. Each Federated Worker creates a FederatedLookupTable, and selects the corresponding ExecutionContextMap per FederatedRequest depending on the coordinator host (obtained from the netty channel) and the pid added to the FederatedRequest. Therefore, it allows the local sequential variable ID creation at the coordinator without collisions with any other coordinators, since every different coordinator has its own ExecutionContextMap.\r\nI also added some shell scripts to test the Setup with multiple coordinators locally, although I will most likely change the tests again in a later PR, since I'm not happy with them myself. :D\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR adds a few checks to the primitve function tests to ensure that the output is federated.\r\nI always verified it by simply adding an additional instruction (uak+) - which is then executed federated - and checking that the heavy hitters contain this specific federated instruction (fed_uak+).\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR adds the first federated performance test, ALS-CG.\r\nThe script generates the data, creates a specific amount (in our case 5) of federated worker processes on localhost, splits the data into partitions, creates a federated object from the different partitions and workers, runs the ALS-CG algorithm with the federated object as data input, and kills the woker processes again.\r\nI tried to make the shell scripts for starting and killing the federated workers, and also the dml script for splitting the data and creating a federated object, as general as possible so that the same scripts can be used the further federated performance tests.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR introduces the Transformable Interface which defines the needed functions for the Encoders. It is implemented by the `MatrixBlock` and `FrameBlock`. Due to the Interface, a lot of redundant code was removed and a single code path for Multi- and Singlethreaded operations was established, this makes the code a lot easier to navigate and read.\r\nThere is still redundant code in form of the SparseApply Tasks in each encoder, they can be removed in the future but at the moment they serve the purpose of easier debugging. \r\nFurthermore, the handling of missing values was reworked for all encoders.","created_at":"2021-09-30T10:48:46Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T07:18:02Z","closed_at":"2021-10-21T22:07:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"346b2bd5f26afe023efffd3df7a8fe0f12d9175d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1405/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1405/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1405/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/770103e973f37d202fc2a097cd64d3b80bc328bd","head":{"label":"ilovemesomeramen:master","ref":"master","sha":"770103e973f37d202fc2a097cd64d3b80bc328bd","user":{"login":"ilovemesomeramen","id":8418379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTgzNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen","html_url":"https://github.com/ilovemesomeramen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":341013299,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDEwMTMyOTk=","name":"systemds","full_name":"ilovemesomeramen/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ilovemesomeramen","id":8418379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTgzNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8418379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen","html_url":"https://github.com/ilovemesomeramen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilovemesomeramen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ilovemesomeramen/systemds","description":"Mirror

PR contains a small fix for the MV case to keep the output federated. The problem was that the branch to create a federated output was only taken if it was forced federated. I have now changed it so that the partial output is only set if it is forced federated, and the federated output is set if it is not forced local.\r\nThe other changes inside AggregateBinaryFEDInstruction should not change the functional behaviour of the instruction. I only tried to cleanup some code redundancies that could be merged.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an implicit change to the FederatedTokenizeTest, where I removed the creation of the fourth thread because it is never used.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR adds support for keeping the output of the ctable instruction federated whenever it is possible. Previously, the partial outputs were always pulled to the coordinator.\r\nSince there were some assumptions that the federated partitions would be the same size, I rewrote some methods.\r\nI also added a testcase to test the creation of the federated output using matrices as input instead of just vectors.\r\n\r\nPlease have a close look at it :monocle_face: \r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR adds a Framework for dependent Task execution consisting of the `DependencyTask` and `DependencyThreadPool` as well as the implementation of build and apply in said Framework.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now possible for different encoders to provide tasks which best fit the given data characteristics by overriding the `getApplyTasks` and `getBuildTasks` functions. These functions can return a DAG of Tasks which will be integrated into the DAG of the whole Matrix/Frame. Subsequently this DAG is then executed in the `DependencyThreadPool`. This approach enables the possibility of trying different execution orders without the need to make major changes to the code.\r\n\r\nAt the moment only the Dummycoders implement a different apply method compared to the default. This will be changed in future PRs.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are two approaches implemented staged and non staged.\r\nDuring staged execution the building and applying steps take place one after another. Which means the building will be done for the whole Matrix/Frame and then the apply takes place.\r\nNon staged execution on the other hand constructs one large DAG for building and applying.

PR adds support for federated *quaternary* instructions with multiple *aligned* federated matrices.\r\nI also changed the tests so that we are testing the different possibilities of alignments.\r\n\r\nI commented out the test _federatedWeightedUnaryMatrixMultPow2Spark_ because it is producing _NaNs_, and hence it is failing. I haven't found the reason for this yet, but somehow it depends on the sparsity of the input matrix.\r\n\r\nThanks for review
