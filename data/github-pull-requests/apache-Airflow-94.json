cassandra hack added in #30315 does not seem to have a chance to get away. Neither Pytest https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10844 nor Datastax https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/pull/1142 want to own the problem for now (though there is a proposal from pytest contributors on how Datastax could refactor their code to avoid the problem)\r\n\r\nHowever during the discussion an idea popped in my head on how we could come back to test_* pattern with far less probability of missing some tests that are added to wrong files. Seems that we can add a fixture that will outright fail tests if they are placed if files not following the test_* pattern. While it would not help in case test would be wrongly named in the first place, it would definitely help to not to add more tests in wrongly named files because it will be literally impossible to run the tests added in a wrong file, even if you manualy do `pytest somefile.py` and avoid running collection.\r\n\r\nI also did a quick check to try to find cases where the test_* file name was already violated and I found (and renamed) two that I have found. It seems it is quite likely that similar mistake could be done in the future - but with the fixture I added it should be far less likely someone adds tests in a wrongly named file.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

problem**: `joinedload` on `TaskInstance.dag_run` is generally not needed except for UI/API (list all task instances and related fields at once), but the unnecessary `JOIN` is a killer of Airflow scheduling performance especially when there are thousands of task instances in single DagRun.\r\n\r\n**The real problem in some large scale Airflow clusters**: \r\nWe manage thousands of airflow executors (nodes) in production, and each DagRun may have 10k task instances. \r\n\r\n* In Scheduler side , the impact is very obvious as after making it lazy, we do see 3+ times scheduling performance improvement. \r\n\r\n* In Executor side, when tasks are queued and preparing to execute, it will check if dependencies meet with all finished task instances, a large amount of concurrent JOIN SQL will slow database performance. Especially when the config content size of some DagRun is large (1MB), thousands of concurrent executors will pull the same large DagRun at same time and it will also cause huge network throughput (~1 GB/second) from database and make the centralized database and the whole airflow cluster unhealthy. \r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

lot of work has been done to optimize load time of the Executor modules so that they can be included in the CLI code path (so that executors can vend cli commands, part of AIP-51, see [this PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29055)). It has come up several times to add a test to assert the CLI runtime does not regress, while working on this code recently I found one such regression (OTEL related, not yet present in main, which I will fix in another PR) so I was motivated to add one. I played around with several options, but none captured the full extent of any delays/regressions beyond actually calling the airflow CLI in a subprocess call, which is what this unit test does.\r\n\r\nTiming related tests are often troublesome because they can be flaky if, for example, they are run on an env that is bogged down/slow they may breach their assertions. But if we give a large enough (but still reasonable) threshold, I think we'll get more benefit than harm. But I'm curious to hear what others think.\r\n\r\nCC: @potiuk

changes implemented:\r\n\r\n* provider.yaml files for providers can optionally contribute extra\r\n  configuration, the configuration is exposed via \"get_provider_info\"\r\n  entrypoint, thus allowing Airflow to discover the configuration\r\n  from both - sources (in Breeze and local development) and from\r\n  installed packages\r\n\r\n* Provider configuraitions are lazily loaded - only for commands that\r\n  actually need them\r\n\r\n* Documentation for configuration contributed by providers is\r\n  generated as part of Provider documentation. It is also discoverable\r\n  by having a \"core-extension\" page displaying all community providers\r\n  that contribute their own configuration.\r\n\r\n* Celery configuration (and in the future Kubernetes configuration) is\r\n  linked directly from the airflow documentation - the providers are\r\n  preinstalled, which means that celery (and Kubernetes in the future)\r\n  configuration is considered as important to be directly mentioned\r\n  and linked from the core. Similarly Celery and Kubernetes executor\r\n  documentation remains in the core documentation (still configuration\r\n  options are detailed only in the provider documentation and only\r\n  linked from the core.\r\n\r\n* configuration writing happens in \"main\" not in the configuration\r\n  initialization and we will always execute provider configuration\r\n  initialization. This will make sure that the generated configuration\r\n  will contain configuration for the providers as well.\r\n\r\n* Related documentation about custom and community providers have been\r\n  updated and somewhat refactored - I realized that some of it was quite\r\n  out-of-date and some of it was really \"developer\" not user docs.\r\n  The docs are restructured a bit, cleaned, missing

#29602 as it seems a bit abandoned 🏚️ \r\n\r\nmy changes:\r\n - merged recent main\r\n - removed try/except that created a special case for tests (pointed by @uranusjr in a comment on the original PR)\r\n - (more descriptive title)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Original description:\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default value for configure scheduler.max_tis_per_query to 16 and update related document.\r\n\r\nBefore this change scheduler.max_tis_per_query=512 by default.\r\n\r\nscheduler.max_tis_per_query should not be greater than core.parallelism according to related code [[1]](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/49867b660b6231c1319969217bc61917f7cf9829/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L581) and [[2]](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/49867b660b6231c1319969217bc61917f7cf9829/airflow/executors/base_executor.py#L331). If both configurations use default value, the default 512 of max_tis_per_query is never used.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, default will set scheduler.max_tis_per_query=16 and core.parallelism=32. This will make the executor can be populated in two iteration of scheduler main loop.\r\n\r\nThe actual change applied in Airflow runtime by this PR is to reduce the max_tis from 32 to 16. The query batch size reduced. This can help scheduler finish the iteration faster. Thus make scheduler more responsive and healthy.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updated related document about scheduler.max_tis_per_query to help users understand how to set this configuration.","created_at":"2023-07-12T22:09:23Z","updated_at":"2024-01-04T19:34:41Z","closed_at":"2023-07-20T20:29:20Z","merged_at":"2023-07-20T20:29:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"15d42b4320d535cf54743929f134e36f59c615bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

change is quite simple in that it allows helm templates to be used in the value of `cleanup.schedule`. This also works with strings, which makes the change backwards compatible, so it will have no impact on existing installations. Shout out to @jedcunningham and @dstandish for helping me settle on this very simple syntax change.\r\n\r\nThere were no tests for `cleanup.schedule`, so I added tests, including tests for using strings and for using helm template logic.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the test logic shows an example of using adler32sum to select a deterministic random-ish number, seeded by `.Release.Name`, to use as the starting minute for the cleanup cronjob. This mechanism will avoid starting all cleanup jobs across all deployments on minute 0, and was the impetus for changing from string to a template.","created_at":"2023-07-12T21:00:15Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T08:06:30Z","closed_at":"2023-07-12T22:53:37Z","merged_at":"2023-07-12T22:53:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae29225ff54e8f3bc4fa6934c59b84852c93c713","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1971984525,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTcxOTg0NTI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:helm-chart","name":"area:helm-chart","color":"024e91","default":false,"description":"Airflow

And when it returns a falsy object like an empty dict, we evaluate it as a False and we skip the downstream tasks, but we return nothing, which is similar to return `None`.\r\n\r\nThis returned `None` raise an exception when we use the decorator with `multiple_outputs=True`, the only way to skip the downstream tasks is returning an empty dict, but the returned `None` brakes the post-processing method which push the returned Xcom.

had two types of documentation building:\r\n * latest\r\n * for production\r\n\r\nBut in fact they never overlapped and we were never mixing the two We used the latest for all development work and for production for releasing to \"airflow.apache.org\".\r\n\r\nHowever as we saw in #32562 (triggered by #32495 changing the build in main to run with `--for-production` flag - we actually do not need the \"latest\" builds at all. Everything can be build with \"for production\" by default.\r\n\r\nThis change removes the `--for-production` flag entirely, leaving the \"for production\" build mode as the only one available.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#32495 changed the way to run docs - with using --for-production flag, which means that the docs are generated under \"stable\" link rather than \"latest\" - in order to test document publishing.\r\n\r\nWe could change it back to latest, but the problem revealed that we do not have to actually make a distinction there. It's ok to keep it all as \"stable\" - no problem with that - there is no distinction between latest and stable other than different link and we never mix the two (our production docs have only stable), so it's ok to switch everything to stable.\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up `--for-production` flag will be removed and we will switch everything to stable for all documentation building. For now fetching docs from stable link should fix the problem.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

release commands in Breeze were somewhat disorganized, some of them were hidden from the output of release-management command, and they were connected to release-management group in a bit weird way.\r\n\r\nThey also did not have a chapter in BREEZE documentation\r\n\r\nThis PR makes all the release management commands more consistently explained in documentation and help file:\r\n\r\n* the list of release-management commands contains all of the commands\r\n* they commands are grouped together in logical groups (Airflow, providers, other)\r\n* they are all linked to the common release_management group via the same mechanism (``@release_management.command``)\r\n* screenshots are generated for all of the commands and described in BREEZE.rst\r\n* the structure of documentation in BREEZE.rst reflects the logical grouping of commands\r\n* references are added between BREEZE.rst and relase READMES when needed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)

circuit operator should by default not skip teardowns for which the object task is in scope.\r\n\r\nSo for example if you have `s1 >> w1 >> w2 >> t1` and t1 is teardown for s1, then if w1 is short circuit, w2 should be skipped but not t1.\r\n\r\nA more interesting scenario is \r\n```\r\ns1 >> op1 >> s2 >> op2 >> [t1, t2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n```\r\ns1 >> op1 >> s2 >> op2 >> t2 >> t1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both of these cases, if op1 is short circuit (and s1 >> t1, s2 >> t2), then tasks `s2, op2, t2` should all be skipped but t1 should not! BUT... importantly, we don't need to do the skipping for t2 in short circuit operator.  This will be handled automatically by the scheduler when applying the trigger rules (if the setup was skipped, the teardown will be skipped).  Handling it here would be more complexity and duplication of logic than we need.  Particularly in weirder examples like `s1 >> w1 >> t1, w2 >> t1` where w2 is short circuit.\r\n\r\n@vatsrahul1001\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-12T00:39:44Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T18:29:45Z","closed_at":"2023-07-14T00:52:28Z","merged_at":"2023-07-14T00:52:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb5307850d93df16f442bfce2f388c90d63c6f9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

current security manager is highly dependent on FAB (Flask App Builder). One of the goal of AIP-56 is to move these FAB related operations to the auth manager. This PR adds capability for the auth manager to override the security manager. As such, overtime and multiple iteration/PRs we can move slowly operations/methods which are in the security manager to the security manager override defined in the auth manager module.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves `register_views` and few other small methods from core Airflow to the auth manager module. Again, the goal is to move by iterations things from the security manager (in core Airflow) to the auth manager module.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

far, only list of flags and their details have been used to determine if the screenshots of Breeze commands should be regenerated (by calculating hash of those options). However also rich-click options determine the look of those screenshots (by grouping options together) so change in the options should also be included in hash generation.\r\n\r\nThis change combines the dict of click options for each command with the rich-click options into a single dictionary and hashes them together - this way any time any of those parameters change, the image will need to be regenerated.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

mentioned in #32177.\r\n\r\n* Move some imports to type-checking block to avoid runtime cost\r\n* Use `SELECT 1` to avoid loading ORM model objects unnecessarily\r\n* Use `scalars(...)` to avoid needing to unpack ORM models\r\n* Use `table.c[key]` instead of getattr(table.c, key). They work basically the same, except getattr is worse for this purpose (potential name conflicts)\r\n* Use generators when the arguments are immediately unpacked into a function call so there's no

is a follow-up after #32494 and #32463, where autodetection of docker context has been added. There is a weird relation between builders and docker context - sometimes they have to be used in sync, and sometimes not. For example when we are creating a new context manually (airxflow_cache) to build images in parallel on ARM/x86, we should use airflow_cache as buider, but the context should remain \"default\". On the other hand when we are using \"desktop-linux\" builder, we MUST switch the context to \"desktop-linux\".\r\n\r\nThis PR is an attempt to make best effort to switch to the same context as the builder, but instead of failing, we just warn if can't and continue.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

`BigQueryGetDataOperator`'s `project_id` parameter is currently being used to specify table's storage project, but also used for job submissions in deferred mode. This PR aims to separate these responsibilities by introducing two new parameters:\r\n* `table_project_id` to specify the table's storage project.\r\n* `job_project_id` to specify job submission project to fetch data from the table.\r\n\r\nBoth parameters are optional, and are defaulted by hook's project_id.\r\n\r\nThe pre-existing `project_id` parameter is deprecated, with log warnings on usage.\r\n\r\nrelated: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/32093\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
