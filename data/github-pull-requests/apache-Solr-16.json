I think I found the reason it was failing, opening another PR for validation.\r\n\r\nI think failures were due to extra fallback to getUser() on the onBegin -> generateToken. this should not happen as everything was already setup when the `onQueued` method was called.\r\n\r\nI used the failure seed as a starting point, and now it passes\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew test --tests JWTAuthPluginIntegrationTest.testMetrics -Dtests.seed=8938961115F4C519 -Dtests.multiplier=3 -Dtests.locale=tr-TR -Dtests.timezone=Pacific/Niue -Dtests.asserts=true -Dtests.file.encoding=UTF-8\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the approach taken to implement your solution.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests you've developed or run to confirm this patch implements the feature or solves the problem.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch.

you are a project committer then you may remove some/all of the following template.)_\r\n\r\nBefore creating a pull request, please file an issue in the ASF Jira system for Solr:\r\n\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SOLR\r\n\r\nFor something minor (i.e. that wouldn't be worth putting in release notes), you can skip JIRA. \r\nTo create a Jira issue, you will need to create an account there first.\r\n\r\nThe title of the PR should reference the Jira issue number in the form:\r\n\r\n* SOLR-####: <short description of problem or changes>\r\n\r\nSOLR must be fully capitalized. A short description helps people scanning pull requests for items they can work on.\r\n\r\nProperly referencing the issue in the title ensures that Jira is correctly updated with code review comments and commits. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nWhile persisting the ManagedIndexSchema as XML, non-printable characters in field names get escaped as #nn;, where nn is the decimal representation of the non-printable character. For example, if the field name has the byte 0x14, it gets escaped as #20;. This in indistinguishable from the literal #20; in the field name. If we have two fields - one with the non-printable character and the other with the literal string, two fields get generated with the same name. Loading the resulting XML, naturally, causes an exception. To fix this, any occurrence of literal # in the field name should be escaped, with say ##.\r\nA second problem is that while escaping happens when generating XML, the corresponding unescaping does not happen on loading it.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nBoth the suggested fixes are here. There are tests to expose the bugs and the fixes that pass the tests.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nAdded two sets of tests - one for IndexSchema.java and the other for XML.java\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch.

if you setup a copy field with a * source and a DenseVectorField is present in the schema indexing will fail unless the destination is a DenseVectorField. I think the better behavior is to skip the DenseVectorField during the copy. If we don't do this the * copyfield is simply broken with a DenseVectorField in the index.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves the issue while preserving the exception in the cases where the copyField source is not *. The PR skips adding the DenseVectorField to a destination field of a different type if the source for the copyField is *.\r\n\r\nA * source copyField was added to an existing DenseVectorField test schema, which passes. An existing test (org.apache.solr.update.DocumentBuilderTest.denseVector_incorrectCopyFieldDestinationType_shouldThrowException)  passes, which proves non * source copyFields still throw an exception

https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SOLR\r\n\r\nFor something minor (i.e. that wouldn't be worth putting in release notes), you can skip JIRA. \r\nTo create a Jira issue, you will need to create an account there first.\r\n\r\nThe title of the PR should reference the Jira issue number in the form:\r\n\r\n* SOLR-####: <short description of problem or changes>\r\n\r\nSOLR must be fully capitalized. A short description helps people scanning pull requests for items they can work on.\r\n\r\nProperly referencing the issue in the title ensures that Jira is correctly updated with code review comments and commits. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nIn SolrJ, the `_route_` parameter is taken into account to find a node with a replica for the collection, but the query is send to the collection (without specifying any core). The node will then pick-up a random local core for the collection, that is not necessarily scoped by the query.\r\nSearch works because the request is forwarded to the correct shards, but we may avoid one redirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nWhen querying a single collection and the `_route_` parameter is specified, send the query to a replica of this collection.\r\nNo change if querying more than one collection.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nAdded `CloudSolrClientRoutingTest`, adapted from Jason Baik's patch in the Jira ticket.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch. (optional but recommended)\r\n- [x] I have developed this patch against the `main` branch.\r\n- [x] I have run `./gradlew check`.\r\n- [x] I have added tests for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have added

you are a project committer then you may remove some/all of the following template.)_\r\n\r\nBefore creating a pull request, please file an issue in the ASF Jira system for Solr:\r\n\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SOLR\r\n\r\nFor something minor (i.e. that wouldn't be worth putting in release notes), you can skip JIRA. \r\nTo create a Jira issue, you will need to create an account there first.\r\n\r\nThe title of the PR should reference the Jira issue number in the form:\r\n\r\n* SOLR-####: <short description of problem or changes>\r\n\r\nSOLR must be fully capitalized. A short description helps people scanning pull requests for items they can work on.\r\n\r\nProperly referencing the issue in the title ensures that Jira is correctly updated with code review comments and commits. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nbin/solr -f was a way to start solr, which made sense when bin/solr was only a script to start solr. These days, there are many commands under the bin/solr, so lets make life simpler by making ti clear you have to say bin/solr start if you want to start solr.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nAs discussed in the jira comments we would go with the explicit start command from Solr 10 and leave the implicit start command for the Solr 9 line.\r\nI have removed the implicit start command and made some modifications in order to still handle incorrect inputs correctly. \r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests you've developed or run to confirm this patch implements the feature or solves the problem.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch. (optional but recommended)\r\n- [x] I have developed this patch against the `main` branch.\r\n- [x] I have run `./gradlew check`.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have added

Description\r\n\r\nSolr has slowly been modifying its v2 APIs to align around a more REST-ful model.  Many APIs have already been through this re-alignment but many more remain including backup-listing and deletion.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nThis commit tweaks the list-backups and delete-backups v2 APIs to be more REST-ful.  The APIs are now:\r\n\r\n- List Backups - `GET /api/backups/bName/versions`\r\n- Delete Backup By ID - `DELETE /api/backups/bName/versions/123`\r\n- Delete Backups By Recency - `DELETE /api/backups/bName/versions?retainLatest=3`\r\n- Garbage Collect Orphaned - `PUT /api/backups/bName/purgeUnused`\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nExisting backup/restore tests continue to pass.  Additional tests added in `DeleteCollectionBackupAPITest`.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch.

: \r\n- V2 Implematation ?\r\n- Question (from @gerlowskija) : Are the calculations based on size-estimator-lucene-solr.xls accurate enough to use?\r\n- Suggestion (from @dsmiley) : Has the Metrics API been explored as a solution to the problem/need?\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nNew feature that attempts to extrapolate resources needed in the future by looking at resources currently used.\r\n\r\nOriginal idea by Steve Molloy, with additional parameter based on comment from Shawn Heisey.\r\n\r\nDocumentation copied from the Jira ticket.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nV1 API:\r\nNew component: SizeComponent.java.  Component can be set on the /select handler to provide sizing for a single core.\r\n\r\nNew collection operation: ClusterSizing.java.  Action 'clustersizing' is added to CollectionsHandler.  Class ClusterSizing calls the size component for each core.\r\n\r\nOld-style V2 API:\r\nAdding a method in ClusterApi.java.  It calls the V1 implementation, so the question of accuracy remains\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nThe size component is tested in SizeComponentTest.java\r\n\r\nCluster sizing response is tested in ClusterSizingTest.java\r\n\r\nFull test on a running instance of Solr.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SOLR\r\n\r\nFor something minor (i.e. that wouldn't be worth putting in release notes), you can skip JIRA. \r\nTo create a Jira issue, you will need to create an account there first.\r\n\r\nThe title of the PR should reference the Jira issue number in the form:\r\n\r\n* SOLR-####: <short description of problem or changes>\r\n\r\nSOLR must be fully

A short description helps people scanning pull requests for items they can work on.\r\n\r\nProperly referencing the issue in the title ensures that Jira is correctly updated with code review comments and commits. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nNowhere do we mention `-usage` as a parameter, and it's not one that I ever use. `-help` is common, as is `-h`, so make sure that works everywhere. There are places where `-h` doesn't work!\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nDeleted appearances of `-usage` and added `-h` where it was not present.

Description\r\n\r\nStack traces are considered a security risk.  Please refer to OWASP for a full explanation:\r\n\r\nhttps://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/\r\n\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nAdd a property \"hideStackTrace\" to solr.xml.  In NodeConfig, the default value is \"false\", for back-compatibility.\r\n\r\nUse the new property in ResponseUtils, to print out, or not, the stack trace.\r\n\r\nAdapt code that calls ResponseUtils.\r\n\r\nAlso check if stack traces should be hidden everywhere the \"trace\" element is added to a response.  (I searched for the string\"trace\" - with quotes - throughout the Solr code.  Hope I got everything.)\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\norg.apache.solr.servlet.HideStackTraceTest : force an exception into the response, and assert that if hideStackTrace=true, the stack trace is not shown.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch.

On this Gradle Enterprise instance, Apache Solr will have access not only to all of the published build scans but other aggregate data features such as:\r\n\r\nDashboards to view all historical build scans, along with performance trends over time\r\nBuild failure analytics for enhanced investigation and diagnosis of build failures\r\nTest failure analytics to better understand trends and causes around slow, failing, and flaky tests\r\nIf interested in exploring a fully populated Gradle Enterprise instance, please explore the builds already connected to [ge.apache.org](https://ge.apache.org/), the [Spring project’s instance](https://ge.spring.io/scans?search.relativeStartTime=P28D&search.timeZoneId=Europe/Zurich), or any number of other [OSS projects](https://gradle.com/enterprise-customers/oss-projects/) for which we sponsor instances of Gradle Enterprise.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any questions about the value of Gradle Enterprise or the changes in this pull request and I’d be happy to address them.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nN/A - This PR is a Gradle build enhancement\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nN/A - This PR does not affect functional code in the project\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [ ] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch. (optional but recommended)\r\n- [x] I have developed this patch against the `main` branch.\r\n- [x] I have run `./gradlew check`.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have added

https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SOLR\r\n\r\nFor something minor (i.e. that wouldn't be worth putting in release notes), you can skip JIRA. \r\nTo create a Jira issue, you will need to create

A short description helps people scanning pull requests for items they can work on.\r\n\r\nProperly referencing the issue in the title ensures that Jira is correctly updated with code review comments and commits. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nCreate a V2 equivalent API for the replication \"GET indexversion\"\r\n\r\nV1\r\n`/solr/{coreName}/replication?command=indexversion`\r\n\r\nV2\r\n`/api/core/{coreName}/replication/indexversion`\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nCreated a new CoreReplicationAPI class using JAS-RX framework exposing the new V2 endpoint.

[`v5.0.0`](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v5.0.0)\n\n### Mockito 5: prepare for future JDK versions\n\nFor a while now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.\n\n#### Switch the default mockmaker to `mockito-inline`\n\nBack in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the \"inline bytecode\" principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates \"real\" subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.\n\nMassive thanks to community member [@&#8203;reta](https://togithub.com/reta) who implemented this change.\n\nNote: this does not affect `mockito-android` nor testing on Android.\n\n##### When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?\n\nThere are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.\nFor example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.\nNote however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.\nWe want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.\n\nIf you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new `mockito-subclass` artifact (published [on Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass) along with all our other artifacts).\n\n#### Update the minimum supported Java version to 11\n\nMockito 4 supports Java 8 and above.\nSimilar to other open source projects, we are moving away from JDK 8 and to newer versions.\nThe primary reason for moving away from JDK 8 is the increasing maintenance costs with keeping our own infrastructure working.\nLately we have been running into more and more JDK 8 breakages.\nAdditionally, while we want to support the newest JDK API's, our current solution to support both JDK 8 and newer versions causes [issues with the `SecurityManager`](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2798).\nSince we want Mockito to work on the newest version and more and more businesses adopting JDK 11, we have decided to make the switch as well.\n\nMassive thanks to community member [@&#8203;reta](https://togithub.com/reta) who implemented this change.\n\n##### What should I do if I still run JDK 8?\n\nFor JDK 8 and below, you can keep on using Mockito 4.\nThis is similar to if you are using JDK 6, for which you can keep on using Mockito 2.\nThe changes in Mockito 5 (for now) are primarily focused on the latest JDK versions, which means the API differences between Mockito 4 and 5 are minimal.\nHowever, over time this will most likely widen, so we do recommend adopting JDK 11 in the future.\n\n#### New `type()` method on `ArgumentMatcher`\n\nOne of our most used public API's for customizing Mockito is the [`ArgumentMatcher` interface](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/ArgumentMatcher.html).\nThe interface allows you to define a custom matcher, which you can pass into method arguments to provide more targeted matches.\nOne major shortcoming of the `ArgumentMatcher` was the lack of varargs support.\nThere were many, many issues filed related to varargs and Mockito unable to handle them.\n\nCommunity member [@&#8203;big-andy-coates](https://togithub.com/big-andy-coates) put in a lot of effort to come up with an appropriate solution, including fully implementing and comparing 2 approaches.\nUltimately, we decided that introducing a new `type()` method on `ArgumentMatcher` is the best solution.\nAs a result, it is now possible to update your custom matchers to implement varargs support, if you so desire.\nNote that `ArgumentMatcher` is still a `@FunctionalInterface` and can therefore still be written as a lambda.\n\nMassive thanks to community member [@&#8203;big-andy-coates](https://togithub.com/big-andy-coates) who implemented this change.\n\n##### What is the effect of this new method?\n\nFor varargs methods, there was previously a way to only match zero arguments, or two or more arguments, by using the exact number of matchers, i.e.\n\n```java\nlong call(String... args);\n\n// Will match calls with exactly zero arguments:\nwhen(mock.call()).thenReturn(0L);\n\n// Will match calls with exactly two arguments:\nwhen(mock.call(any(), any())).thenReturn(0L);\n```\n\nBut following the pattern to match exactly one argument:\n\n```java\nwhen(mock.call(any())).thenReturn(0L);\n```\n\ndoesn't work, as `any` is \"vararg aware\", so Mockito matched the `any` against *each element* of the varargs parameter, meaning it will match any number of arguments, i.e. the above would of matched all of these:\n\n```java\nmock.call();\nmock.call(\"a\");\nmock.call(\"a\", \"b\");\n```\n\nWith the new `type` method, it's now possible to differentiate matching calls with any exact number of arguments, or to match any number of arguments.\n\n```java\n// Match any number of arguments:\nwhen(mock.call(any(String[].class))).thenReturn(1L);\n// Match invocations with no arguments:\nwhen(mock.call()).thenReturn(1L);\n// Match invocations with exactly one argument:\nwhen(mock.call(any())).thenReturn(1L);\n// Alternative to match invocations with exactly one argument:\nwhen(mock.call(any(String.class))).thenReturn(1L);\n// Match invocations with exactly two arguments:\nwhen(mock.call(any(), any())).thenReturn(1L);\n```\n\nTherefore, if you want to match 0 or more arguments, use `any(String[].class)`.\nIf you want to match an exact number of arguments, use `any(String.class)` (and specify as many `any` matchers as arguments you want to match on).\n\nIn a similar fashion, the behavior of `ArgumentCaptor.forClass` has changed as well.\nIf you want to capture all arguments, use an `ArgumentCaptor` for `String[]`, otherwise `String`:\n\n```java\n// Will capture 1 string\n@&#8203;Captor private ArgumentCaptor<String> captor;\n// Will capture all strings\n@&#8203;Captor private ArgumentCaptor<String[]> captor;\n```\n\nFor more information, see the description and conversation in [pull request 2835](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2835) and [pull request 2807](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/pull/2807).\n\nAt the same time, `ArgumentCaptor` is now fully type-aware.\nThis allows for capturing specific subclasses on a generic method:\n\n```java\n// Given:\nint simpleMethod(Collection<?> arg);\n\n// When:\nmock.simpleMethod(Set.of());\nmock.simpleMethod(List.of());\n\n// Then:\nArgumentCaptor<Collection<?>> captor = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(List.class);\nverify(mock).simpleMethod(captor.capture());\nassertThat(captor.getAllValues()).containsExactly(List.of());\n```\n\n##### Do I need to implement this new method?\n\nNo, you don't need to.\nMockito 5 declares a default implementation, returning `Void.type` as the type of an `ArgumentMatcher`.\nThis essentially means that Mockito will not consider the type when handling varargs.\nHowever, if you do return a specific type, Mockito will consider this when matching arguments.\nAs a result, this new method is not a source-breaking change, but is a bytecode-breaking change.\nAll code working on Mockito 4 should work as-is when recompiled with Mockito 5.\n\n###

Users should instead use\n    `org.mockito.junit.MockitoJUnitRunner` which is our official JUnit4\n    runner.\n\n### [`v3.12.4`](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/releases/tag/v3.12.4)\n\n<sup><sup>*Changelog generated by [Shipkit Changelog Gradle Plugin](https://togithub.com/shipkit/shipkit-changelog)*</sup></sup>\n\n##### 3.12.4\n\n-   2021-08-25 - [1 commit(s)](https://togithub.com/mockito/mockito/compare/v3.12.3...v3.12.4) by Rafael Winterhalter\n-   No notable improvements.

Some APIs have already been converted, but many remain: including the APIs for replica and shard deletion.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR migrates the v2 delete-replica and delete-shard APIs over to JAX-RS.  No user-visible changes were made to the v2 delete-shard endpoint.  Delete-replica however has been split into two separate endpoints (one to delete a single named replica, and one to delete a specified number of (unnamed) replicas.  The v2 APIs now appear as below:\r\n\r\n- \"Delete shard\" - `DELETE /api/collections/collName/shards/shardName` (no changes)\r\n- \"Delete named replica\" - `DELETE /api/collections/collName/shards/shardName/replicas/replicaName`\r\n- \"Delete multiple replicas from specific shard\" - `DELETE /api/collections/collName/shards/shardName/replicas?count=3`\r\n- \"Delete multiple replicas from all shards\" - `PUT /api/collections/collName/scale {\"count\": 3}`\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nSee `DeleteReplicaAPITest` and `DeleteShardAPITest`\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch.

Description\r\n\r\nSolr is currently making slow progress in moving its v2 APIs in a more REST-ful direction. Many APIs have been improved, but many remaining including the API to restore to a new or existing collection.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nThis commit makes various cosmetic improvements to Solr's v2 restore-collection API, to bring it more into line with the more REST-ful v2 design. This mostly consists of moving the API under the /api/backups/backupName/restore path, and removing the top-level \"command\" specification from the request body.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nExisting tests continue to pass. New unit tests in RestoreCollectionAPITest.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch.

Description\r\n\r\nSolr is currently making slow progress in moving its v2 APIs in a more REST-ful direction. Many APIs have been improved, but many remaining including the commonly used API to create aliases.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nThis commit makes various cosmetic improvements to Solr's v2 create alias API, to bring it more into line with the more REST-ful v2 design. This mostly includes moving the API to the new `/api/aliases` path, and restructuring the v2 request body to be a bit more intuitive.  An example request now looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /api/aliases\r\n  {\r\n      \"name\": \"somethingTemporalThisWayComes\",\r\n      \"routers\" : [\r\n        {\r\n          \"type\": \"time\",\r\n          \"field\": \"evt_dt\",\r\n          \"start\":\"NOW/MINUTE\",\r\n          \"interval\":\"+2HOUR\",\r\n          \"maxFutureMs\":\"14400000\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n      \"create-collection\" : {\r\n        \"config\":\"_default\",\r\n        \"numShards\": 3,\r\n        \"tlogReplicas\":1,\r\n        \"pullReplicas\":1,\r\n        \"properties\" : {\r\n          \"foobar\":\"bazbam\"\r\n        }\r\n     }  \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nExisting alias tests continue to pass.  New unit tests added in CreateAliasAPITest.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently,  there is no possibility of deciding how many features to log.\r\nIt would be useful to give the user the ability to decide if to print all the features of the store or only the features used by the model.\r\nSuppose to execute a query with both logging and reranking, where the logging store is the same as the model store. \r\nSuppose the model store contains 200 features while the model uses just half of them.\r\nThe logging will always consider all the 200 features of the store. \r\nThere is no possibility of printing only the 100 features used by the model.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nAn external parameter _logAll_ has been added to the features transformer in order to give the user the possibility to choose how many features to log.\r\nThe new parameter has been added to:\r\n- solr/modules/ltr/src/java/org/apache/solr/ltr/FeatureLogger.java\r\n- solr/modules/ltr/src/java/org/apache/solr/ltr/CSVFeatureLogger.java\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nSeveral tests have been added into org/apache/solr/ltr/feature/TestFeatureLogging.java\r\nWe add one test for each feature logger store - logAll parameter combination.\r\nWe checked that the set of features returned is the expected on (all the features in the store or only the model features).\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [X] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [X] I have

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>grpc/grpc-java</summary>\n\n### [`v1.55.1`](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases/tag/v1.55.1)\n\nThe 1.55.0 release failed. There were no artifacts published for it.\n\n##### API Changes\n\n-   services: Rename `MetricRecorder.setQps`/`clearQps` to `setQpsMetric`/`clearQpsMetric` ([#&#8203;10031](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10031))\n\n##### Behavior Changes\n\n-   gcp-observability: Remove monitored resource detection for logging ([https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/10020](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/10020)). The cloud libraries will fill in these details instead\n-   protoc-gen-grpc-java: binaries for Linux ARM and PPC are now built using Ubuntu 18.04. They will no longer work on Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian 9\n\n##### New Features\n\n-   api: Stabilize the frequently used compression APIs ([#&#8203;9942](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9942)): `CallOptions.withCompression`, `CallOptions.getCompressor`, `AbstractStub.withCompression`,  `ServerCall.setCompression`, `ServerCall.setMessageCompression`\n-   api: Stabilize `Detachable` and `HasByteBuffer`\n-   gcp-observability: Stabilize `GcpObservability` ([https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/10024](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/10024)). The GcpObservability API provides a simple way to export logging, tracing, and metrics to Google Cloud Operations. See [the Google Cloud blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/introducing-grpc-observability-for-microservices).\n-   census: Add new tracer annotation to indicate the time when name resolution completed for those RPCs that experienced name resolution delay, or the time when picking subchannel completed for those RPCs that experienced picking subchannel delay.  ([#&#8203;10014](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10014), [#&#8203;10044](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10044))\n-   protoc-gen-grpc-java: binary for s390x is now published ([#&#8203;9455](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9455)). The glibc version used is available in Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 11, and CentOS 9 and later\n-   authz: Added `FileWatcherAuthorizationServerInterceptor` ([#&#8203;9775](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9775))\n-   services: Added `OrcaMetricReportingServerInterceptor.create(MetricRecorder)` which adds common metrics per-RPC ([#&#8203;9902](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9902))\n-   android: Add `UdsChannelBuilder` for using LocalSocket an Android ([#&#8203;8418](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/8418))\n-   alts: Observe the `GRPC_ALTS_MAX_CONCURRENT_HANDSHAKES` environment variable user to adjust the max number of concurrent ALTS handshakes ([#&#8203;10016](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10016))\n-   binder: Expose client identity via `PeerUid` and `PeerUids` ([#&#8203;9952](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9952))\n-   binder: Add `BindServiceFlags.setAllowActivityStarts()` for `BIND_ALLOW_ACTIVITY_STARTS` added in Android U ([#&#8203;10008](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10008))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   core: Fix NPE race during hedging ([https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/10007](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/10007)), fixing a Netty buffer memory leak for cancelled RPCs\n-   core: Allow transparent retries after a retry attempt and the configured max retries was 1 ([#&#8203;10066](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10066))\n-   okhttp: properly implement `OkHttpServerBuilder.maxConnectionAgeGrace()` ([#&#8203;9968](https://togithub.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9968))\n-   xds: Enable federation support. See [gRFC A47](https://togithub.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A47-xds-federation.md)\n-   xds: Enable Weighted Round Robin LB policy support.

you are a project committer then you may remove some/all of the following template.)_\r\n\r\nBefore creating a pull request, please file an issue in the ASF Jira system for Solr:\r\n\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SOLR\r\n\r\nFor something minor (i.e. that wouldn't be worth putting in release notes), you can skip JIRA. \r\nTo create a Jira issue, you will need to create an account there first.\r\n\r\nThe title of the PR should reference the Jira issue number in the form:\r\n\r\n* SOLR-####: <short description of problem or changes>\r\n\r\nSOLR must be fully capitalized. A short description helps people scanning pull requests for items they can work on.\r\n\r\nProperly referencing the issue in the title ensures that Jira is correctly updated with code review comments and commits. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nThe getKnnVectorsFormatForField() override in SchemaCodecFactory doesn't seem to be covered by any of the existing tests.\r\n\r\nAdding basic test points could be useful to detect future regressions, similar to the recent https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-16588\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nAdded testKnnVectorsFormat() and testUnsupportedKnnVectorsFormat() to the existing TestCodecSupport\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nThe tests provide a basic coverage of both branches. I believe that testKnnVectorsFormat would have detected SOLR-16588\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [X] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [X] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [X] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch. (optional but recommended)\r\n- [X] I have developed this patch against the `main` branch.\r\n- [X] I have run `./gradlew check`.\r\n- [X] I have added tests for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have added

Description\r\n\r\nThe Dockerfiles should contain the `--no-install-recommends` option wherever there is an `apt-get install` command. This should help improve the security of the container and reduce the risk of potential attacks.\r\n\r\nIn detail, the `--no-install-recommends` option helps remove unnecessary apt packages that are not needed for the container's functionality. This change can not only trim your image size but also reduce the attack surface.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this information useful.

Description\r\n\r\nSolr is currently making slow progress in moving its v2 APIs in a more REST-ful direction.  Many APIs have been improved, but many remaining including the commonly used API to create collections.\r\n \r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nThis commit makes various cosmetic improvements to Solr's v2 create collection API, to bring it more into line with the more REST-ful v2 design.  This mostly includes tweaking a few parameter names, and removing the \"create\" top-level key representing the \"command\".\r\n\r\nIt also migrates the API definition to JAX-RS.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nUnit tests for converting between the v1 and v2 parameter formats have been added in `CreateCollectionAPITest`.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch.

Description\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit the v2 APIs for create-collection, create-alias, and restore-collection were all made available as separate \"commands\" under the \"POST /collections\" API. This doesn't match the REST-ful design we're hoping to shoot for with v2, and having the APIs all exposed at the same path makes it hard to convert the APIs to JAX-RS or make any further API modifications (see #1453 for more context).\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this problem by temporarily changing these APIs to use more differentiated paths:\r\n  - `POST /api/collections` for create-collection (no change)\r\n  - `POST /api/aliases` for create-alias\r\n  - `POST /api/backups/backupName/restore` for restore-collection\r\n\r\nThis brings the APIs closer (but not fully) into line with their more REST-ful v2 forms, and allows us to make further API modifications and convert to JAX-RS individually.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\n\r\nPlease describe the tests you've developed or run to confirm this patch implements the feature or solves the problem.\r\n\r\n# Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease review the following and check all that apply:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed the guidelines for [How to Contribute](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute) and my code conforms to the standards described there to the best of my ability.\r\n- [x] I have created a Jira issue and added the issue ID to my pull request title.\r\n- [x] I have given Solr maintainers [access](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to contribute to my PR branch.
