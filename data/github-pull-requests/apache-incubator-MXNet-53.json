Description ##\r\nThe website's different versions show people old and sometimes inaccurate info. This PR redirects traffic to old version content to the latest info.\r\nAPI docs traffic is unaffected. Although I redirect ONNX to the latest.\r\n\r\nIt should combine nicely with the other htaccess redirects for Clojure and error documents that I have in #12426.\r\n\r\n## Stats\r\n~3% of site traffic coming from search goes directly to old pages. 5 out of the top 10 of these pages are old installation info. These will all get redirected, helping hundreds of users per week get to the right info!\r\n\r\n## Detail on Each Change\r\n\r\n1. Architecture - why would someone want to read about MXNet's architecture from v0.11.0? The differences may be minor and these pages are not maintained across versions. There's no reflection on differences that might have occurred over time, their trade-offs or benefits, or anything helpful. Usually it's going to be someone coming in from a search result.\r\n\r\n2. Community - there is no benefit in showing someone old info about how to engage with the community. The old info is most likely inaccurate.\r\n\r\n3. FAQ - again, people are coming off of search results. Giving someone a how-to on the things used to work, is likely going to give them a bad experience.\r\n\r\n4. Gluon - an informational set of pages like these should be up-to-date and not versioned.\r\n\r\n5. Install - this page has a versions dropdown and the collection of pages tell you how to install MXNet today. No one maintains the old branches' install pages. They're probably wrong.\r\n\r\n6. Tutorials - no one maintains the tutorials or tests the tutorials in the old branches. Why let people get frustrated with tutorials that don't work?\r\n\r\n7. ONNX - it's so new and changing that giving people the old info is just a bad idea.

Description ##\r\nThis PR contains some addition in NDArray as well as Java compatible functionalities for Scala package.\r\n\r\n**`ArgBuilder`**: Allows user to pass in a single variable or a batch variables to construct a Scala Sequence or Scala Map.\r\n\r\n**`NDArray`**: \r\n- Brings some improvement on NDArray such as a `toString` method that can allow user to see a formatted output. \r\n- Add `new NDArray()` constructor allowing Java users to create a new one through this way. \r\n- Operator improvement: Adding `add`, `subtract` methods to allow java user use them\r\n\r\nUnit test is coming soon...\r\n\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres \r\n\r\n## Demo code ##\r\n```java\r\nimport org.apache.mxnet.*;\r\nimport org.apache.mxnet.api.java.*;\r\n\r\n\r\npublic class playjava {\r\n\r\n

Description ##\r\nThis is an implementation of the paper [A Structured Self-Attentive Sentence Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03130)，using Mxnet/Gluon.Finally, the experiment was carried out on the user review star classification task mentioned in the original paper, and used the same data set: [The reviews of Yelp Data](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset#yelp_academic_dataset_review.json). \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nAdd example: Implementation of Structured-Self-Attentive-Sentence-Embedding\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nFix #10920\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Bump up atol for test_sparse_dot\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nWas only off by a small margin, should be a rare numerical edge case, bumping up atol to accommodate.","created_at":"2018-09-12T01:43:52Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T03:35:46Z","closed_at":"2018-09-12T03:35:45Z","merged_at":"2018-09-12T03:35:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"90599e1038a4ff6604e9ed0d55dc274c2df635f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/deed4af7c4c01776901d9b002d2f47ce4c799c7e","head":{"label":"haojin2:fix_flaky_test_sparse_dot","ref":"fix_flaky_test_sparse_dot","sha":"deed4af7c4c01776901d9b002d2f47ce4c799c7e","user":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114436356,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ0MzYzNTY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"haojin2/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

there-by preprocessing the fusing-of-weights before calling forward.  Also, when running inference fusing-of-weights is not required for each batch - only once is suffice.\r\n\r\nSome of the alternative approaches are \r\n 1. Fuse Parameters() when created.\r\n 2. Fuse the weights in \".initialize()\" if we are running in inference mode and if all the parameters are initialized. \r\n\r\nSending a PR as a first-draft to get some early

Description ##\r\nIntegrate MXNet with the Intel nGraph compiler using the Subgraph API feature. This PR provides integration for a number of models on the CPU. More models and backends will be coming in future PRs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] nGraph Integration through the Subgraph API\r\n- [x] Better performance on a number of CPU models\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-10T20:10:14Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T05:42:32Z","closed_at":"2019-08-07T17:44:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba24678940a39861514a0d50778a86d4b947dd04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nFix a memleak reported locally by ASAN during a normal inference test.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-10T15:27:05Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T21:50:18Z","closed_at":"2018-09-20T21:50:18Z","merged_at":"2018-09-20T21:50:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"33876c2e0f840ac9e79c3de94bdd89c3a8df5828","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nIn the example directory, there are some test cases that exits some small bugs and missed options  running  on CPU.  Thie pull request is to add the CPU options and fix some small bugs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n#### add CPU option ####\r\n- [x] bayesian-methods\r\n- [x] fcn-xs\r\n- [x] multi-task\r\n- [x] rcnn\r\n- [x] rnn-time-major\r\n#### small bugs fix ####\r\n- [x] rcnn\r\n- [x] cnn_visualization\r\n#### file location change ####\r\n- [x] module\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv

Description ##\r\nIntroduce Symbol.random and NDArray.random modules in scala API\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Symbol.random api generated by macros\r\n- NDArray.random api generated by macros\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- ~~Is there any JIRA mentioning this feature ?~~ \r\n- ~~Only implemented for Symbol. Adding the same for NDArray seems quite straightforward. Tell me if I should to it in the same PR or in a separate~~\r\n- ~~I *moved* functions from Symbol.api to Symbol.random. Is it OK ?~~\r\n- The produced API is not strictly similar to the one in python: \r\n   * in python, each function, eg random.normal, has 2 overrides, one scalar, one symbolic.\r\n   * the generated scala api has different namings: Symbol.random.sample_normal for symbol inputs, and Symbol.random.random_normal for scalars. The arguments naming is also not fully consistent (mu & sigma, vs loc & scale). \r\n   => What are your recommendations on this ?\r\n- The unit-test is poor. What should be tested for generated code like this ?\r\n

Description ##\r\nFixes flakiness with ImageRecordIter augmentation seed tests (#11359) by moving the seed_aug parameter and RNG seeding out of the default augmenter. We now seed the RNG before each image augmentation (if seed_aug parameter is set). This guarantees reproducibility while still enabling multithreaded augmentation (thus fixing the flakiness).\r\nAdditionally, it makes the test more robust by testing the whole iterator and not just the first image.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-08T11:25:41Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T18:47:18Z","closed_at":"2019-01-18T18:45:29Z","merged_at":"2019-01-18T18:45:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"d07187b5ef46424613c1833670f5a1b8d9913245","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11933\r\nHi @marcoabreu @KellenSunderland @szha @nswamy ,\r\n\r\nThis PR will show off the ways that we can use CI to publish Scala package to Maven. As we discussed earlier in the mailing list, the publish process should be done in a restricted node with AWS credential provided.\r\n\r\nBe aware, this package will be formed into a pure dynamically-linked way which means no dependencies will be wrapped together into a single piece.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-09-07T18:51:57Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:09:44Z","closed_at":"2018-10-08T20:02:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20089edb5c910b1030b38792ed75297f030db8a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR helps make our TensorRT builds more portable by statically linking protobuf.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\nIn reproducing a network originally defined in Caffe, I realized that MXNet had no equivalent LR scheduler. As a user of MXNet, I would like to be able to use such an LR scheduler, so I added one.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- No tests exist currently for LR Scheduler(s), willing to add some if that is deemed useful.\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- Matches previous LR scheduler implementation, also willing to add some if deemed useful.\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add `PolyScheduler` in `cpp-package/include/mxnet-cpp/lr_scheduler.h`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Matches quite closely the FactorScheduler implementation just above, but am happy to make other changes.","created_at":"2018-09-06T00:43:35Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T17:57:45Z","closed_at":"2018-11-27T17:57:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"733f7d0865b1b544d8b4cbce6525434f756f86d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nThis PR removes some legacy Travis code, and updates Travis to run cached MXNet builds on the platform.  It is the first step in re-enabling MacOS testing.  Subsequent PRs will enable testing (which will rely on builds first being cached).  Subsequent PRs can also re-enable some of the features removed in this PR, for instance possible running more tests in addition to python tests, and re-enabling the model-download caching folder.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-05T10:09:34Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T22:46:31Z","closed_at":"2018-09-05T22:46:31Z","merged_at":"2018-09-05T22:46:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"28cb75af38c9b6ef4d34b283535eea04714525d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nFollow-up for #12425, add extra prevention to catch illegal reshape case for convenient method.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Extra check for illegal cases\r\n- [x] Corresponding unit tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nNew test is a pure logic test, no possible

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nMXNet Executor isn't thread-safe and thus the predictor is also not thread-safe. However, there is a use case that we want to parallel inference of the same model with multiple threads. In this case, we need to create multiple executors that share the same weight arrays. The current C predict API doesn't support this. As such, we add a new API to create multiple predictors for parallel inference and show the use of this new API in the example of image classification.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

Description ##\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11412 - by adding missing modules to the docs coverage.\r\n\r\nThere appear to be several modules that are not included in the Python docs. This PR specifically addresses those mentioned in #11412 - `test_utils` and `visualization`.\r\n\r\nI put these in a \"tools\" folder. It seemed to make sense.\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\nhttp://34.201.8.176/versions/python_tools/api/python/index.html#tools\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\nLMK what other missing APIs should go in the tools folder. There seem to be a lot of things in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/python/mxnet that aren't covered. If someone wants to make an issue and tag me in it, I can handle those in another PR. \r\n\r\nSomething is wrong with the shorthand invocations. The way the docs pipeline is setup and the way Sphinx is reading things makes it so `mxnet.viz` doesn't work. Therefore only the long version `mxnet.visualiztion` is mentioned in these docs.

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis adds a `with-resources` macro to the Clojure package to provide an idiomatic way, (similar to `with-open`), to explicitly dispose of resources with a `.dispose` call.\r\n\r\nIt works with any Scala object that has a `.dispose` method -  NDArray, Symbol, Executor, Iterators, etc..\r\n\r\nUsage is:\r\n\r\n```clojure \r\n(util/with-resources [a (ndarray/ones [3])\r\n                      b (ndarray/ones [3])]\r\n    (ndarray/+ a b))\r\n```\r\nAny resources in the binding vector will be disposed. Result resources will not.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The Scala package uses scopes with an NDArrayCollector. However, scopes do not mesh well with the Clojure language and the macro pattern for `with-open` for resources is well established and idiomatic in Clojure.\r\n- This will allow users to better control the resources and memory management, however it is not a full solution. There is still investigation into other avenues ongoing with the Scala package.\r\n- Applications of with-resources to the examples will happen in a separate PR\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-03T20:18:14Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T00:26:54Z","closed_at":"2018-09-13T00:26:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1fb13ab2403993c66bfed2bfb431390cd77241ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":863183895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NjMxODM4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Clojure","name":"Clojure","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes the flaky topk test reported in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12358 , https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12310. The previous bug is caused by not manually setting the dtype of mx.ndarrays when constructing them  from numpy ndarrays (related issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12268). After reimplementing the `IndexFill` function, the test passes now.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] fix topk and its testing codes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- we really need to fix

Description ##\r\nGithub Issue #12327\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-12430/3/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] The `diag` operator now supports N-d arrays where `N > 2`. In this case it behaves in the same way as the `diagonal` operator provided by numpy (https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.diagonal.html). Axes of the sub-arrays can be specified with `axis1` and `axis2`.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This change is an extension to the existing interface, and therefore completely back

Description ##\r\nFix for #12248.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add cudnn_off option to BilinearSampler\r\n- [x] Remove old flaky unit test for BilinearSampler\r\n- [x] Add new unit test of consistency for BilinearSampler\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nCPU, GPU and CuDNN versions all failed on the same seed with the same \"wrong\" number, which means our 2 versions are consistent with the CuDNN version, so the reference answer calculated by the original helper function within the unit test should be problem here. Changing the test from comparing to the reference answer to a consistency check where the 3 versions are compared against each other to check for

Description ##\r\nThe PR applies the website theme to each version. The navigation will be the same, so the option for Clojure needs to be handled properly for old versions. For this I use the .htaccess file to redirect users to an API error page. For good measure, I also added a custom 404 error page.\r\n\r\nThis PR stacks on #12413 (has the same changes in build_all_version.sh), plus a change to copy the theme, and fixes my concerns there with the theme.\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\nhttp://34.201.8.176/\r\nYou can test the redirect if you switch to an old version like 1.0.0 and go to API --> Clojure\r\nYou can look at the 404:\r\nhttp://34.201.8.176/error/404.html \r\nIf you trigger a 404 by going to an [invalid link](http://34.201.8.176/123) it goes to the non-existent production URL. I didn't use a relative link because that won't update the URL and this causes formatting issues (described in the convo below) when `sidebar.js` does all of its wacky `document.ready` injections.

Description ##\r\nFixes a bug in the docs build pipeline where a failover case didn't checkout a different branch as expected. This caused master API docs to appear in older versions in CI. Local builds would run fine.\r\n\r\nAdded a hard error stop on the checkout step to prevent any issue like this popping up silently in CI.\r\nAlso fixed the echo statement to print exactly what should be run next.\r\nAlso removed Clojure from the v1.2.0 settings for docs generation. These should only generate in master or in 1.3.0+. \r\n\r\nFor example, in the CI logs:\r\n```\r\n+ git checkout v1.0.0\r\nerror: pathspec 'v1.0.0' did not match any file(s) known to git.\r\n+ git branch v1.0.0 upstream/v1.0.0\r\nBranch v1.0.0 set up to track remote branch v1.0.0 from upstream.\r\n```\r\nIt checks if the branch is there already, if not it grabs it from upstream. What is missing here is that it also needed to checkout the newly created branch. If all fails then the process aborts on this step, rather than continue with master.\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\nThe consistent theme is patched in a separate PR: #12426.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-30T17:29:40Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T19:42:12Z","closed_at":"2018-08-31T19:42:12Z","merged_at":"2018-08-31T19:42:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ace01cd4e809428a2177501f91df41d167ae11b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4a339a67ade7a6b581dbdf8e1e417bd54c3f269b","head":{"label":"aaronmarkham:docs_branch_checkout_fix","ref":"docs_branch_checkout_fix","sha":"4a339a67ade7a6b581dbdf8e1e417bd54c3f269b","user":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105819747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MTk3NDc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nPR to address (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10994). There is a case where users may want to run the backwards pass but not record any gradients (https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/autograd/autograd.html#mxnet.autograd.record - this should be addressed in a later PR as it does not make sense). MKLDNN does not handle this case and instead we will fallback.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-30T16:29:07Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T18:04:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-27T18:04:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67c5eef8257298404de9aac12b6c11086fec912b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nPreviously all mkldnn tests and helpers were in a single file mkldnn.cc. The file was becoming untenably long. I split this file into three files.\r\n\r\nmkldnn_utils.h (helper utilities used for tests such as creating test fixtures)\r\nmkldnn_operators_test.cc (test mkldnn operators)\r\nmkldnn_test.cc (test mkldnn helper functions)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] split mkldnn.cc into three files\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-30T14:37:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T04:54:12Z","closed_at":"2018-10-26T04:54:12Z","merged_at":"2018-10-26T04:54:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"fef9b5c6e3ddf90b2d521a1393004b95a4b16855","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis is the first step of supporting dynamic shape in mxnet. As the first step, the PR only supports dynamic shape in the imperative mode. It creates a boolean_mask operator to test dynamic shape.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nThis PR updates a C++ image classification example, fixing grammar, and adding instructions so it can be run through the first time.\r\nCurrently, you will segfault and fail a few times until you read through all of the tips and troubleshoot.\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\nMaybe this example should be moved into the cpp-package folder? Or, should the examples in the cpp-package folder be moved out to the general /mxnet/example folder?\r\n\r\nMaybe this should use something from the model zoo instead of linking to old models on data.mxnet.io?\r\n\r\nWe can always do either of these later and just get this fixed up for

branch\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12326\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nDifferent installation pages were out of date or out of sync. The install page was over-complicated. The build from source instructions weren't really working.\r\n\r\nThis PR consolidates install info, directs users to where the more recent updates happen to be, and simplifies the basic user install. I started off just trying to fix the C++ setup info, but found so many other issues, I worked on those too.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Fixes a bug that made it so you couldn't preview the dev version's install page without it redirecting you. (options.js)\r\n* Updates the [build_from_source](http://34.201.8.176/versions/cplusplus_install/install/build_from_source.html) page \r\n    - Point to the OS-focused pages where this information is most up-to-date.\r\n    - Added a [table that maps links to each binding](http://34.201.8.176/versions/cplusplus_install/install/build_from_source.html#installing-mxnet-language-bindings).\r\n    - Leaves the centos/other linux sections there since this info isn't covered elsewhere\r\n    - Leaves the NCCL section alone (is this even current info?)\r\n    - Links this page in the [Download Source section](http://34.201.8.176/versions/cplusplus_install/install/index.html) found at the bottom of install\r\n* Creates a new [C++ setup page](http://34.201.8.176/versions/cplusplus_install/install/c_plus_plus.html) that brings together C++ info found around the project.\r\n* Refactors the install page. \r\n    - Moves the [validation section to a new page](http://34.201.8.176/versions/cplusplus_install/install/validate_mxnet.html)\r\n    - Removes virtualenv (this was repeated multiple times in the file w/o much real value\r\n    - Super simplifies the pip install sections\r\n    - Links back to each OS's detailed setup guides\r\n    - Links to specific install guide sections for Perl and Julia\r\n    - and more... the file went from 2531 lines to 1062. So much easier to deal with... probably could take more pruning...\r\n* Fixes some issues on the OS guide pages - the Python binding steps were missing\r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nThe Scala package has updated the DataDesc to include Layout. The Clojure package has been updated to move inline with it.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- A layout namespace has been created and used in DataDesc\r\n- The Clojure package no longer infers the layout from the shape. It handles it the same way as the Scala package by having it be undefined\r\n- The original `module.fit` interop code has been restored. The work arounds required by the old DataDesc has been resolved with this PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11844\r\n- Most of the examples have moved to use `provide-data-desc` instead of `provide-data`\r\n- Formatting fixes\r\n- Tweak to Char RNN example to run for less epochs before showing the pre-loaded result\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-28T23:22:48Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T00:06:00Z","closed_at":"2018-09-13T00:05:57Z","merged_at":"2018-09-13T00:05:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8153f6449d5628491ef2ec4e10871643e8ba5c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":863183895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NjMxODM4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Clojure","name":"Clojure","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f8a125b3b2b9badf374c5b4997baa86756205f4a","head":{"label":"gigasquid:update-data-desc-clojure","ref":"update-data-desc-clojure","sha":"f8a125b3b2b9badf374c5b4997baa86756205f4a","user":{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113923015,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM5MjMwMTU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"gigasquid/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Support more req type patterns for backward

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR adds mechanisms on the build scripts to cleanup docker containers when there is a cancellation, either from the user by sending SIGINT / SIGTERM or when the process inside the container ends with an error.\r\n\r\nIt also propagates the environment variables from Jenkins which are used by the process tree killer to identify runaway processes so processes inside the container are killed when the Jenkins job is stopped.\r\n\r\nWith this patch we catch SIGINT and SIGTERM and install a handler on atexit which cleans (stops) docker containers which were created during execution of the build.\r\n\r\nWe also switch to python docker API for better management of running containers.\r\n\r\n@aaronmarkham @marcoabreu @lebeg @KellenSunderland \r\n\r\n## Checklist

Description ##\r\nCurrently we rely on the omp lib (omp_set_max_threads/omp_get_max_threads) to set/fetch the max number threads. However, there is known issue with openmp where the num_thread values do not get updated in a multithreaded environment (https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-c-compiler/topic/494242). We will keep track of the num_threads manually.\r\n\r\nThis has caused an issue when the library is called in multi-threaded environment. we will instead only call omp_get_max_threads once and cached the result.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] reserve method modifies num_max_thread directly\r\n- [x] GetRecommendedOMPThreadCount uses cached version  \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-28T15:06:50Z","updated_at":"2018-11-25T07:49:27Z","closed_at":"2018-11-15T01:21:25Z","merged_at":"2018-11-15T01:21:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"75410210e07a5fab5e044348aee276d578d5857e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nSVRG stands for Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient, which is an optimization technique that complements SGD. It is introduced in the paper _[Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent using Predicative Variance Reduction](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4937-accelerating-stochastic-gradient-descent-using-predictive-variance-reduction.pdf)_ in 2013. \r\nKey Characteristics of SVRG: \r\n- Explicit Variance Reduction\r\n- Converge much faster compared to SGD on strongly convex smooth functions   \r\n\r\nSVRG Module should:\r\n- seamlessly supports both dense and sparse data, run on CPU and GPU instances on single machine and in distributed setting.\r\n- minimize the API differences with Python Module API.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-854], where MXNET-854 refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-854) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- SVRGModule inherits from Python Module and minimizes the API changes of Module API. Both intermediate level and high level APIs are supported\r\n- Functional tests and unittests have been tested for SVRGModule and SVRG Optimizer.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Design decisions of why using Python Module instead of Optimizer can be found in the design doc [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/SVRG+Optimization+in+MXNet+Python+Module)\r\n- This version of SVRGModule supports single machine run with single cpu, single gpu and multiple-gpus. Distributed SVRGModule is soon to be updated.\r\n- Benchmarking has been performed on this single machine version SVRGModule on single cpu on linear regression model. Distributed SVRGModule to be updated soon. Benchmarking results can be found in contrib/svrg_optimization_python/benchmarks.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-27T22:12:08Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T18:44:16Z","closed_at":"2018-09-10T18:44:16Z","merged_at":"2018-09-10T18:44:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"3406845534451f71e33e9a5775a42fc049a9ea2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556117,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTYxMTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nthe public header `resource.h` current has internal dependencies. public headers should only define interfaces and should not include internal dependencies as it allows users to access non-exposed interfaces. move random_generator.h into public header domain. move private implementations into respective .cc files.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ]move random_generator.h into public header domain. move private implementations into respective .cc files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by
