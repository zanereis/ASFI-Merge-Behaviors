Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\nFixes #xyz\r\n\r\n<!-- or this PR is one task of an issue -->\r\n\r\nMain Issue: #xyz\r\n\r\n<!-- If the PR belongs to a PIP, please add the PIP link here -->\r\n\r\nPIP: #xyz \r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWhile debugging an error for function trigger, the logs only print: `Function in trigger function is not ready @ /public/default/test`, which is useless without the error stack trace, it's better to add it, I also found other `log.error` missed the \"exception\" argument while most of `log.error` has it.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd exception as the last argument to calling of `log.error` which missed it\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n- [x] This change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION. CHECK THE PROPER BOX ONLY. -->\r\n\r\n*If the box was checked, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dependencies (add or upgrade a dependency)\r\n- [ ] The public API\r\n- [ ] The schema\r\n- [ ] The default values of configurations\r\n- [ ] The threading model\r\n- [ ] The binary protocol\r\n- [ ] The REST endpoints\r\n- [ ] The admin CLI options\r\n- [ ] The metrics\r\n- [ ] Anything that affects deployment\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nAttempting to enable both the transaction coordinator (TC) and the Extensible Load Manager (ELM) leads brokers to fail on startup. The ELM is initialized before the TC, which causes a null pointer exception to be thrown when creating ([here](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/86dc039215e0a47d48dd06a9716b8b26385891bd/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentTopic.java#L354)) or subscribing ([here](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/86dc039215e0a47d48dd06a9716b8b26385891bd/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentSubscription.java#L161)) to service unit state topic `persistent://pulsar/system/loadbalancer-service-unit-state`.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nDisable transactions for the respective topic, as it is an internal topic not meant to be part of any transaction.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added integration tests `org.apache.pulsar.tests.integration.messaging.MessagingSmokeTest` validating messaging functionality still works when the ELM only is enabled, and when both the ELM and TC are enabled. The test can be easily extended to add more broker configuration combinations. Note that it takes around 9 minutes to run one combination. This test could be a candidate for a lower-frequency test job. Suggestions welcome.\r\n  - Added unit test `ExtensibleLoadManagerImplWithTransactionCoordinatorTest#testUnloadAdminAPI` to quickly validate that the broker can start with both features enabled and perform a basic API call into the ELM.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n*If the box was checked, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dependencies (add or upgrade a dependency)\r\n- [ ] The public API\r\n- [ ] The schema\r\n- [ ] The default values of configurations\r\n- [ ] The threading model\r\n- [ ] The binary protocol\r\n- [ ] The REST endpoints\r\n- [ ] The admin CLI options\r\n- [ ] The metrics\r\n- [ ] Anything that affects deployment\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

detailed improvement instructions, please refer to issues：\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/22134\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe current Java client implementation has certain flaws in automatic fault switching.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.pulsar.client.impl.AutoClusterFailover.java\r\nboolean probeAvailable(String url) {\r\n        try {\r\n            resolver.updateServiceUrl(url);\r\n            InetSocketAddress endpoint = resolver.resolveHost();\r\n            Socket socket = new Socket();\r\n            socket.connect(new InetSocketAddress(endpoint.getHostName(), endpoint.getPort()), TIMEOUT);\r\n            socket.close();\r\n\r\n            return true\r\n        } catch (Exception e) {\r\n            log.warn(\"Failed to probe available, url: {}\", url, e);\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe client only establishes a TCP connection with the exposed connection address of the cluster to determine whether the cluster is available, which cannot adapt to scenarios where the cluster is partially unavailable (half dead). In this scenario, we hope to make corresponding fault switching judgments by initiating cluster health status requests to the cluster. Then within the cluster, we provide an admin management command to update the cluster's health status. To avoid this scenario, all businesses that need to connect to this cluster need to manually switch cluster connection addresses and restart applications, resulting in inconsistent link data among multiple business team due to inconsistent operation steps.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n1. Add a new cluster health status request and response request;\r\n```\r\ncase HEALTH_CHECK:\r\n\tcheckArgument(cmd.hasHealthCheck());\r\n\thandleHealthCheck(cmd.getHealthCheck());\r\n\tbreak;\r\n\r\ncase HEALTH_CHECK_RESPONSE:\r\n\tcheckArgument(cmd.hasHealthCheckResponse());\r\n\thandleHealthCheckResponse(cmd.getHealthCheckResponse());\r\n\tbreak;        \r\n\r\n//PulsarApi.proto define two new request types.\r\nmessage CommandHealthCheck {\r\n    repeated KeyValue metadata = 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage CommandHealthCheckResponse {\r\n    optional bool available = 1 [default = true];\r\n}    \r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add a new admin management command to manually update the cluster health status;\r\n```\r\n//Update cluster health status, available or unavailable. default available\r\nbin/pulsar-admin clusters update-health-status --status unavailable\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor other detailed information, please refer to the PR code.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently the Functions Worker eagerly unpacks and extracts all Pulsar IO connectors when the function worker starts up.\r\nThis takes a significant amount of CPU resources and also slows down the startup. On Kubernetes with an empheral filesystem, this will happen every single time the Functions Worker is restarted. \r\nWhen CPU is limited with k8s resource limits on the Functions Worker, this problem is even worse.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nRefactor the Functions Worker in a way where it is possible to do minimal work at startup time. This requires avoiding class loading and therefore this PR contains a refactoring where the previous logic that was coupled with classloading is now decoupled. Instead of classloading, Byte Buddy library is used to read the required metadata from the functions and connector packages. \r\nInstead of using the JarFile API, NarClassloader has been modified to use the ZipFile API since the Nar files don't need any features that are specific to Jar file handling.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nThere was a previous PR #17902 that made the unpacking run in parallel. Those changes aren't needed any more since startup will be fast when no nar files are unpacked on startup time.\r\nThis PR doesn't require a PIP since this doesn't change external interfaces. This doesn't introduce new external features and is also a bug fix for the maintained Pulsar releases.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n\r\nUpon Assigning and Releasing, if this broker is not the dst broker, return the dst broker as the owner(or empty). Clients need to connect(redirect) to the dst broker anyway and wait for the dst broker to receive `Owned`. This is also required to return getOwnerAsync on the src broker immediately during unloading. Otherwise, topic creation(getOwnerAsync) could block unloading bundles, if the topic creation(getOwnerAsync) happens during unloading on the src broker.\r\n\r\nFound a case that the broker role might change in the middle while running playLeader or playFollower. In this case, we need to break the init loop and restart playLeader or playFollower according to the current role.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Return getOwnerAsync without waiting on source broker upon Assigning and Releasing\r\n- Updated role change logic in case the role changes again while initializing the current role.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn Pulsar, users have reported issues that could be caused by \"double release\" or \"use after release\" bugs with recycled objects.\r\n\r\nHere's are some issues that could potentially be caused by \"double release\" or \"use after release\" bugs:\r\n#22035\r\n#21892\r\n\r\nOther example of such potential issue: #21421/#21933. It is possible that these issues are fixed by https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/4196. The other root cause could be a \"double release\" or \"use after release\" bug which is corrupting the buffer and causing checksum calculation to fail.\r\n\r\nOutside of Java, there's a known bug pattern called [\"double-free\" or \"Doubly freeing memory\" (with malloc)](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Doubly_freeing_memory). \r\nThe \"double release\" bug pattern is a bit similar, but happens with the recycled object pattern using [Netty's Recycler](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/util/Recycler.html) that Pulsar uses because of performance reasons.\r\n\r\nThere is also a [\"use after free\"](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html) bug pattern. Something similar could be happen with Netty recycled objects that the object instance gets used after releasing. \r\n\r\nThe solution in this PR attempts to help detect \"double release\" and \"use after release\" bugs.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- get rid of any `.setRefCnt(1)` calls in production code since that could hide real issues\r\n- add additional detection feature that can be disabled by setting the system property `-Dpulsar.refcount.check.on_access=false`.\r\n  - the refcount check will add a volatile read. This isn't a performance problem in most use cases. For production usage we could add `-Dpulsar.refcount.check.on_access=false` into the `bin/pulsar` script by default if we are afraid of the performance overhead. For all tests, we should be running with checks enabled so that we could find the source of problems.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/22108\r\n\r\n<!-- or this PR is one task of an issue -->\r\n\r\nMain Issue: #xyz\r\n\r\n<!-- If the PR belongs to a PIP, please add the PIP link here -->\r\n\r\nPIP: #xyz \r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\n\r\nBefore https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21597, The implementation of `getStateStore` for `BKStateStoreProviderImpl` will be called once by `JavaInstanceRunnable` to create the stream table once the instance gets started. But after #21597, the `getStateStore` will be called via the `putstate` and `getstate` APIs without any check, this will cause the creation of a stream table for non-existent functions and connectors.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- add function instance check before `getStateStore`\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

<!-- ENTER URL HERE -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAfter opening this PR, the build in apache/pulsar will fail and instructions will\r\nbe provided for opening a PR in the PR author's forked repository.\r\n\r\napache/pulsar pull requests should be first tested in your own fork since the \r\napache/pulsar CI based on GitHub Actions has constrained resources and quota.\r\nGitHub Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in \r\na forked repository.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be run in the forked repository until all PR review comments have\r\nbeen handled, the tests pass and the PR is approved by a reviewer.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-23T14:36:53Z","updated_at":"2024-02-25T15:59:30Z","closed_at":"2024-02-25T15:56:15Z","merged_at":"2024-02-25T15:56:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c44e1b356cf89bd57cb46390e9e890182778c2f","assignee":{"login":"freeznet","id":1381618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE2MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet","html_url":"https://github.com/freeznet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"freeznet","id":1381618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE2MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1381618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet","html_url":"https://github.com/freeznet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freeznet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3125409143,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI1NDA5MTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/doc-not-needed","name":"doc-not-needed","color":"e0e0e0","default":false,"description":"Your

That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\nFixes #xyz\r\n\r\n<!-- or this PR is one task of an issue -->\r\n\r\nMain Issue: #xyz\r\n\r\n<!-- If the PR belongs to a PIP, please add the PIP link here -->\r\n\r\nPIP: #xyz \r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWe have two configurations to trigger the offload automatically, time and bytes. We only expose the bytes in the admin but didn't expose the time in the admin. When we want to disable it, we need to set both of them to the -1. But we didn't expose the time settings, the offload will never be disabled.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION. CHECK THE PROPER BOX ONLY. -->\r\n\r\n*If the box was checked, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dependencies (add or upgrade a dependency)\r\n- [ ] The public API\r\n- [ ] The schema\r\n- [ ] The default values of configurations\r\n- [ ] The threading model\r\n- [ ] The binary protocol\r\n- [ ] The REST endpoints\r\n- [x] The admin CLI options\r\n- [ ] The metrics\r\n- [ ] Anything that affects deployment\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

<!-- ENTER URL HERE -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nAfter opening this PR, the build in apache/pulsar will fail and instructions will\r\nbe provided for opening a PR in the PR author's forked repository.\r\n\r\napache/pulsar pull requests should be first tested in your own fork since the \r\napache/pulsar CI based on GitHub Actions has constrained resources and quota.\r\nGitHub Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in \r\na forked repository.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be run in the forked repository until all PR review comments have\r\nbeen handled, the tests pass and the PR is approved by a reviewer.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-23T02:28:30Z","updated_at":"2024-03-27T13:30:40Z","closed_at":"2024-02-23T12:23:38Z","merged_at":"2024-02-23T12:23:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"48c7e322fecfbcee0df758bdaf7e9b4263f2835e","assignee":{"login":"zymap","id":24502569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTAyNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24502569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap","html_url":"https://github.com/zymap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zymap","id":24502569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTAyNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24502569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap","html_url":"https://github.com/zymap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zymap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"codelipenghui","id":12592133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTkyMTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12592133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui","html_url":"https://github.com/codelipenghui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codelipenghui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1458669466,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDU4NjY5NDY2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/area/admin","name":"area/admin","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3125409143,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI1NDA5MTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/doc-not-needed","name":"doc-not-needed","color":"e0e0e0","default":false,"description":"Your

Motivation\r\n\r\nA hash could be negative. A \"sign safe modulo\" calculation must be used instead of modulo alone.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Use `MathUtils.signSafeMod` to handle the operation since it does the right thing.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\n* In ConsistentHashingStickyKeyConsumerSelector, there is hardly any impact after #22053 since hash collisions are very rare. It would be an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` in a problem case.\r\n* In HashRangeAutoSplitStickyKeyConsumerSelector and HashRangeExclusiveStickyKeyConsumerSelector, it's possible that negative hashes could cause skewed results.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation & Modifications\r\n\r\n- keep the Gradle Enterprise maven extension version up-to-date\r\n- skip activating Gradle Enterprise maven extension for builds in GitHub Actions when the pull

Motivation\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n- The broker decreases the permits after delivering messages to the client.\r\n  -  It only decreases the un-acked part for permits when delivering batched messages to the client.\r\n- The client acquires more permits after consuming messages.\r\n  - **(Highlight)** It acquires the whole batch for permits even if it only received half of the batched message.\r\n\r\nReproduce step:\r\n- The permits were initialized as `1000`\r\n- Send a batch message containing 100 single messages.\r\n- Ack a half of batched messages(`2` single messages).\r\n- Redeliver the batch message.\r\n- Receive the `98` messages left on the topic.\r\n- **(Highlight)** permits is `1002`.\r\n\r\nOne our ENV, the permits went to `100,000+`(it was initialized as `50`), and leading the set `pendingAcks` went to a huge value. This may causes a client side OOM.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1103\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-21 at 22 55 42\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/25195800/fc10e76a-585d-4ec3-b56b-04aca7e735b2\">\r\n<img width=\"1082\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-02-21 at 23 39 11\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/25195800/57034843-f61c-49bf-a6d3-b8ef6a9a019a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- The client acquires more permits after consuming messages.\r\n  - It acquires the half batch for permits if it only received half of the batched message.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n- After a consumer closes, it may leave an in-progress acknowledge task.\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\n- There are two consumers: `c1` and `c2`\r\n- `c1` received a batch message: `ledger: L1, entry: E1, batch-size: 100`.\r\n- `c1` was closed, after leaving an in-progress task to acknowledge `{L1, E1, batch_index: 1}`\r\n- Pulsar read `{L1, E1}` and tries to delivery to `c2`.\r\n- The acknowledgement `{L1, E1, batch_index: 1}` is finished.\r\n- `c2` gets `100` messages, but `unackedMessages` of `c2` is `98`.\r\n\r\nWe can always get the warn logs like below:\r\n```\r\n07:01:11.037 [pulsar-io-4-17] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.Consumer - unackedMsgs is : -1,\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nFix the bug.\r\n\r\n###

Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently Pulsar's docker image must be run with gid=0. There are environments where the group id 0 is prohibited by default. One example is Tanzu Kubernetes Grid <=1.24 where a default Pod Security Policy called `vmware-system-restricted` is used. That PSP contains this type of rule:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nsupplementalGroups:\r\n  rule: MustRunAs\r\n  ranges:\r\n    - min: 1\r\n      max: 65535\r\nrunAsUser:\r\n  rule: MustRunAsNonRoot\r\nfsGroup:\r\n  rule: MustRunAs\r\n  ranges:\r\n    - min: 1\r\n      max: 65535\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, it's not possible to use Pulsar's docker image since Pulsar needs write access to a few directories.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nchange the owner of the writable directories to user id 10000.\r\n\r\nThis will allow Tanzu to work with this type of securityContext for each Pulsar component (Broker, Zookeeper, Bookkeeper)\r\n```\r\n  securityContext:\r\n    runAsNonRoot: true\r\n    runAsGroup: 10001\r\n    fsGroup: 10001\r\n    runAsUser: 10000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nBefore this fix is included, it's possible to create an overlay image where the ownership is modified for the required directories\r\n\r\nDockerfile\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nARG IMAGE=apachepulsar/pulsar-all\r\nARG TAG=3.0.2\r\nFROM ${IMAGE}:${TAG}\r\nUSER 0\r\nRUN for SUBDIRECTORY in conf data download logs; do \\\r\n     chown -R 10000:0 /pulsar/$SUBDIRECTORY; \\\r\n     done\r\nUSER 10000\r\n```\r\n\r\nsample of building and pushing a patched image:\r\n```\r\ndocker build -t lhotari/pulsar-all-user10000:3.0.2 .\r\ndocker push lhotari/pulsar-all-user10000:3.0.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/security/code-scanning/33, https://github.com/apache/pulsar/security/code-scanning/32\r\n### Motivation\r\nSoftware developers often add stack traces to error messages, as a debugging aid. Whenever that error message occurs for an end user, the developer can use the stack trace to help identify how to fix the problem. In particular, stack traces can tell the developer more about the sequence of events that led to a failure, as opposed to merely the final state of the software when the error occurred.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the same information can be useful to an attacker. The sequence of class names in a stack trace can reveal the structure of the application as well as any internal components it relies on. Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information.

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/security/code-scanning/36\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nExtracting files from a malicious zip file, or similar type of archive, is at risk of directory traversal attacks if filenames from the archive are not properly validated.\r\n\r\nZip archives contain archive entries representing each file in the archive. These entries include a file path for the entry, but these file paths are not restricted and may contain unexpected special elements such as the directory traversal element (..). If these file paths are used to create a filesystem path, then a file operation may happen in an unexpected location. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a zip file contains a file entry `..\\sneaky-file`, and the zip file is extracted to the directory `c:\\output`, then naively combining the paths would result in an output file path of `c:\\output\\..\\sneaky-file`, which would cause the file to be written to `c:\\sneaky-file`.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nVerify that the normalized full path of the output file starts with a prefix that matches the destination directory.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/security/code-scanning/43\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nA JSON Web Token (JWT) consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature. The `io.jsonwebtoken.jjwt` library is one of many libraries used for working with JWTs. It offers different methods for parsing tokens like `parse`, `parseClaimsJws`, and `parsePlaintextJws`. The last two correctly verify that the JWT is properly signed. This is done by computing the signature of the combination of header and payload and comparing the locally computed signature with the signature part of the JWT.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is necessary to provide the `JwtParser` with a key that is used for signature validation. Unfortunately the `parse `method accepts a JWT whose signature is empty although a signing key has been set for the parser. This means that an attacker can create arbitrary JWTs that will be accepted if this method is used.\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nVerify the signature by using the `parseClaimsJws`.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

commit introduces a Github Actions workflow that runs a Trivy container scan on the following Docker containers:\r\n\r\n- apachepulsar/pulsar:3.2.0\r\n- apachepulsar/pulsar-all:3.2.0\r\n\r\nThe workflow runs daily @ 0800 UTC and if it finds any vulnerabilities of HIGH or CRITICAL severity it sends an email including the report to the Pulsar DEV mailing list as well as upload the report to the workflow run in Github.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nOur dependencies are currently scanned via the OWASP dependency checker but we have nothing checking on the vulnerability of our published Docker containers. \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nAs described in the summary, this adds a scheduled workflow that uses [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/) to run a scan against our published Docker containers. \r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\nAs always, Github Actions workflow are a pain to test. I have tested this one in isolation in prototype repository and it works well. We will not be able to verify it until it gets merged into mainline branch. \r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

PR is WIP\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nPIP-61 and PIP-95 isn't fully implemented in the Pulsar code base.\r\nFor example, topic lookup with Admin API is broken when using advertised listeners.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- cover gaps in redirects to handle advertised listeners\r\n- allow having both Pulsar binary protocol (pulsar & pulsar+ssl) and web api (http & https) with the same listener name by removing the unnecessary restriction of max 2 endpoints for a listener name\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n- [PIP-338](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/22039) is related\r\n- https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/17063 is related\r\n- separate issue for [PIP-307 support for advertised listeners](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/22061)\r\n\r\n###

Motivation\r\n\r\nPart of PIP-264 related work to convert metrics to OpenTelemetry format. This PR handles topic lookup metrics, as currently defined in the [documentation](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/next/reference-metrics/#topic-lookup-metrics). \r\n\r\nNote that metric `pulsar_broker_load_manager_bundle_assignment` fits better into the Load Balancing metrics section, so is not included in this work.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdded metrics as described below:\r\n\r\n| Old metric name | New metric details | |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| `pulsar_broker_lookup` | Name | `pulsar.broker.lookup.request.duration` |\r\n| | Type | Histogram |\r\n| | Description | The duration of topic lookup requests (either binary or HTTP)\r\n| | Source | Internal OpenTelemetry implementation\r\n| | Attribute Set | `pulsar.lookup.response=failure` replaces `pulsar_broker_lookup_failures`\r\n| | Attribute Set | `pulsar.lookup.response=broker` replaces `pulsar_broker_lookup_answers`\r\n| | Attribute Set | `pulsar.lookup.response=redirect` replaces `pulsar_broker_lookup_redirects`\r\n| | Cardinality | 3 per broker (one per attribute set)\r\n| `pulsar_broker_lookup_pending_requests` | Name | `pulsar.broker.topic.lookup.operation.pending.usage` |\r\n| | Type | ObservableLongUpDownCounter |\r\n| | Description | The number of pending lookup operations in the broker. When it reaches threshold \\\"maxConcurrentLookupRequest\\\" defined in broker.conf, new requests are rejected.\r\n| | Source | Call to `BrokerService#getPendingLookupRequest`\r\n| | Attributes | (none)\r\n| | Cardinality | 1 per broker\r\n| (new metric) | Name | `pulsar.broker.topic.lookup.operation.pending.limit` |\r\n| | Type | ObservableLongUpDownCounter |\r\n| | Description | The maximum number of pending lookup operations in the broker. Equal to \\\"maxConcurrentLookupRequest\\\" defined in broker.conf.\r\n| | Source | Call to `ServiceConfiguration#getMaxConcurrentLookupRequest`\r\n| | Attributes | (none)\r\n| | Cardinality | 1 per broker\r\n| `pulsar_broker_topic_load_pending_requests` | Name | `pulsar.broker.topic.load.operation.pending.usage` |\r\n| | Type | ObservableLongUpDownCounter |\r\n| | Description | The number of pending topic load operations in the broker. When it reaches threshold \\\"maxConcurrentTopicLoadRequest\\\" defined in broker.conf, new requests are rejected.\r\n| | Source | Call to `BrokerService#getPendingTopicLoadRequests`\r\n| | Attributes | (none)\r\n| | Cardinality | 1 per broker\r\n| (new metric) | Name | `pulsar.broker.topic.load.operation.pending.limit` |\r\n| | Type | ObservableLongUpDownCounter |\r\n| | Description | The maximum number of pending topic load operations in the broker. Equal to \\\"maxConcurrentTopicLoadRequest\\\" defined in broker.conf.\r\n| | Source | Call to `ServiceConfiguration#getMaxConcurrentTopicLoadRequest`\r\n| | Attributes | (none)\r\n| | Cardinality | 1 per broker\r\n\r\nMoved instantiation of `PulsarBrokerOpenTelemetry` object to `PulsarService` constructor, as it is needed by the `NamespaceService` and `BrokerService`. The OpenTelemetry standard recommends setting up the SDK as early as possible, so this suits us well.\r\n\r\nChanged `PulsarTestContext` to allow OpenTelemetry metrics validation as part of the tests. \r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - Extended existing lookup tests `BrokerServiceLookupTest#testMultipleBrokerLookup` and `BrokerServiceLookupTest#testLookupConnectionNotCloseIfGetUnloadingExOrMetadataEx` to cover the metric validation\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n*If the box was checked, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dependencies (add or upgrade a

#22050\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nSee #22050, there's a hash collision in ConsistentHashingStickyKeyConsumerSelector when the consumer name ends with a number for example \"consumer1\" and \"consumer11\" would collide for the key \"consumer111\" (consumer1, i=11 & consumer11, i=1).\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nFix hash collision by adding a separator between the 2 fields used in the hash calculation. Use the NUL character (`\\0`) as a separator.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nA pip proposal to add a new default lookup listener config and fix bug with listener usage's for http protocol.\r\n\r\n**Issue in existing Code flow**\r\nCurrently, the listener mentioned as `internalListenerName` in broker config helps in deciding the listener from the list of `advertisedListeners` to specify the service URL, is being used for broker-to-broker communication but that is exposed to the client in case of lookup results or redirects as well.\r\n\r\nEven if the client sends a `listenerName` (PIP-95) corresponding to the http protocol broker’s addresses, it is only used in the `pulsar` and `pulsar+ssl` protocols and is not consistent for the other protocols.\r\n\r\n**Need to have lookupListener**\r\nIt might not be feasible to have the listerner config at the client side in every tech stack or connector.\r\nAlso,  Currently, there is no option to pass the listener while using the admin APIs. As admin APIs can be called from an external network as well, the use of the internal listener’s broker service URL can lead all admin operations to get affected.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. Fix Code Flow - Inconsistency with listener usage with protocols other than pulsar and pulsar+ssl\r\n2. Add a new config to be considered in case of missing listener in client request and return the broker service URL corresponding to the lookupListener\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make

Motivation\r\n**Fix1: Create new ledger after the current ledger is closed**\r\n#### Background\r\n1. Managerledger has a configuration `maximumRolloverTimeMs` to configure the max time of closing a ledger. \r\n2. The current ledger can be rollover when it reaches `maximumRolloverTimeMs`.\r\n3. The current ledger will not change after it is rollovered. The current ledger only be changed when creating a new ledger. \r\n4. The current ledger can not be deleted, because the current ledger may be written to.\r\n5. The `ClosedLedger` state of the manager indicates that the current ledger is rollovered and can not be written to.\r\n\r\nIn the current logic, if it is found that the current ledger should be closed during the process of writing an entry, then the current ledger will be closed after this entry is written. However, if there is no pending add entry operation, a new ledger will not be created. **This will cause the current ledger to be unable to be deleted, and the retention policy cannot be executed as expected by the user.** This is the problem we need to solve, and I will further elaborate on this issue below:\r\n\r\n**We need to open a new ledger after the current ledger when it is rolled over.** In fact, Pulsar has a task that periodically checks if the ledger is full, and it will create a new ledger immediately after closing the ledger. Subsequently, the new ledger becomes the current ledger and the previous current ledger can be deleted.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/fc2e314c3560eb5011ab3e5e3ebf66fa0b9e6d4e/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/ManagedLedgerImpl.java#L4445-L4447\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/fc2e314c3560eb5011ab3e5e3ebf66fa0b9e6d4e/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/ManagedLedgerImpl.java#L1794-L1816\r\n**However, the ledger may also be closed after adding an entry, and at this time, if there is no pending add entry operation, a new ledger will not be created. Therefore, the already closed current ledger cannot be deleted because there is no new ledger to become the current ledger.**\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/fc2e314c3560eb5011ab3e5e3ebf66fa0b9e6d4e/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/OpAddEntry.java#L276\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/fc2e314c3560eb5011ab3e5e3ebf66fa0b9e6d4e/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/ManagedLedgerImpl.java#L1757-L1760\r\n\r\n**Fix2: slowestReaderPosition should be the next porsition of markdelete position instead of markdelete position**\r\nIn the current ledger the slowestReaderPosition will be the slowest markdeletepostion and this will make the last full ledger can not be trimed after all the entries in this ledger is acked.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/fc2e314c3560eb5011ab3e5e3ebf66fa0b9e6d4e/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/ManagedCursorImpl.java#L1369\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/fc2e314c3560eb5011ab3e5e3ebf66fa0b9e6d4e/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/ManagedCursorImpl.java#L2038-L2070\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/73f62c5aa88a9bb538278b6cf25ed920fe48c235/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/ManagedCursorContainer.java#L232-L261\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n**Fix1: Create new ledger after the current ledger is closed**\r\nWe have two ways to solve this problem:\r\n1. Do not skip the current ledger when trimming ledgers.\r\n2. Create a new ledger after the current ledger is closed and there are no pending add entry operations.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, users take more care about the write-read latency instead of the cost of storage brought by creating an empty ledger. So I suggest we delete the limit of `!pendingAddEntries.isEmpty()`, creating a new ledger after closing the current ledger.\r\n**Fix2: slowestReaderPosition should be the next porsition of markdelete position instead of markdelete position**\r\n\r\n Skip the ledger that has been read completed when trimming.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIf a consumer tries to subscribe to a partitioned topic with a suffix-matched regexp, it does not work.\r\n- create topic `persistent://public/default/tp`\r\n- create a consumer with regexp `persistent://public/default/tp$`\r\n- the pattern consumer has no internal consumers.\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce the issue by the test `testPreciseRegexpSubscribe`.\r\n- it can work when using `2.10.x`\r\n- it can not work when using `>=2.11.0`, it is a break change due to [PIP-145](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/14505)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21885 fixed one wrong logic [here](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21885/files#diff-a36b69990c877e8ddc805bab84f15c3b119d42e152ba137d17e02e6909b0089cR54-R58), but there is still another wrong logic, see https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/TopicListService.java#L64\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic void accept(String topicName, NotificationType notificationType) {\r\n    // The param \"topicName\" contains the partition suffix, which causes a suffix-matched regexp not to match.\r\n    if (topicsPattern.matcher(topicName).matches()) {\r\n        List<String> newTopics;\r\n        List<String> deletedTopics;\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Why can the test `testPreciseRegexpSubscribe` pass?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21885 added a test `testPreciseRegexpSubscribe` that covers the test which creates a consumer with a suffix-matched regexp. It works as below:\r\n- create a consumer with a suffix-matched regexp\r\n- create a partitioned topic\r\n- two events will trigger the pattern consumer to auto-create an internal single partition consumer.\r\n  - Start a new `recheckTopicsChangeAfterReconnect` after the topic watcher is connected. https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21885 fixed the wrong behavior.\r\n  - Receive an event that a new topic created. Current PR is trying to fix the wrong behavior.\r\n\r\nThe test `testPreciseRegexpSubscribe` can not pass as the below flow:\r\n- create a consumer with a suffix-matched regexp\r\n- wait for Topic List Watcher to start.\r\n  - the consumer will call `recheckTopicsChangeAfterReconnect` at this step.\r\n- create a partitioned topic\r\n  -  the consumer can not receive the event due to the wrong logic, then the test failed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n- Review all the codes of the Topic List Watcher and add descriptions of the `topic name`.\r\n- Fix the wrong behavior.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nFor some use case, the users need to store all the messages even though these message are acked by all subscription.\r\nSo they set the retention policy of the namespace to infinite

It makes the subscription stuck(just like the consumer receives messages but does not acknowledge them).\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n- Substitute new non-durable cursor for `subscription.cursor`\r\n- Rename the param `startCursorPosition` of `new NonDurableCursor` to `mdPosition`, make the code more clearer\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nI switched the log level from info to debug by the `pulsar.log.level` and `pulsar.log.root.level` values in the `log4j2.yaml` file, but there is no debug log for pulsar in the console.\r\n\r\nThe following is the log4j2 debug log(`LOG4J_DEBUG=true bin/pulsar standalone -nfw`):\r\n```\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger Watching configuration '/Users/zixuan/repo/pulsar/conf/log4j2.yaml'

StatusLogger createAppenderRef(ref=\"RoutingAppender\", level=\"INFO\", Filter=null)\r\n...\r\nDEBUG StatusLogger Started configuration YamlConfiguration[location=/Users/zixuan/repo/pulsar/conf/log4j2.yaml] OK.\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see the `RoutingAppender` uses the `INFO` level in the above log.\r\n\r\nIn the `bin/pulsar`, we use the system properties to set the log4j2 log level, and it looks higher priority than the `log4j2.yaml` file. \r\n\r\nWhen I remove the `PULSAR_LOG_LEVEL` and `PULSAR_LOG_ROOT_LEVEL` variables in the `bin/pulsar`, and then change the log level from info to debug in the `log4j2.yaml` file, it works fine.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nWhen the `PULSAR_LOG_LEVEL` or `PULSAR_LOG_ROOT_LEVEL` is set by the user, we set the log level by system properties. \r\n\r\n**Note:** This way doesn't support changing the log level by the `log4j2.yaml`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If the PR belongs to a PIP, please add the PIP link here -->\r\n\r\nPIP-337: Create a new SSL Factory Plugin to customize SSL Context and SSL Engine Generation\r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/README.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nApache Pulsar's TLS encryption configuration is not pluggable. It only supports file-based certificates. This makes \r\nPulsar difficult to adopt for organizations that require loading TLS certificates by other mechanisms.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

repository.\r\n\r\napache/pulsar pull requests should be first tested in your own fork since the \r\napache/pulsar CI based on GitHub Actions has constrained resources and quota.\r\nGitHub Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in \r\na forked repository.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be run in the forked repository until all PR review comments have\r\nbeen handled, the

Motivation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/21445 introduces an implicit requirement that if the topic policies cannot be loaded, `BrokerService#getTopic` will fail and then the client will retry loading the topic.\r\n\r\nIt could break some existing usages like the tests in the C++ client: https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-cpp/pull/394\r\n\r\nThis change is applied only to avoid the race condition when unloading a namespace bundle. However, the client should not fail if the topic-level policies are not available.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nIf the topic policies cannot be loaded due to a non-retryable error, we should not fail the `getTopic`. For retryable errors, the client will still retry until the broker gets the topic-level policies successfully after some attempts.\r\n\r\nModify `TokenAuthenticatedProducerConsumerTest` to protect the change.\r\n\r\n**Note: This PR also changes the `isRetriableError` semantics. To keep the compatibility, should we avoid this change?**\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

PrecisePublishLimiter also has the same issue.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n[pulsar-io-4-54] WARN  org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.ServerCnx - [/127.0.0.6:59173] Got exception java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Rate limiter is already shutdown\r\n at com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkArgument(Preconditions.java:145)\r\n at org.apache.pulsar.common.util.RateLimiter.tryAcquire(RateLimiter.java:176)\r\n at org.apache.pulsar.broker.resourcegroup.ResourceGroupPublishLimiter.tryAcquire(ResourceGroupPublishLimiter.java:138)\r\n at org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.AbstractTopic.isResourceGroupPublishRateExceeded(AbstractTopic.java:1036)\r\n at org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.ServerCnx.startSendOperation(ServerCnx.java:2611)\r\n at org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.ServerCnx.handleSend(ServerCnx.java:1508)\r\n at org.apache.pulsar.common.protocol.PulsarDecoder.channelRead(PulsarDecoder.java:207)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:444)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:420)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.fireChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:412)\r\n at io.netty.handler.flow.FlowControlHandler.dequeue(FlowControlHandler.java:200)\r\n at io.netty.handler.flow.FlowControlHandler.channelRead(FlowControlHandler.java:162)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:442)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:420)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.fireChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:412)\r\n at io.netty.handler.codec.ByteToMessageDecoder.fireChannelRead(ByteToMessageDecoder.java:346)\r\n at io.netty.handler.codec.ByteToMessageDecoder.fireChannelRead(ByteToMessageDecoder.java:333)\r\n at io.netty.handler.codec.ByteToMessageDecoder.callDecode(ByteToMessageDecoder.java:454)\r\n at io.netty.handler.codec.ByteToMessageDecoder.channelRead(ByteToMessageDecoder.java:290)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:444)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:420)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.fireChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:412)\r\n at io.netty.channel.DefaultChannelPipeline$HeadContext.channelRead(DefaultChannelPipeline.java:1410)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:440)\r\n at io.netty.channel.AbstractChannelHandlerContext.invokeChannelRead(AbstractChannelHandlerContext.java:420)\r\n at io.netty.channel.DefaultChannelPipeline.fireChannelRead(DefaultChannelPipeline.java:919)\r\n at io.netty.channel.epoll.AbstractEpollStreamChannel$EpollStreamUnsafe.epollInReady(AbstractEpollStreamChannel.java:800)\r\n at io.netty.channel.epoll.EpollEventLoop.processReady(EpollEventLoop.java:499)\r\n at io.netty.channel.epoll.EpollEventLoop.run(EpollEventLoop.java:397)\r\n at io.netty.util.concurrent.SingleThreadEventExecutor$4.run(SingleThreadEventExecutor.java:997)\r\n at io.netty.util.internal.ThreadExecutorMap$2.run(ThreadExecutorMap.java:74)\r\n at io.netty.util.concurrent.FastThreadLocalRunnable.run(FastThreadLocalRunnable.java:30)\r\n at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:829)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nIf the current RateLimiter is already shutdown, we only return true and print the info log. Due to [pip-322](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/pip-322.md)  refactor pulsar rate limiting on version 3.2, so we only need to fix versions before 3.2.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[PIP-320](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/pip-320.md)\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n[PIP-264](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/pip-264.md) laid out the foundation for switching our entire metrics pipeline to OpenTelemetry. [PIP-320](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pip/pip-320.md) describes the first step in this process, adding an SDK wrapper to instantiate an OpenTelemetry client with a couple of sane defaults for Pulsar brokers, proxies and function workers. This PR provides the implementation for the new wrapper.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Add new artifact `pulsar-otel-metrics-provider` to encapsulate the new `OpenTelemetryService`. Our immediate goal is to make the service available to the broker, proxy, and function worker. Putting this in a new artifact allows us to cherry-pick this dependency as needed. Alternatively, this could be moved to `pulsar-common`, but it would then leak into the clients as well, which are out of scope for now. For the desired out-of-the-box experience, this artifact additionally pulls in the OTLP and Prometheus exporter dependencies.\r\n- Add the `OpenTelemetryService` class as a wrapper for the safe instantiation of the OpenTelemetry SDK. It serves the following purposes:\r\n  - Disable OpenTelemetry by default. Can be overridden by the customer using environment variables or system properties.\r\n  - Adjust the default number of permissible attributes per `Meter` (called the cardinality limit) from 2000 to 10000.\r\n  - Add `pulsar.cluster` as a resource attribute (aka label) to all metrics emitted by this SDK instance. Note that this parameter cannot be null or empty. Many of the existing Proxy tests were not setting this value in their configuration and had to be adapted. This value can also be overridden by environment variables or system properties. \r\n  - With the SDK instantiated, provide access to OpenTelemetry `Meter` objects. These are used to emit the actual metrics.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added unit test for class `OpenTelemetryService`, including:\r\n    - `testClusterNameCannotBeEmpty`\r\n    - `testClusterNameCannotBeNull`\r\n    - `testResourceAttributesAreSet`\r\n    - `testIsInstrumentationNameSetOnMeter`\r\n    - `testMetricCardinality`\r\n    - `testLongCounter`: verifies basic integer counter metrics can be emitted\r\n    - `testServiceIsDisabledByDefault`\r\n  - Added integration test class `MetricsTest`, validating the entire end-to-end metrics pipeline for brokers, proxies, and function-workers, using both the in-process Prometheus exporter and remote OTLP collector. Separated to run in its own CI integration test target, as it did not naturally fit anywhere else.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n*If the box was checked, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n- [x] Dependencies (add or upgrade a dependency)\r\n  - OpenTelemetry SDK libraries\r\n  - OpenTelemetry SDK Autoconfigure Extension\r\n    - This references the OpenTelemetry logs and traces libraries, too, which we don't need.

Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, if only broker-level EntryFilters are used,  each topic will repeatedly load EntryFilters, which is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nIf only broker-level

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe server distribution assembly does not currently include artifact runtime dependencies, pulling only the compile dependencies instead. While this has not impacted the customers, a class loading issue can always crop up. This is what happened while importing OpenTelemetry dependencies related to PIP-320. OpenTelemetry itself marks its many dependencies as `runtime` (see, for instance, https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.opentelemetry/opentelemetry-exporter-otlp/1.34.1). Including each of them manually in our POM is both tedious and error-prone.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Reverts the dependency scope for the server assembly to the default value, `runtime`.\r\n- Manually excludes some of the libraries that would be needlessly pulled.\r\n- Allows `org.roaringbitmap-shims-0.9.44.jar` to be included in the assembly.\r\n- Removes assembly exclusion for `lombok` as it is not needed anymore.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing integration tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

to: #20131\r\n\r\nThe master branch has fixed the issue by https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19841( Since it will makes users can not receive the messages which created in mistake, we did not cherry-pick https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19841 into other branches, see detail https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19841)\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n#### Background of Admin API `PersistentTopics.createSubscription`\r\nIt works like this:\r\n1. createSubscription( `tp1` )\r\n2. is partitioned topic? \r\n  `no`: return subscriptions\r\n  `yes`: createSubscription(`tp1-partition-0`)....createSubscription(`tp1-partition-n`)\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n#### Background of the issue of `TopicName.getPartition(int index)`\r\n```java\r\nString partitionedTopic = \"tp1-partition-0-DLQ\";\r\n\r\nTopicName partition0 = partitionedTopic.getPartition(0);// Highlight: the partition0.toString() will be \"tp1-partition-0-DLQ\"(it is wrong).The correct value is \"tp1-partition-0-DLQ-partition-0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Issue\r\nTherefore, if there has a partitioned topic named `tp1-partition-0-DLQ`, the method `PersistentTopics.createSubscription` will works like this:\r\n1. call Admin API ``PersistentTopics.createSubscription(\"tp1-partition-0-DLQ\")`\r\n2. is partitioned topic? \r\n3. yes, call `TopicName.getPartition(0)` to get partition 0 and will get `tp1-partition-0-DLQ` , then loop to step-1.\r\n\r\nThen the infinite HTTP call `PersistentTopics.createSubscription` makes the broker crash.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n#### Quick fix(this PR does it)\r\nIf hits the issue which makes the topic name wrong, do not loop to step 1.\r\n\r\n#### Long-term fix\r\nThe PR https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19841 fixes the issue which makes the topic name wrong, and this PR will create unfriendly compatibility, and PIP 263 https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20033 will make compatibility good.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen a broker restarted, there is a case in\r\n`NamespaceService#findBrokerServiceUrl`:\r\n1. `ownershipCache.getOwnerAsync(bundle)` got an empty data, then `searchForCandidateBroker` will be called\r\n2. The broker itself was elected as the candidate broker.\r\n3. Meanwhile, the other broker has acquired the distributed lock of the bundle, then `ownershipCache.tryAcquiringOwnership` will fail with\r\n\r\n```java\r\nlookupFuture.completeExceptionally(new PulsarServerException(\r\n        \"Failed to acquire ownership for namespace bundle \" + bundle, exception));\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-cpp/pull/390 for the real world case.\r\n\r\nThen in `TopicLookupBase#handleLookupError`, this exception will be wrapped into a `ServiceNotReady` error to client.\r\n\r\nThis case happens very frequently in our production environment when a broker restarted. If there is a `PulsarClient` that has many producers or consumers, the connection will be closed, which results in many reconnections, which brings much pressure to the cluster.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nIn `handleLookupError`, check the `PulsarServerException` and unwrap the `CompletionException`. If the unwrapped exception is `MetadataStoreException`, return the `MetadataError` to avoid closing the connection at client side.\r\n\r\nAdd `testLookupConnectionNotCloseIfFailedToAcquireOwnershipOfBundle` to simulate the case and verify the socket won't be closed.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#21989\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThere could be cases that the health-check message is lost or the reader just can't read the expected message for any reason, which will result into the producers and

#21971\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nIn summary, `jackson-annotations:2.12.0` or later is now required for `pulsar-client 3.0.x`, and this also applies to versions `3.1.x` and `3.2.x`.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, `ConsumerBuilderImpl#subscribe` may become stuck without displaying any error message.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nModify the `whenComplete` to a combination of `thenAccept` and `exceptionally`.
