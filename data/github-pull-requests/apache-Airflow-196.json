fail.\r\n\r\nThere was an error in our scripts - when --force-pull-images\r\nwere used, the base python version was not updated to the\r\nlatest version even if there was a newer one and it caused our\r\nimages to bounce few times between two latest patchlevels\r\nwhen they were manually refreshed.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes it so that the base python image is always used\r\nwhen\r\n\r\na) FORCE_PULL_IMAGES is true or\r\nb) UPGRADE_TO_NEWER_DEPENDENCIES is != false\r\n\r\nThis will cause python upgrade in two cases:\r\n - when images are rebuilt with --force-pull-images locally\r\n -

form fields and custom form behavior for the Snowflake connection so it is more obvious to new users what fields need to be filled out. Also the doc_strings for the hook are updated to reflect the params along with helpful information using sphinx directives. I have categorized the fields below to explain the change.\r\n\r\nFields/inputs Used by the average user\r\n\r\n    Conn Id\r\n    Conn Type\r\n    Host\r\n    Schema\r\n    Login\r\n    Password\r\n    account\r\n    database\r\n    region\r\n\r\nFields/inputs not used by user\r\n\r\n    Port\r\n\r\nFields/inputs not used by user but reflected in code(not used by average user)\r\n\r\n    role\r\n    authenticator\r\n    private_key_field\r\n    session_parameters\r\n    aws_access_key_id\r\n    aws_secret_access_key(secret)\r\n\r\nProposal \r\n\r\n- Add fields used by the average user, remove fields not used by the users, and allow users to use extras for fields that are not used by average user unless the input is a secret because of #8766\r\n- Add fields for `aws_accces_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` because aws secret key is a secret \r\n- Add placeholders so users have a little more information on fields\r\n    ex.

Taskflow API is a very clean way to turn python functions into\r\nAirflow tasks, but it is currently limited to only running in the\r\nvirtualenv of the parent worker.

change was included in\r\nPython 3.8.8 to fix a vulnerability (bpo-42967)\r\n\r\nDepending on which Base Python Image is run in our CI, two of the tests\r\ncan fail or succeed.\r\n\r\nOur Previous two attempts:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/061cd236deb22567e4de36af11025f028d787989#\r\n- https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/49952e79b04da932242ebf3981883e591b467994\r\n\r\nWe might for a while get different base python version depending on the changes of a PR (whether or not it includes a change to dockerfiler).\r\na) when you have PR which do not have changes in the Dockerfile, they will use the older python version as base (for example Python 3.8.7)\r\nb) when you have PR that touches the Dockerfile and have setup.py changes in master, it should pull Python 3.8.8 first.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

up `tests/www` and `tests/api_connexion` by 64% and 37%, respectively. This was accomplished by removing slow and unnecessary initialization steps from test setups, as well as mocking slow login methods.\r\n\r\n# On Production\r\n`tests/www` has been reduced from 9:32 to 2:99.\r\n`tests/api_connextion` is down from 10:22 to 6:08.\r\n# Profiling\r\nThis PR is based on considerable profiling using pytest-profiling and the pytest `--durations` argument. Both tools were invaluable in determining the slowest test functions.\r\n\r\n## Slow Initialization\r\nWhenever `create_app` is called, multiple sub-modules are initialized, including permission roles, the old api, new api, logging, error handling, etc. Most of these are not relevant for many of the tests. This PR removes unnecessary initialization. \r\n\r\n## Slow login\r\nLogin functionality currently depends on hash functions to hash passwords. By mocking the password hashing functionality in we can sidestep this slowdown.\r\n\r\n### Approaches analyzed but not used\r\n1. Adding indexes to FAB permissions tables. FAB queries roles and permissions on unindexed name columns. Surprisingly, adding indexes didn't result in a meaningful test speedup.\r\n2. Caching api_connexion rendering. the `init_api_connexion` method is the slowest initialization method, but is required for all `api_connexion` methods. It looks like the Jinja rendering is the slowest part. I investigated storing the rendered API in an intermediate state in a separate file, but this wasn't feasible. If we want more speedups in the future, caching the api_connexion app, much like we cache the current flask app, is likely the biggest win.","created_at":"2021-03-09T16:11:34Z","updated_at":"2021-03-12T11:44:50Z","closed_at":"2021-03-12T11:36:04Z","merged_at":"2021-03-12T11:36:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"cdfa4ee8bf752ee14ae84868aa9ad4b6bc618102","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

This is done by storing the list of expanded group_ids in `localStorage`.\r\n\r\n## Previous behaviour:\r\nWhen the page is refreshed, the Graph View resets to the initial view (with all the TaskGroup collapsed by default).\r\n\r\n## Behaviour after this PR:\r\nWhen the page is refreshed, the Graph View expands previously expanded TaskGroups, and puts the previously focused TaskGroup back in focus.","created_at":"2021-03-08T13:35:09Z","updated_at":"2021-05-29T08:20:36Z","closed_at":"2021-03-12T15:11:58Z","merged_at":"2021-03-12T15:11:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"456a7ddfd1da797d493abd8a57d36d05424eaaa6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

Configuration view, and shows _only_ the rendered view, with the goal to remove confusion about which configuration is currently active.\r\n\r\nMy motivation is that I often encounter people not knowing that you can scroll down to see the active configuration, thinking the airflow.cfg (which is displayed first) is the configuration currently active (which are defaults that might be overridden by env vars).\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n\r\n- UI shows only rendered config\r\n- UI shows an info message in case `AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__EXPOSE_CONFIG=False`\r\n- Removed argument `raw=true`, this can be substituted by the Config endpoint of the REST API\r\n- Removed `pre_subtitle` (the ascii art thing + version)\r\n\r\nScreenshots of old & new behaviours:\r\n\r\n###

Mode\" wasn't functioning properly (obfuscating sensitive info). This update fixes the implementation so the Tree, Graph, and Code view blur contents as expected.\r\n\r\n- Refactored the instrumentation of the \"demo mode\" to use a global jinja variable instead of repeating individual view variables\r\n- Used more instructive variable naming. eg. `is_demo_mode` instead of `blur`.\r\n\r\n_Side note:_ I'm interested in the genesis of this feature, but wasn't able to track down a PR in my initial searching. Curious how widely something like this would actually be used—if it's worth the overhead?\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n|  <img width=\"1110\" alt=\"Image 2021-03-03 at 10 16 38 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/109906388-694f8d00-7c6e-11eb-8ecf-1a0d91424ebd.png\"> | <img width=\"1170\" alt=\"Image 2021-03-03 at 10 14 29 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/109906550-b469a000-7c6e-11eb-932c-c4fafd9b3200.png\">  |\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n|  <img width=\"581\" alt=\"Image 2021-03-03 at 10 16 53 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/109906386-6785c980-7c6e-11eb-896d-f29418387438.png\"> | <img width=\"753\" alt=\"Image 2021-03-03 at 10 14 13 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/109906418-73718b80-7c6e-11eb-8218-cd685f05eab8.png\">  |\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n|---|---|\r\n|  <img width=\"1246\" alt=\"Image 2021-03-03 at 10 17 10 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/109906380-63f24280-7c6e-11eb-84a2-4677b9bf0db7.png\"> |  <img width=\"1303\" alt=\"Image 2021-03-03 at 10 13 56 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/109906425-753b4f00-7c6e-11eb-92d5-a030836b5a2d.png\"> |\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-04T03:30:40Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T16:10:18Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T16:10:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9447b47814dd24fabed6ab92dcbb35c61ed8e87b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":1872841889,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODcyODQxODg5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/dont-merge","name":"dont-merge","color":"a9e8f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.
