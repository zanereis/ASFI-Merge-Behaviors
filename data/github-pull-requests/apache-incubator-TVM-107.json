PR adds LSTM support to the relay Onnx frontend. \r\n\r\nBesides adding the LSTM parser itself, we encountered an issue where for some Onnx operations (like LSTMs) arguments are optional. The current method for passing arguments to converters is just to pack them into a list however as some arguments are optional the position of each input is inconsistent. Instead, we should be using a dictionary mapping input names to their value. However, changing all inputs to a dictionary would require changing all the current operators and present problems with direct Onnx to relay conversions. Our workaround here is to add the `onnx_input` class that can be accessed as a list as we previously did or with input name dictionary style lookup.","created_at":"2020-02-06T01:26:14Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:55:47Z","closed_at":"2020-02-07T02:09:11Z","merged_at":"2020-02-07T02:09:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"75e9f5dc5978662bc4b8b9e14705fa32bd9e5231","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/475852a7100115bcd8ce1b70684d58302920f8bd","head":{"label":"jwfromm:onnx_lstm","ref":"onnx_lstm","sha":"475852a7100115bcd8ce1b70684d58302920f8bd","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

function is used by both graph codegen and vm, so far they are using duplicated, identical implementations.\r\n\r\n On the graph codegen side, the function was pulled out of `RelayBuildModule` class and became a free function in #4751. I noticed that VM compiler is using the identical function, so I moved `BindParamByName` to backend/utils.h so that it can be used by VM as well.\r\n\r\nplease review @wweic @icemelon9 @jroesch

is a potential fix for #4758 \r\n\r\nI found out what causes the issue.  The module I test with has two CallNode expressions that reference the match clause: `%5 = @fn(%4);` and  `add(%2, %5)`.\r\n\r\nOne of these uses the GlobalVarNode path at line https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/src/relay/backend/vm/inline_primitives.cc#L94 which doesn't visit its arguments but just uses them directly from the original expression.\r\n\r\nThe other uses the default path at the end of the CallNode visitor which does visit its arguments, clones the match and uses it for the new call node it returns.\r\n\r\nMy fix is to always visit the arguments so that all path use the same \"version\" of the expressions.","created_at":"2020-01-28T18:31:24Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T02:33:40Z","closed_at":"2020-01-30T02:33:40Z","merged_at":"2020-01-30T02:33:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"6798ba80d288e7c6132b30606b3cb70812579fe8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4783/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4783/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4783/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c28fdd56b72c85431b08c9240e1a7b123ad7b42a","head":{"label":"abergeron:fix_inline_primitives","ref":"fix_inline_primitives","sha":"c28fdd56b72c85431b08c9240e1a7b123ad7b42a","user":{"login":"abergeron","id":1002504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron","html_url":"https://github.com/abergeron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109173485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkxNzM0ODU=","name":"tvm","full_name":"abergeron/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abergeron","id":1002504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron","html_url":"https://github.com/abergeron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abergeron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abergeron/tvm","description":"End

discussed [here](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/cross-compilation-ubuntu-for-tvm-generation-and-windows-for-executing-in-tvm-runtime/159/5), `hasattr` is currently broken for Windows. When a `Expr` does not have an attribute, a `TVMError` is thrown rather than an `AttributeError`. This is because of how we extract the error type from the logged message.\r\n\r\nOn Unix, DMLC will log the stack trace when `LOG(FATAL)` is called. However, DMLC will not log the stack trace on Windows.

have both Python and C++ implementation of upsampling op. Until recently the C++ implementation was being used by NNVM, but now that NNVM is gone, we should remove it. \r\n\r\nOtherwise it only creates [confusion](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/topi-operator-upsampling-in-c-vs-upsampling-in-python/5488). There was a time when people tried to port python topi to c++ to reduce dependency on python. But nowadays it doesn't seem to be the focus of people.\r\n\r\nThe situation of resize is similar but worse. People added more functionality to python resize (more coordinate transform, bicubic, crop_and_resize etc.) and nobody updated the c++ version.\r\n\r\nWe can also discuss if we want to remove upsampling op entirely, since it just forwards to the resize op. Historically, upsampling was first added in #772 as one of \"the standard neural network operators\". But later somebody added resize op to support Tensorflow's image operation. I thought (and still think) it is weird to introduce \"image\" operations inside network, but by now ONNX also deprecated Upsampling in favor of Resize, so this seems to be the standard. (Although people claim Resize is more general than Upsampling, it's funny pretty much most use cases for Resize is to do upsampling).\r\n\r\nplease review @vinx13 @jwfromm @yzhliu @icemelon9

up #4344 . Previous PR solves OpenCV + TVM slow performance and AutoTVM Python CPU affinity problem. However, previous PR has two problem:\r\n\r\n- doesn't solve ARM  BIG.LITTLE heterogeneous multicores.\r\n   For example, we have 2xA72 + 4xA53, previous pr will add all cpu to CPU SET even we call `config_thread_pool` to restrict TVM runs on 4 little cores. So, TVM_MASTER_THREAD could run A72 big core. This is not we want.\r\n   Solution: we should restrict master in the little cpus or big cpus according to users's setting.\r\n- Not all Linux variant OS has `pthread_atfork`. For example, Alibaba's AliOS doesn't have this api.\r\n   Solution: unified android and linux's way. We will call `SetFullCpuAffinity` if we don't have `TVM_BIND_MASTER_THREAD`.\r\n\r\n@tqchen @yidawang @vinx13 @ajtulloch Could you help to review it?
