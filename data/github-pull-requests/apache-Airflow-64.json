certain scenarios, tasks utilizing the KubernetesPodOperator may encounter failures due to insufficient resource requests from the pod. Conversely, there are instances where Airflow requests an excessive amount of resources, leading to Kubernetes struggling to find available space on its nodes.\r\n\r\nThis modification aims to provide Airflow developers with more flexibility regarding pod resources. In the event of task failure, this new parameter allows for a \"second chance\" by enabling the use of different container resources with the KubernetesPodOperator. This ensures a more adaptive and more resilient execution for Airflow tasks.","created_at":"2024-02-09T19:06:18Z","updated_at":"2024-02-12T04:23:09Z","closed_at":"2024-02-10T08:48:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff4a2311293f15afe39564feedbd02cfea9e9f7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2504183113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTA0MTgzMTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:cncf-kubernetes","name":"provider:cncf-kubernetes","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Kubernetes

PR provides a workaround solution for the issue #35833.\r\n\r\nIt is really necessary because users are unable to use `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` in deferrable mode in regions other than `EU`, `US` or `us-central1`. This fix was provided now because there is no response neither from `gcloud-aio` nor `google-cloud-bigquery` regarding their plans for providing async [get_job](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/get) method with the optional `location` parameter.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution:\r\n1. The `BigQueryAsyncHook` wraps the call of the synchronous method `BigQueryAsyncHook.get_job()` in `asyncio.loop.run_in_executor()`.\r\n2. The optional parameter `location` is passed from the `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` to the `BigQueryInsertJobTrigger`, where it is handed to the hook.\r\n3. Because the `BigQueryInsertJobTrigger` is a parent class for other four triggers (see below), they were updated in order to comply with the base class attributes.\r\n```\r\nBigQueryCheckTrigger,\r\nBigQueryGetDataTrigger,\r\nBigQueryIntervalCheckTrigger,\r\nBigQueryValueCheckTrigger\r\n```\r\n4. Despite the modification, triggers from (3) and all the operators that use these triggers and changed async method `BigQueryAsyncHook.get_job_status()`  don;t change behavior because the optional parameter `location` is ignored there. However, it would be very nice to fix them too and test carefully in a separated PR:\r\n```\r\nBigQueryCheckOperator,\r\nBigQueryGetDataOperator,\r\nBigQueryIntervalCheckOperator,\r\nBigQueryValueCheckOperator,\r\nBigQueryTablePartitionExistenceSensor,\r\nBigQueryToGCSOperator,\r\nGCSToBigQueryOperator\r\n```\r\n\r\ncloses:

current state of the KubernetesPodOperator (KPO) \r\nonly prints container logs at the end of task execution.\r\nWhile this is sufficient for short-running tasks,\r\nit becomes less user-friendly when the container runs for an extended period.\r\nThis PR enhances the KPO by modifying the trigger and operator\r\nto fetch container logs periodically\r\nmaking it possible to monitor the task's progress in the Airflow task UI.\r\n\r\na new parameter have been introduced to the operator:\r\n- logging_interval: This parameter specifies the maximum time, \r\n   in seconds, that the task should remain deferred before resuming to fetch the latest logs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

 This is a draft so I can get some help, it includes some debug prints, etc which will be removed.\r\n\r\nI wanted to add a banner to the UI for when the executor is unhealthy, similar to the existing banner for \"The scheduler does not appear to be running.\"  The debug log messages show that executor.is_healthy is updating as expected, but the banner is only getting loaded (or not) based on the initial state of he executor, which means that when executor.is_healthy updates, it does not trigger the main.html code block to get refreshed.  The banner for the scheduler gets displayed automatically when the scheduler process is killed, so I am missing something that links the executor.is_healthy value change, I think?    Any suggestions? \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This update ensures continued functionality as Airbyte intends to discontinue the Configuration API, which this provider perviously used to interact with Airbyte.\r\n\r\nThe discussion in issue #35011 mentioned two possible considerations when implementing a fix:\r\n\r\n1. Use Airbyte's official [Python SDK](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte-api-python-sdk) \r\n2. Continue using the Configuration API too, for those running Airbyte v0.4x releases.\r\n\r\n**[Airbyte's API Python SDK]**: The changes in this PR do not use the official Python SDK. This SDK is still in beta. Furthermore, I wanted to keep the changes lightweight and not add another dependency, especially considering the Airbyte Airflow provider only uses 4 of Airbyte's API endpoints.\r\n\r\n**[Dual API Support]**:The change removes support for the Configuration API. It would have been cumbersome to support both API's. Those who are running an older version of Airbyte can install an older version of this provider when setting up Airflow.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting, I have tested the changes in this PR on my production Airflow deployment to verify the code works.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR fixes: #27488.\r\n\r\nIt solves the timeout error when trying to synchronize large files by using the `rewrite` function instead of `copy`.\r\n\r\nThere was also previously a bug when synchronizing from a subdirectory where an empty subdirectory gets created which is solved by this PR. \r\nFor e.g synchronizing files in subdirectory `bigdata2` from source bucket would unnecessarily create an empty `bigdata2` folder as seen in the image. This should not happen if I understand the [docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/stable/operators/transfer/gcs_to_gcs.html#synchronize-from-a-subdirectory) correctly.\r\n\r\n![airflow_pr4](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/8247966/646d365b-3289-4511-a97a-34b767fd7aa4)\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of GCSSynchronizeBucketsOperator otherwise remains the same.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

We intend to bring [Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc?hl=en) as a managed service offering to GDC.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, we need to integrate Airflow with Dataproc on GDC API resources to trigger Apache Spark workloads. The integration needs to cover two distinct API paths: local execution through the KRM API and remote execution through an equivalent One Platform API. We're targeting the former one in this PR i.e. Airflow operator leveraging KRM APIs.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains two feature implementations :\r\n1. An Airflow operator can submit a SparkApplication via the KRM API, enabling customers to use Airflow to orchestrate Dataproc on GDC workloads locally. \r\n2. An Airflow operator can create an ApplicationEnvironment via both the KRM API.\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37199#issuecomment-1930704459\r\n\r\nSeems like `inspect.signature(CLASS)` works a different in python 3.8 and 3.9+.\r\nIf directly pass class then it always returns params signature as\r\n```console\r\nmappingproxy(OrderedDict([('args', <Parameter \"*args\">), ('kwds', <Parameter \"**kwds\">)]))\r\n```\r\nWhich is always pass in current test case.\r\n\r\nIf compare to Python 3.9+ it returns \r\n```console\r\nmappingproxy(OrderedDict([('s3_bucket', <Parameter \"s3_bucket: 'str | None' = None\">), ('job_name', <Parameter \"job_name: 'str | None' = None\">), ('desc', <Parameter \"desc: 'str | None' = None\">), ('concurrent_run_limit', <Parameter \"concurrent_run_limit: 'int' = 1\">), ('script_location', <Parameter \"script_location: 'str | None' = None\">), ('retry_limit', <Parameter \"retry_limit: 'int' = 0\">), ('num_of_dpus', <Parameter \"num_of_dpus: 'int | float | None' = None\">), ('iam_role_name', <Parameter \"iam_role_name: 'str | None' = None\">), ('iam_role_arn', <Parameter \"iam_role_arn: 'str | None' = None\">), ('create_job_kwargs', <Parameter \"create_job_kwargs: 'dict | None' = None\">), ('update_config', <Parameter \"update_config: 'bool' = False\">), ('job_poll_interval', <Parameter \"job_poll_interval: 'int | float' = 6\">), ('args', <Parameter \"*args\">), ('kwargs', <Parameter \"**kwargs\">)]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR intend to use signature of `__init__` constructor, and result will be same regardless of python interpreter version\r\n```console\r\nmappingproxy(OrderedDict([('self', <Parameter \"self\">), ('s3_bucket', <Parameter \"s3_bucket: 'str | None' = None\">), ('job_name', <Parameter \"job_name: 'str | None' = None\">), ('desc', <Parameter \"desc: 'str | None' = None\">), ('concurrent_run_limit', <Parameter \"concurrent_run_limit: 'int' = 1\">), ('script_location', <Parameter \"script_location: 'str | None'

when deploying multiple releases that share the same release name in **different** namespaces deployment is failing due to a naming clash of the cluster-scoped RBAC resources.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changes that make sure that `ClusterRole`s and `ClusterRoleBinding`s are uniquely named according to both the release name, as well as the release namespace, thus solving the naming clash.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce current behavior:\r\n1. Create namespace `airflow-a`\r\n2. Install helm chart release named `airflow` into namespace `airflow-a` with `multiNamespaceMode: true`\r\n3. Create namespace `airflow-b`\r\n4. Install helm chart release named `airflow` into namespace `airflow-b` with `multiNamespaceMode: true`\r\n5. Installing the helm chart will fail due to a naming clash of the cluster-wide RBAC resources\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Why\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/36618, a user asked for a way to delete DatasetDagRunQueue and devised a workaround that directly manipulated the airflow database. Thus, in this PR, I'm trying to create API endpoints to provide a way to do so without the user needing to directly manipulate the DB\r\n\r\n## What \r\nAdd the following API endpoints to get/delete `DatasetDagRunQueue` with an argument `before`, which allows users to filter only the `DatasetDagRunQueue` created before this time.\r\n\r\n* `DELETE /dags/{dag_id}/datasets/queuedEvent/{uri}`\r\n* `DELETE /dags/{dag_id}/datasets/queuedEvent`\r\n* `DELETE /datasets/queuedEvent/{uri}`\r\n* `GET /dags/{dag_id}/datasets/queuedEvent/{uri}`\r\n* `GET /dags/{dag_id}/datasets/queuedEvent`\r\n* `GET /datasets/queuedEvent/{uri}`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

However, when we return a list of tuples, the tuples get serialized as lists. The [above condition is false](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/46470aba68e5ebeee24a03dc22d012a50ee287ad/airflow/utils/json.py#L101), and we fallback to the default json encoding behavior. Thus, the way namedtuple / tuple are handled is inconsistent.\r\n\r\nThis causes some queries of the Databricks Hook and Operator to fail right now, depending on how the Hook / Operator are parameterized.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix the namedtuple for such queries, but it doesn't fix the inconsistency: sometimes namedtuple will be encoded as dict, sometimes as list. IMO a definitive fix involve another strategy than [`qualname()`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/46470aba68e5ebeee24a03dc22d012a50ee287ad/airflow/utils/module_loading.py#L47). Because namedtuples have dynamic qualnames, wich will never be \"builtins.tuple\".\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead
