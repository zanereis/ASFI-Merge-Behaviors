using Alex's version of RMSProp to train a network, I found it sometimes update some network weights to NaN.\r\nAfter that, I found the RMSProp implementation is a little bit different from [Alex's paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850v5.pdf). In equation 40, the epsilon should be under the square root.\r\n\r\nI guess I got `NaN` because `state_n - state_g * state_g` can sometimes be something like `-1e-20` (because of floating point arithmetic error). Indeed, after I applied this patch, it stops update network weights to `NaN`.","created_at":"2017-05-13T13:37:26Z","updated_at":"2017-05-13T21:53:25Z","closed_at":"2017-05-13T21:53:25Z","merged_at":"2017-05-13T21:53:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"38f7c5584016e92ba1e0ee1b00ea6632740f67ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6235/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/6235/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/6235/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a8d614c5885dccb6d7f71a03708150266f403c69","head":{"label":"sifmelcara:fix/rmsprop","ref":"fix/rmsprop","sha":"a8d614c5885dccb6d7f71a03708150266f403c69","user":{"login":"sifmelcara","id":10496191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk2MTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10496191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara","html_url":"https://github.com/sifmelcara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":91175089,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MTE3NTA4OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sifmelcara/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sifmelcara","id":10496191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk2MTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10496191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara","html_url":"https://github.com/sifmelcara","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sifmelcara/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sifmelcara/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
