SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nNow the Python logging formatter does not apply correctly. This is because there was already `root logger` hander before this code was executed.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/a4fd6b8f33e9e780084a71f3e5b579468cdd635b/superset/utils/logging_configurator.py#L54-L55\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to solve this problem.\r\n1. Instance logger as early as possible\r\n2. add `force` argument to  `logging.basicConfig`. https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.basicConfig\r\n\r\nThis PR uses the first.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n[Update the GeoJSON of country maps](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1045) with the latest [Natural Earth data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) ([public domain usage](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/)) and fix a bunch of usability issues with this viz type.\r\n\r\nHow the GeoJSON files was generated can be found [here](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/eaf332bb7d28484de1609ac72466148c5c9c3c4c/plugins/legacy-plugin-chart-country-map/scripts/Country%20Map%20GeoJSON%20Generator.ipynb).\r\n\r\nThis should fix https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/4568 (dup https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/11666),  provide a better solution for https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/12987 and supersedes https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/955 .\r\n\r\nAlso updated the controls of the Country Map viz to move the required field \"Country\" out of \"Chart Options\" and converted all select option values to lowercase (for simplicity and consistency).\r\n\r\nIncludes a light weight db migration that runs on all Country Map visualizations. It should be very fast as this is not a very popular visualization type.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1353\" alt=\"UK map - before\"

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a chart emits cross-filter, the filter is applied to the chart-emitter. The result is that the user cannot add another value to that filter, because every value other than the current filter had been filtered out. This PR prevents the chart from applying a filter to itself, by adding it's ID to `excluded` array.\r\nTo test, enable the flag `DASHBOARD_CROSS_FILTERS`, go to USA Birth Names dashboard (from sample data), enable cross filtering for pie chart and try to emit a cross filter.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThanks to @betodealmeida's work in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13960, it was pretty trivial to get the new chart data API returning the SIP-40 style error payloads. This PR also refactors the SupersetErrorException a bit to support passing in a SupersetError, naming help for the other exception type would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nNew unit test, verify that the same error messages are returned when accessing data in a nvd3 line chart and the new table chart and pie chart.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new error `TEST_CONNECTION_INVALID_USERNAME_ERROR`, for when the username provided to connect to a given database is invalid.\r\n\r\nIt also removes the `_diagnose` method, which tests if the host is up or down, leveraging `extract_errors` for that instead. I implemented the functionality for Postgres, and will implement in other popular engines in a next PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n- Migrates the `Slider` component from Bootstrap to AntD\r\n- Creates a storybook entry for `Slider`\r\n- Removes `ReactBootstrapSlider`\r\n\r\nPS: No tests were added because we don't add any custom behavior to the component. Relying on AntD tests.\r\n\r\nSee: #10254\r\n\r\n@mihir174 I didn't found the `Slider` component in the North Star specification so I used AntD default, which I think fits very well with our theme. Let me know if we need to change it.\r\n\r\n@rusackas @junlincc @pkdotson \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"357\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-07 at 8 41 49 AM\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR implements native filter and cross filter API simplification efforts introduced in https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1040 and https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1053 . The following changes are done:\r\n\r\n1. `setDataMask` hook now has new structure:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   filterState: { value: any, ...otherProps: any }\r\n   ownState: { ...otherProps: any }\r\n   extraFormData: ExtraFormData\r\n}\r\n```\r\n1. Nested `append_form_data` and `override_form_data` fields in `ExtraFormData` type are moved up one level into the main filter object\r\n1. `currentValue` removed from formData now it passed in props.filterState.value\r\n1. In SuperChart injected `ownState` and `filterState`\r\n1. Fixed bug when remove cross filter from dashboard it's wasn't from dashboard metadata\r\n1. Fixed bug that `filter_select` was attached to filterBoxes\r\n1. Fixed bug that when user just added cross filter without setting, it's scoping filter not appeared in filter badge\r\n1. migrate old filter set metadata to new format\r\n1. upgrade Python code for legacy charts that depend on `viz.py`\r\n\r\nAffected areas:\r\n1. Native filters\r\n2. Cross filters\r\n3. Own state of charts\r\n4. Filter sets\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nAll frontend + backend unit tests have been updated, and a test for the migration has been added to ensure that both up and down migrations produce expected results.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [x] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [x] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [x] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [x] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided: only affects dashboards with filter sets.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13956. More specifically the issue with \"caching\" the the dataset health check message (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/11970) on the associated datasource record was that if the callback was defined, the first time a user when to explorer the record was updated with the callback response where the user was defined as the updater.\r\n\r\nAdditionally tying the health check solely to the metadata of the datasource is likely too restrictive, i.e., it seems plausible that an institution may want to have custom logic which actually introspects the underlying data. Hence the fix was to remove the caching on the datasource record and instead place on ownership on the institution to write the necessary logic for memoizing the callback (which includes the specific datasource as an argument).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

details on configuring Docker Compose. Closes #13957\r\n\r\nAlso updated some things I noticed on the way (e.g. Windows WSL + Docker, the `latest` tag doesn't have the `docker-compose-non-dev.yml` in the same place, the next page is not about connecting a DB driver)\r\n\r\nI also have a potential other section to add, which I've included here for discussion (it's more a WIP, and I don't know how much is useful/should be on the main installation page):\r\n\r\n#### Debugging Docker Compose\r\n\r\nIf you don't make any changes to the configuration described above, you shouldn't run into any issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are tweaking the setup, `docker-compose down -v` will remove the volumes associated with the Superset containers. \r\n\r\nYou can choose whether to do this\r\n1. If you do and you have examples enabled it may take a while to re-load them.\r\n2. If you don't: you can run into issues where the service has written to the volume and is in an unmanageable state (e.g. the permissions and users in the DB are messed up, or there's a `service_name.pid` file somewhere so the service errors saying it's running)\r\n\r\nDocker-compose has sometimes treated volumes marked `external` differently, so you may need to investigate whether they are actually removed.","created_at":"2021-04-06T04:32:35Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T22:49:28Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T22:04:14Z","merged_at":"2021-04-12T22:04:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"5952d78121d62baafa5cb608f90cc8d7e66c8211","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR is a first step in making the v1 API compatible with [SIP-40](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9194) and [SIP-41](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9298).\r\n\r\nCurrently, the API returns exceptions using helper methods from Flask-AppBuilder, eg:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        try:\r\n            TestConnectionDatabaseCommand(g.user, item).run()\r\n            return self.response(200, message=\"OK\")\r\n        except DatabaseTestConnectionFailedError as ex:\r\n            return self.response_422(message=str(ex))\r\n        except SupersetErrorException as ex:\r\n            return self.response(ex.status, message=ex.error.message)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese responses are simple JSON payloads, not compatible with the standard error format introduced in SIP-40. For example, when adding a database with a non-existent driver (`foo://`) this is returned:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"message\": \"Could not load database driver: BaseEngineSpec\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is the message displayed in the frontend (in a toast):\r\n\r\n> ERROR: Could not load database driver: BaseEngineSpec\r\n\r\nTo conform with SIP-41 I added <del>a new decorator called `handle_exception`</del> <ins>an error handler</ins> that captures exceptions and formats them according to SIP-40. This allows us to simplify the API logic, removing the need to capture exceptions when running commands (see the [new `test_connection` method](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13960/files#diff-f9deb9b63f5f2db38b811ff092cf90b0d4d558223f743bbbb5b203c203d2d590L607-L613) in this PR).\r\n\r\nWith the decorator, the backend now returns:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"errors\": [\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"message\": \"Could not load database driver: BaseEngineSpec\",\r\n\t\t\t\"error_type\": \"GENERIC_COMMAND_ERROR\",\r\n\t\t\t\"level\": \"error\",\r\n\t\t\t\"extra\": {\r\n\t\t\t\t\"issue_codes\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"code\": 1010,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"message\": \"Issue 1010 - Superset found an error while running a command.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the message is displayed correctly in the frontend as before, in a toast, without requiring any modifications:\r\n\r\n> ERROR: Could not load database driver: BaseEngineSpec\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe current service definition for the web app in `docker-compose-non-dev.yml` uses the default entrypoint for the container which skips over installing the packages listed in `docker/requirements-local.txt`. This PR fixes that issue by adding another variant to the `docker-bootstrap.sh` script to run the default entrypoint script after packages have been installed. \r\nNote: setting the user as `root` is necessary in order to install packages. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-non-dev.yml up` and confirm:\r\n  - packages listed in `docker/requirements-local.txt` are installed on container boot\r\n  - the web app is being served by gunicorn. \r\n  \r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe new CLI for import/export is not working correctly with ZIP files (see https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13914). When exporting a dataset or dashboard, the default output file name is `dashboard_export_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS` (sic), while it should (1) have the `.zip` extension and (2) have an actual timestamp instead of the string \"YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS\".\r\n\r\nImport is also broken for the new format, even with the `VERSIONED_EXPORT` feature flag on it assumes that the input file is the old YAML/JSON format used for datasets and dashboards, respectively. I fixed it by using the same logic as the API, inspecting the file to see if a ZIP file and unbundling it if that's the case.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n1. Ran `superset export-dashboards`\r\n2. Deleted all charts\r\n3. Deleted all dashboards\r\n4. Ran `superset import-dashboards -p dashboard_export_20210401T132948.zip`\r\n5. Dashboards were imported correctly\r\n\r\nDid the same with datasets (exported datasets; deleted all dashboards, charts, datasets; imported datasets).\r\n\r\nAlso added unit tests covering import/export with the feature flag on and off.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nOops! Erroneously merged this to a feature branch instead of master. Ugh. \r\nSee https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13884 for a history/comments, and prior approvals.\r\n\r\nA recent PR, #13723, made some changes around how the sidebar works for the native filter features. This looks great when the feature flag is on, but when the feature flag is off, we lose the left margin, as reported in #13863. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure the styling is consistent, by considering feature flag setting, and only toggling off `dashboardFiltersOpen` (which sets the margin) when the feature is indeed enabled.\r\n\r\n@simcha90 if you have a more elegant way to tackle this, or ideas for sufficient testing to cover this possible regression, please let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBEFORE

This looks great when the feature flag is on, but when the feature flag is off, we lose the left margin, as reported in #13863. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure the styling is consistent, by considering feature flag setting, and only toggling off `dashboardFiltersOpen` (which sets the margin) when the feature is indeed enabled.\r\n\r\n@simcha90 if you have a more elegant way to tackle this, or ideas for sufficient testing to cover this possible regression, please let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBEFORE

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis fixes #13378 by ensuring that Flask's global object `g` contains a `user` object set to the user who initiated the request when queries are executing asynchronously. There is currently some deeply buried code that expects this when constructing the query. This is not a particularly robust fix, so if anyone has any suggestions I'd be very interested in hearing them. Ideally, we'd have a way to explicitly pass the username to where it's needed for impersonation configuration (like SQL lab does), but this would require a substantial amount of changes as far as I can tell. Even if refactoring that is the goal, I think we should get this out to unblock folks first.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nThis is difficult to test well, so the unit tests were updated to ensure a function is called that I manually tested. This is not a great test, and I almost omitted it altogether, but ended up including it. Let me know if you have suggestions.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to test this end-to-end but I don't have that environment setup yet. I'm going to work to get this set up. In the meantime, @juneauwang and @gorcurek if you're able to pull this branch down and test it, that would be lovely.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"
