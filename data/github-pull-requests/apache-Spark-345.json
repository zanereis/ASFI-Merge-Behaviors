What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark-submit support jar url with http protocol. However, if the url contains any query strings, `worker.DriverRunner.downloadUserJar()` method will throw \"Did not see expected jar\" exception. This is because this method checks the existance of a downloaded jar whose name contains query strings. This is a problem when your jar is located on some web service which requires some additional information to retrieve the file.\n\nThis pr just removes query strings before checking jar existance on worker.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nFor now, you can only test this patch by manual test.\n- Deploy a spark cluster locally\n- Make sure apache httpd service is on\n- Save an uber jar, e.g spark-job.jar under `/var/www/html/`\n- Use http://localhost/spark-job.jar?param=1 as jar url when running `spark-submit`\n- Job should be launched\n","created_at":"2016-10-10T13:43:58Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T11:54:16Z","closed_at":"2016-10-14T11:54:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ace62de99637b04a8dd816ab1cad462928859b29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15420/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15420/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15420/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2fade47798b43b954967a66579b6383239ee14d8","head":{"label":"invkrh:spark-17855","ref":"spark-17855","sha":"2fade47798b43b954967a66579b6383239ee14d8","user":{"login":"invkrh","id":5421623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjE2MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5421623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh","html_url":"https://github.com/invkrh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36795079,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjc5NTA3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"invkrh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"invkrh","id":5421623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjE2MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5421623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh","html_url":"https://github.com/invkrh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/invkrh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/invkrh/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we have several tens of test sqls in catalyst will fail at `SimpleAnalyzer.checkAnalysis`, we should make sure they are valid.\n\nThis PR makes the following changes:\n1. Apply `checkAnalysis` on plans that tests `Optimizer` rules, but don't require the testcases for `Parser`/`Analyzer` pass `checkAnalysis`;\n2. Fix testcases for `Optimizer` that would have fall.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nApply `SimpleAnalyzer.checkAnalysis` on plans in `PlanTest.comparePlans`, update invalid test

above code for example, prior #10677, the bit mask for set \"(a)\" was `001`, while after #10677 the bit mask was changed to `011`.

Then we can use the association rules to predict with other records.\r\n\r\n![drawing1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7981698/22489294/76b9302c-e7cb-11e6-8d2d-3fc53f407b2f.png)\r\n\r\n**For reviewers**, Let's first decide if the current `transform` function meets your expectation.\r\n\r\nCurrent options:\r\n\r\n1. Current implementation: Use Estimator and Transformer pattern in ML, the `transform` function will examine the input items against all the association rules and summarize the consequents. Users can also access frequent items and association rules via other model members.\r\n\r\n2. Keep the Estimator and Transformer pattern. But AssociationRulesModel and FPGrowthModel will have empty `transform` function, meaning DataFrame has no change after transform. But users can access frequent items and association rules via other model members.\r\n\r\n3. (mentioned by @zhengruifeng) Keep the Estimator and Transformer pattern. But `FPGrowthModel` and `AssociationRulesModel` will just return frequent itemsets and association rules DataFrame in the `transform` function. Meaning the resulting DataFrame after `transform` will not be related to the input DataFrame.\r\n\r\n4. Discard the Estimator and Transformer pattern. Both FPGrowth and FPGrowthModel will directly extend from PipelineStage, thus we don't need to have a `transform` function.\r\n\r\n I'd like to hear more concrete suggestions. I would prefer option 1 or 2.\r\n\r\nupdate 2:\r\n\r\nAs discussed  in the jira, we will not expose AssociationRules as a public API for now. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCopy `GaussianMixture` implementation from mllib to ml, then we can add new features to it.\r\nI left mllib `GaussianMixture` untouched, unlike some other algorithms to wrap the ml implementation. For the following reasons:\r\n- mllib `GaussianMixture` allows k == 1, but ml does not.\r\n- mllib `GaussianMixture` supports setting initial model, but ml does not support currently. (We will definitely add this feature for ml in the future)\r\n\r\nWe can get around these issues to make mllib as a wrapper calling into ml, but I'd prefer to leave mllib untouched which can make ml clean.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, There is a big performance improvement for `GaussianMixture` in this PR. Since the covariance matrix of multivariate gaussian distribution is symmetric, we can only store the upper triangular part of the matrix and it will greatly reduce the shuffled data size. In my test, this change will reduce shuffled data size by about 50% and accelerate the job execution.\r\n\r\nBefore this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen I was creating the example code for SPARK-10496, I realized it was pretty convoluted to define the frame boundaries for window functions when there is no partition column or ordering column. The reason is that we don't provide a way to create a WindowSpec directly with the frame boundaries. We can trivially improve this by adding rowsBetween and rangeBetween to Window object.\n\nAs an example, to compute cumulative sum using the natural ordering, before this pr:\n\n```\ndf.select('key, sum(\"value\").over(Window.partitionBy(lit(1)).rowsBetween(Long.MinValue, 0)))\n```\n\nAfter this pr:\n\n```\ndf.select('key, sum(\"value\").over(Window.rowsBetween(Long.MinValue, 0)))\n```\n\nNote that you could argue there is no point specifying a window frame without partitionBy/orderBy -- but it is strange that only rowsBetween and rangeBetween are not the only two APIs not available.\n\nThis also fixes https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17656 (removing _root_.scala).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases to compute cumulative sum in DataFrameWindowSuite for Scala/Java and tests.py for Python.\n","created_at":"2016-10-10T01:18:22Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T05:35:29Z","closed_at":"2016-10-11T05:35:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7611c80f9fc6ee109d3cfc66aede4498e0e8d70a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15412/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15412/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15412/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e14186836a6aecbc58839edffa57213869271b91","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-17844","ref":"SPARK-17844","sha":"e14186836a6aecbc58839edffa57213869271b91","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nHistory Server UI's application listing to display information on currently under process event logs so a user knows that pending this processing an application may not list on the UI.\n\nWhen there are no event logs under process, the application list page has a \"Last Updated\" date-time at the top indicating the date-time of the last _completed_ scan of the event logs. The value is displayed to the user in his/her local time zone.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAll unit tests pass.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn PySpark, the invalid join type will not throw error for the following join:\n`df1.join(df2, how='not-a-valid-join-type')`\n\nThe signature of the join is:\n`def join(self, other, on=None, how=None):`\nThe existing code completely ignores the `how` parameter when `on` is `None`. This patch will process the arguments passed to join and pass in to JVM Spark SQL Analyzer, which will validate the join type passed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUsed manual and existing test suites.\n","created_at":"2016-10-10T00:08:33Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T17:20:46Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T17:12:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b67a4f58f8e31e3ce998d44096d4b7a7d675fcf3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bf18321e1ece430af3f58ef974e63beb58781987","head":{"label":"bkpathak:SPARK-14761","ref":"SPARK-14761","sha":"bf18321e1ece430af3f58ef974e63beb58781987","user":{"login":"bkpathak","id":3136407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzY0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3136407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak","html_url":"https://github.com/bkpathak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":57094066,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NzA5NDA2Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"bkpathak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bkpathak","id":3136407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzY0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3136407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak","html_url":"https://github.com/bkpathak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkpathak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bkpathak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we use BufferedInputStream to read the shuffle file which copies the file content from os buffer cache to the user buffer. This adds additional latency in reading the spill files. We made a change to use java nio's direct buffer to read the spill files and for certain pipelines spilling significant amount of data, we see up to 7% speedup for the entire pipeline. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by running the job in the cluster and observed up to 7% speedup.\n","created_at":"2016-10-09T18:06:51Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T18:05:16Z","closed_at":"2016-10-17T18:05:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"93bed83e1c940ac11aeca1f2a10c7af40918f607","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15408/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15408/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15408/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5306fb097ecef7ff69c3281f33f221826879ef04","head":{"label":"sitalkedia:skedia/nio_spill_read","ref":"skedia/nio_spill_read","sha":"5306fb097ecef7ff69c3281f33f221826879ef04","user":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51496876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTQ5Njg3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"sitalkedia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently in standalone mode it is not possible to set the number of executors by using the `--num-executors` or  `spark.executor.instances` property. Instead, as many executors as possible will be spawned based on the available resources and the properties set. \nThis patch corrects that to support the number of executors property. \n\nHere's the new behavior : \n- If the `executor.cores` property isn't set, we will try to spawn one executor on each worker taking all of the cores available (like the default value) while the number of workers < number of executors requested. If we can't launch the specified number of executors, a warning is logged. \n- If the `executor.cores` property is set (repeat the same logic for `executor.memory`):\n  - and `executor.instances` \\* `executor.cores` <= `cores.max`, then `executor.instances` will be spawned,\n  - and `executor.instances` \\* `executor.cores` > `cores.max`, then as many executors will be spawned as it is possible - basically the previous behavior when only executor.cores was set - but we also log a warning saying we couldn't spawn the requested number of executors,\n\nIn the case where `executor.memory` is set, all constraints are taken into account based on the number of cores and memory per worker assigned (same logic as with the cores). \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI tested this patch by running a simple Spark app in standalone mode and specifying the `--num-executors` or `spark.executor.instances property`, and checking if the number of executors was coherent based on the available resources and the requested number of executors. \nI plan on testing this patch by adding tests in `MasterSuite` and running the usual `/dev/run-tests`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe `quotedString` method in `TableIdentifier` and `FunctionIdentifier` produce an illegal (un-parseable) name when the name contains a backtick. For example:\n\n```\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.CatalystSqlParser._\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.TableIdentifier\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedAttribute\nval complexName = TableIdentifier(\"`weird`table`name\", Some(\"`d`b`1\"))\nparseTableIdentifier(complexName.unquotedString) // Does not work\nparseTableIdentifier(complexName.quotedString) // Does not work\nparseExpression(complexName.unquotedString) // Does not work\nparseExpression(complexName.quotedString) // Does not work\n```\n\nWe should handle the backtick properly to make `quotedString` parseable.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd new testcases in `TableIdentifierParserSuite` and `ExpressionParserSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-10-08T11:01:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T06:17:25Z","closed_at":"2016-10-10T04:54:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b823d64759f936eeb8ef3c2be99d421967a7a60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/59a1f0e42bde93975b3a13447e626dcfbebc0d80","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:backtick","ref":"backtick","sha":"59a1f0e42bde93975b3a13447e626dcfbebc0d80","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n[SPARK-14077](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14077) copied the `NaiveBayes` implementation from mllib to ml and left mllib as a wrapper. However, there are some difference between mllib and ml to handle labels:\n- mllib allow input labels as {-1, +1}, however, ml assumes the input labels in range [0, numClasses).\n- mllib `NaiveBayesModel` expose `labels` but ml did not due to the assumption mention above.\n\nDuring the copy in [SPARK-14077](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14077), we use\n`val labels = data.map(_.label).distinct().collect().sorted`\nto get the distinct labels firstly, and then encode the labels for training. It involves extra Spark job compared with the original implementation. Since `NaiveBayes` only do one pass aggregation during training, adding another one seems less efficient. We can get the labels in a single pass along with `NaiveBayes` training and send them to MLlib side.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-10-08T06:54:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T02:59:19Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T02:58:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c9aa2617eca8db5fda9249ffcc95a69e29aeb3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e097adb312012e791e6f75e9c2643b31017eaa86","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-17835","ref":"spark-17835","sha":"e097adb312012e791e6f75e9c2643b31017eaa86","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug in the way LIKE patterns are translated to Java regexes. The bug causes any character following an escaped backslash to be escaped, i.e. there is double-escaping.\r\nA concrete example is the following pattern:`'%\\\\%'`. The expected Java regex that this pattern should correspond to (according to the behavior described below) is `'.*\\\\.*'`, however the current situation leads to `'.*\\\\%'` instead.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate: in light of the discussion that ensued, we should explicitly define the expected behaviour of LIKE expressions, especially in certain edge cases. With the help of @gatorsmile, we put together a list of different RDBMS and their variations wrt to certain standard features.\r\n\r\n| RDBMS\\Features | Wildcards | Default escape [1] | Case sensitivity |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| [MS SQL Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms179859.aspx) | _, %, [], [^] | none | no |\r\n| [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B12037_01/server.101/b10759/conditions016.htm) | _, % | none | yes |\r\n| [DB2 z/OS](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPEK_11.0.0/sqlref/src/tpc/db2z_likepredicate.html) | _, % | none | yes |\r\n| [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-comparison-functions.html) | _, % | none | no |\r\n| [PostreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/functions-matching.html) | _, % | \\ | yes |\r\n| [Hive](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF) | _, % | none | yes |\r\n| Current Spark | _, % | \\ | yes |\r\n\r\n[1] Default escape character: most systems do not have a default escape character, instead the user can specify one by calling a like expression with an escape argument [A] LIKE [B] ESCAPE [C]. This syntax is currently not supported by Spark, however I would volunteer to implement this feature in a separate ticket.\r\n\r\nThe specifications are often quite terse and certain scenarios are undocumented, so here is a list of scenarios that I am uncertain about and would appreciate any input. Specifically I am looking for feedback on whether or not Spark's current behavior should be changed.\r\n1. [x] Ending a pattern with the escape sequence, e.g. `like 'a\\'`.\r\n   PostreSQL gives an error: 'LIKE pattern must not end with escape character', which I personally find logical. Currently, Spark allows \"non-terminated\" escapes and simply ignores them as part of the pattern.\r\n   According to [DB2's documentation](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_9.7.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.messages.sql.doc/doc/msql00130n.html), ending a pattern in an escape character is invalid.\r\n   _Proposed new behaviour in Spark: throw AnalysisException_\r\n2. [x] Empty input, e.g. `'' like ''`\r\n   Postgres and DB2 will match empty input only if the pattern is empty as well, any other combination of empty input will not match. Spark currently follows this rule.\r\n3. [x] Escape before a non-special character, e.g. `'a' like '\\a'`.\r\n   Escaping a non-wildcard character is not really documented but PostgreSQL just treats it verbatim, which I also find the least surprising behavior. Spark does the same.\r\n   According to [DB2's documentation](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_9.7.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.messages.sql.doc/doc/msql00130n.html), it is invalid to follow an escape character with anything other than an escape character, an underscore or a percent sign.\r\n   _Proposed new behaviour in Spark: throw AnalysisException_\r\n\r\nThe current specification is also described in the operator's source code in this patch.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExtra case in regex unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2016-10-08T00:34:06Z","updated_at":"2017-04-17T20:25:57Z","closed_at":"2017-04-17T18:20:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9292e358e94a6398cc75aa25d399fdd9ee9aacb6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15398/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15398/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15398/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dbd305c195ba1c1661f82e3e19085778b8783794","head":{"label":"jodersky:SPARK-17647","ref":"SPARK-17647","sha":"dbd305c195ba1c1661f82e3e19085778b8783794","user":{"login":"jodersky","id":1007012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDcwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky","html_url":"https://github.com/jodersky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"be5fc6ef72c7eb586b184b0f42ac50ef32843208","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nEdgeRDD/VertexRDD overrides checkpoint() and isCheckpointed() to forward these to the internal partitionRDD. So when checkpoint() is called on them, its the partitionRDD that actually gets checkpointed. However since isCheckpointed() also overridden to call partitionRDD.isCheckpointed, EdgeRDD/VertexRDD.isCheckpointed returns true even though this RDD is actually not checkpointed.\n\nThis would have been fine except the RDD's internal logic for computing the RDD depends on isCheckpointed(). So for VertexRDD/EdgeRDD, since isCheckpointed is true, when computing Spark tries to read checkpoint data of VertexRDD/EdgeRDD even though they are not actually checkpointed. Through a crazy sequence of call forwarding, it reads checkpoint data of partitionsRDD and tries to cast it to types in Vertex/EdgeRDD. This leads to ClassCastException.\n\nThe minimal fix that does not change any public behavior is to modify RDD internal to not use public override-able API for internal logic. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew unit

Add mechanism for WLS to handle singular covariance matrices by falling back to QN solver when Cholesky fails.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests - see below.\n## Design choices\n\n**Pluggable Normal Solver**\n\nBefore, the `WeightedLeastSquares` package always used the Cholesky decomposition solver to compute the solution to the normal equations. Now, we specify the solver as a constructor argument to the `WeightedLeastSquares`. We introduce a new trait:\n\n``` scala\nprivate[ml] sealed trait NormalEquationSolver {\n\n  def solve(\n      bBar: Double,\n      bbBar: Double,\n      abBar: DenseVector,\n      aaBar: DenseVector,\n      aBar: DenseVector): NormalEquationSolution\n}\n```\n\nWe extend this trait for different variants of normal equation solvers. In the future, we can easily add others (like QR) using this interface.\n\n**Always train in the standardized space**\n\nThe normal solver did not previously standardize the data, but this patch introduces a change such that we always solve the normal equations in the standardized space. We convert back to the original space in the same way that is done for distributed L-BFGS/OWL-QN. We add test cases for zero variance features/labels.\n\n**Use L-BFGS locally to solve normal equations for singular matrix**\n\nWhen linear regression with the normal solver is called for a singular matrix, we initially try to solve with Cholesky. We use the output of `lapack.dppsv` to determine if the matrix is singular. If it is, we fall back to using L-BFGS locally to solve the normal equations. We add test cases for this as well.\n## Test cases\n\nI found it helpful to enumerate some of the test cases and hopefully it makes review easier.\n\n**WeightedLeastSquares**\n1. Constant columns - Cholesky solver fails with no regularization, Auto solver falls back to QN, and QN trains successfully.\n2. Collinear features - Cholesky solver fails with no regularization, Auto solver falls back to QN, and QN trains successfully.\n3. Label is constant zero - no training is performed regardless of intercept. Coefficients are zero and intercept is zero.\n4. Label is constant - if fitIntercept, then no training is performed and intercept equals label mean. If not fitIntercept, then we train and return an answer that matches R's lm package.\n5. Test with L1 - go through various combinations of L1/L2, standardization, fitIntercept and verify that output matches glmnet.\n6. Initial intercept - verify that setting the initial intercept to label mean is correct by training model with strong L1 regularization so that all coefficients are zero and intercept converges to label mean.\n7. Test diagInvAtWA - since we are standardizing features now during training, we should test that the inverse is computed to match R.\n\n**LinearRegression**\n1. For all existing L1 test cases, test the \"normal\" solver too.\n2. Check that using the normal solver now handles singular matrices.\n3. Check that using the normal solver with L1 produces an objective history in the model summary, but does not produce the inverse of AtA.\n\n**BLAS**\n1. Test new method `dspmv`.\n## Performance Testing\n\nThis patch will speed up linear regression with L1/elasticnet penalties when the feature size is < 4096. I have not conducted performance tests at scale, only observed by testing locally that there is a speed improvement. \n\nWe should decide if this PR needs to be blocked before performance testing is conducted.\n","created_at":"2016-10-07T20:39:34Z","updated_at":"2017-12-01T20:03:30Z","closed_at":"2016-10-25T06:50:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47e389777c0076fef60732421dcf91d90a7906df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15394/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15394/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15394/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/28f8c2f51638f69a1c1bc43f3ccc80c6dca296ac","head":{"label":"sethah:SPARK-17748","ref":"SPARK-17748","sha":"28f8c2f51638f69a1c1bc43f3ccc80c6dca296ac","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn HashJoin, we try to rewrite the join key as Long to improve the performance of finding a match. The rewriting part is not well tested, has a bug that could cause wrong result when there are at least three integral columns in the joining key also the total length of the key exceed 8 bytes. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit test to covering the rewriting with different number of columns and different data types.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nQuoted from JIRA description:\n\nCalling repartition on a PySpark RDD to increase the number of partitions results in highly skewed partition sizes, with most having 0 rows. The repartition method should evenly spread out the rows across the partitions, and this behavior is correctly seen on the Scala side.\n\nPlease reference the following code for a reproducible example of this issue:\n\n```\nnum_partitions = 20000\na = sc.parallelize(range(int(1e6)), 2)  # start with 2 even partitions\nl = a.repartition(num_partitions).glom().map(len).collect()  # get length of each partition\nmin(l), max(l), sum(l)/len(l), len(l)  # skewed!\n```\n\nIn Scala's `repartition` code, we will distribute elements evenly across output partitions. However, the RDD from Python is serialized as a single binary data, so the distribution fails. We need to convert the RDD in Python to java object before repartitioning.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests.\n","created_at":"2016-10-07T05:10:58Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:20:04Z","closed_at":"2016-10-11T18:45:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8841ed570f1ade2b475c068de7865dc0d8750cb0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ce572efa40fcb193ba355ce5dc1d0eb7a1ce796","head":{"label":"viirya:pyspark-rdd-repartition","ref":"pyspark-rdd-repartition","sha":"9ce572efa40fcb193ba355ce5dc1d0eb7a1ce796","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nKafka consumers can't subscribe or maintain heartbeat without polling, but polling ordinarily consumes messages and adjusts position.  We don't want this on the driver, so we poll with a timeout of 0 and pause all topicpartitions.\n\nSome consumer strategies that seek to particular positions have to poll first, but they weren't pausing immediately thereafter.  Thus, there was a race condition where the second poll() in the DStream start method might actually adjust consumer position.\n\nEliminated (or at least drastically reduced the chance of) the race condition via pausing in the relevant consumer strategies, and assert on startup that no messages were consumed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI reliably reproduced the intermittent test failure by inserting a thread.sleep directly before returning from SubscribePattern.  The suggested fix eliminated the failure.\n","created_at":"2016-10-07T01:16:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T22:32:02Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T22:32:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a2f4ed010c764c4762554199d1ce53d875d6f3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aca55de0624f5634acb04f91636dce79af875fab","head":{"label":"koeninger:SPARK-17782","ref":"SPARK-17782","sha":"aca55de0624f5634acb04f91636dce79af875fab","user":{"login":"koeninger","id":98311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger","html_url":"https://github.com/koeninger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26181117,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjE4MTExNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"koeninger/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"koeninger","id":98311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger","html_url":"https://github.com/koeninger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koeninger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/koeninger/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIf given a list of paths, `pyspark.sql.readwriter.text` will attempt to use an undefined variable `paths`.  This change checks if the param `paths` is a basestring and then converts it to a list, so that the same variable `paths` can be used for both cases\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n[SPARK-16757](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16757) sets the hadoop `CallerContext` when calling hadoop/hdfs apis to make spark applications more diagnosable in hadoop/hdfs logs. However, the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.CallerContext` class is only added since [hadoop 2.8](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-9184), which is not officially releaed yet. So each time `utils.CallerContext.setCurrentContext()` is called (e.g [when a task is created](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b678e46/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/Task.scala#L95-L96)), a \"java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.hadoop.ipc.CallerContext\"\nerror is logged, which pollutes the spark logs when there are lots of tasks.\n\nThis patch improves this behaviour by only logging the `ClassNotFoundException` once.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, Spark 2.0 raises an `input path does not exist` AnalysisException if the file name contains '*'. It is misleading since it occurs when there exist some matched files. Also, it was a supported feature in Spark 1.6.2. This PR aims to support wildcard characters in filename for `LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH` SQL command like Spark 1.6.2.\n\n**Reported Error Scenario**\n\n``` scala\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE t(a string)\")\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\n\nscala> sql(\"LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/tmp/x*' INTO TABLE t\")\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: LOAD DATA input path does not exist: /tmp/x*;\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins test with a new test case.\n","created_at":"2016-10-06T07:42:02Z","updated_at":"2016-11-07T00:50:27Z","closed_at":"2016-10-20T08:55:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a701f14b9cd2e20f8ec368dbd789fa42f7c6035c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15376/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15376/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15376/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/933ad856c7fb3712a39557e09da4bc22b75b905c","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-17796","ref":"SPARK-17796","sha":"933ad856c7fb3712a39557e09da4bc22b75b905c","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"56b0f5f4d1d7826737b81ebc4ec5dad83b6463e3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently the no. of partition files are limited to 10000 files (%05d format). If there are more than 10000 part files, the logic goes for a toss while recreating the RDD as it sorts them by string. More details can be found in the JIRA desc [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17417).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI tested this patch by checkpointing a RDD and then manually renaming part files to the old format and tried to access the RDD. It was successfully created from the old format. Also verified loading a sample parquet file and saving it as multiple formats - CSV, JSON, Text, Parquet, ORC and read them successfully back from the saved files. I couldn't launch the unit test from my local box, so will wait for the Jenkins output.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBefore, we computed `instances` in LinearRegression in two spots, even though they did the same thing. One of them did not cast the label column to `DoubleType`. This patch consolidates the computation and always casts the label column to `DoubleType`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a unit test to check all solvers. This test failed before this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nStar schema consists of one or more fact tables referencing a number of dimension tables. In general, queries against star schema are expected to run fast because of the established RI constraints among the tables. This design proposes a join reordering based on natural, generally accepted heuristics for star schema queries:\r\n- Finds the star join with the largest fact table and places it on the driving arm of the left-deep join. This plan avoids large tables on the inner, and thus favors hash joins. \r\n- Applies the most selective dimensions early in the plan to reduce the amount of data flow.\r\n\r\nThe design document was included in SPARK-17791.\r\n\r\nLink to the google doc: [StarSchemaDetection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UAfwbm_A6wo7goHlVZfYK99pqDMEZUumi7pubJXETEA/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new test suite StarJoinSuite.scala was implemented.\r\n","created_at":"2016-10-05T22:41:28Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T21:17:08Z","closed_at":"2017-03-20T08:07:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6d894cf90e612171d7d0e841614dbbb222c2257","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15363/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15363/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15363/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/891813ff7316ab06acfcf28a7268da65ac9fd4cf","head":{"label":"ioana-delaney:starJoinReord2","ref":"starJoinReord2","sha":"891813ff7316ab06acfcf28a7268da65ac9fd4cf","user":{"login":"ioana-delaney","id":17709782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzA5Nzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17709782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-delaney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53364696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzM2NDY5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"ioana-delaney/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ioana-delaney","id":17709782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzA5Nzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17709782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-delaney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-delaney/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds the support for `UserDefinedType` when writing out instead of throwing `ClassCastException` in ORC data source.\n\nIn more details, `OrcStruct` is being created based on string from`DataType.catalogString`. For user-defined type, it seems it returns `sqlType.simpleString` for `catalogString` by default[1]. However, during type-dispatching to match the output with the schema, it tries to cast to, for example, `StructType`[2]. \n\nSo, running the codes below (`MyDenseVector` was borrowed[3]) :\n\n``` scala\nval data = Seq((1, new UDT.MyDenseVector(Array(0.25, 2.25, 4.25))))\nval udtDF = data.toDF(\"id\", \"vectors\")\nudtDF.write.orc(\"/tmp/test.orc\")\n```\n\nends up throwing an exception as below:\n\n```\njava.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.UDT$MyDenseVectorUDT cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.types.ArrayType\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveInspectors$class.wrapperFor(HiveInspectors.scala:381)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.hive.orc.OrcSerializer.wrapperFor(OrcFileFormat.scala:164)\n...\n```\n\nSo, this PR uses `UserDefinedType.sqlType` during finding the correct converter when writing out in ORC data

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe should never expose the Credentials in the EXPLAIN and DESC FORMATTED/EXTENDED command. However, below commands exposed the credentials.\r\n\r\nIn the related PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10452\r\n\r\n> URL patterns to specify credential seems to be vary between different databases. \r\n\r\nThus, we hide the whole `url` value if it contains the keyword `password`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR proposes to add `to_json` function in contrast with `from_json` in Scala, Java and Python.\n\nIt'd be useful if we can convert a same column from/to json. Also, some datasources do not support nested types. If we are forced to save a dataframe into those data sources, we might be able to work around by this function.\n\nThe usage is as below:\n\n``` scala\nval df = Seq(Tuple1(Tuple1(1))).toDF(\"a\")\ndf.select(to_json($\"a\").as(\"json\")).show()\n```\n\n``` bash\n+--------+\n|    json|\n+--------+\n|{\"_1\":1}|\n+--------+\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in `JsonFunctionsSuite` and `JsonExpressionsSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-10-05T02:51:08Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:43:56Z","closed_at":"2016-11-01T19:48:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5fa4698735fa647cbccfd1d403ffb756e872f987","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15354/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15354/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15354/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/971d1c0c134bd721f985480aa3274d8bd9b9a72c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-17764","ref":"SPARK-17764","sha":"971d1c0c134bd721f985480aa3274d8bd9b9a72c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe result of the `Last` function can be wrong when the last partition processed is empty. It can return `null` instead of the expected value. For example, this can happen when we process partitions in the following order:\n\n```\n- Partition 1 [Row1, Row2]\n- Partition 2 [Row3]\n- Partition 3 []\n```\n\nIn this case the `Last` function will currently return a null, instead of the value of `Row3`.\n\nThis PR fixes this by adding a `valueSet` flag to the `Last` function.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nWe only used end to end tests for `DeclarativeAggregateFunction`s. I have added an evaluator for these functions so we can tests them in catalyst. I have added a `LastTestSuite` to test the `Last` aggregate function.\n","created_at":"2016-10-04T18:21:42Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T23:07:43Z","closed_at":"2016-10-05T23:07:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"480df634904678b96e86ddba8ec067942200339d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15348/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15348/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15348/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b442debd33f6e985aa4ca536e2e8607db3ba477","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-17758","ref":"SPARK-17758","sha":"8b442debd33f6e985aa4ca536e2e8607db3ba477","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix a bug where spill metrics were being reported as shuffle metrics. Eventually these spill metrics should be reported (SPARK-3577), but separate from shuffle metrics. The fix itself basically reverts the line to what it was in 1.6.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested on a job that was reporting shuffle writes even for the final stage, when no shuffle writes should take place. After the change the job no longer shows these writes. \n\nBefore:\n![screen shot 2016-10-03 at 6 39 59

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we use the same rule to parse top level and nested data fields. For example:\n\n```\ncreate table tbl_x(\n  id bigint,\n  nested struct<col1:string,col2:string>\n)\n```\n\nShows both syntaxes. In this PR we split this rule in a top-level and nested rule.\n\nBefore this PR,\n\n```\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE my_tab(column1: INT)\")\n```\n\nworks fine.\nAfter this PR, it will throw a `ParseException`:\n\n```\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE my_tab(column1: INT)\")\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\nno viable alternative at input 'CREATE TABLE my_tab(column1:'(line 1, pos 27)\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd new testcases in `SparkSqlParserSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-10-04T17:21:28Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T11:52:33Z","closed_at":"2016-10-10T05:02:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f894f77f85cfadbedacbf70d19d1f4348d28e74a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15346/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15346/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15346/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/605aeb60bedfbc042c237360345951ec5593e7a3","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:cdt","ref":"cdt","sha":"605aeb60bedfbc042c237360345951ec5593e7a3","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a revival of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14948 and related to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14937. This removes the 'runs' parameter, which has already been disabled, from the K-means implementation and further deprecates API methods that involve it.\n\nThis also happens to resolve the issue that K-means should not return duplicate centers, meaning that it may return less than k centroids if not enough data is available.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests\n","created_at":"2016-10-04T10:26:47Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T09:02:28Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T09:02:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb3eca0f5879f33001af2e283991f05261af3cfd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15342/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15342/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15342/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ba52582a1313be9d9febe215fe6f21b2d9be239f","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-11560","ref":"SPARK-11560","sha":"ba52582a1313be9d9febe215fe6f21b2d9be239f","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix:\n- GroupedMeanEvaluator and GroupedSumEvaluator are unused, as is the StudentTCacher support class\n- CountEvaluator can return a lower bound < 0, when counts can't be negative\n- MeanEvaluator will actually fail on exactly 1 datum (yields t-test with 0 DOF)\n- CountEvaluator uses a normal distribution, which may be an inappropriate approximation (leading to above)\n- Test for SumEvaluator asserts incorrect expected sums – e.g. after observing 10% of data has sum of 2, expectation should be 20, not 38\n- CountEvaluator, MeanEvaluator have no unit tests to catch these\n- Duplication of distribution code across CountEvaluator, GroupedCountEvaluator\n- The stats in each could use a bit of documentation as I had to guess at them\n- (Code could use a few cleanups and optimizations too)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting and new tests\n","created_at":"2016-10-04T09:26:35Z","updated_at":"2016-10-08T10:32:20Z","closed_at":"2016-10-08T10:32:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eedddfe6d28ea085e73dc56cec5074328fc750ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15341/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15341/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15341/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/22d4093acc778fa355eb80c2ff4a649448597eda","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-17768","ref":"SPARK-17768","sha":"22d4093acc778fa355eb80c2ff4a649448597eda","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd a SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE environment variable flag to spark-daemon.sh that causes the process it would run to be run in the foreground.\n\nIt looks like there has been some prior work in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/3881, but there was some talk about these being refactored. I'm not sure if that happened or not, but that PR is almost 2 years old at this point so it was worth revisiting.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n./dev/run-tests still seems to work. It doesn't look like these scripts have tests, but if I missed them just let me know.\n","created_at":"2016-10-04T00:15:57Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T08:52:16Z","closed_at":"2016-10-20T08:52:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42b5071ad00ef3efe2ac101a57931b48ff6e545d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15338/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15338/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15338/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7010b28c7e7ba73a26cdee4bb6e0698152b27c0d","head":{"label":"MustWin:SPARK-11653","ref":"SPARK-11653","sha":"7010b28c7e7ba73a26cdee4bb6e0698152b27c0d","user":{"login":"MustWin","id":3650631,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2NTA2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3650631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin","html_url":"https://github.com/MustWin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69910577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTkxMDU3Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"MustWin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MustWin","id":3650631,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM2NTA2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3650631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin","html_url":"https://github.com/MustWin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MustWin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MustWin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, Spark supports ExternalCatalog, but the usage is limited to `HiveExternalCatalog` by using `private string` variables for class name holder. This PR aims to parameterize those variables as SQL configuration and supports `user-provided` ExternalCatalog and SessionState classes.\n\nThe following is an intended use case and a snippet of test case in this PR.\n\n``` scala\nval session = SparkSession.builder()\n  .master(\"local\")\n  .config(\"spark.sql.externalCatalog\", \"org.apache.spark.sql.MyExternalCatalog\")\n  .config(\"spark.sql.externalSessionState\", \"org.apache.spark.sql.MySessionState\")\n  .enableProvidedCatalog()\n  .getOrCreate()\n\nassert(session.sharedState.externalCatalog.isInstanceOf[MyExternalCatalog])\nassert(session.sessionState.isInstanceOf[MySessionState])\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins test with a new test case.\n","created_at":"2016-10-03T21:18:29Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T07:03:02Z","closed_at":"2016-10-03T23:52:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6db44f5b148b1f1916f301ce08406ddd8e17bb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15336/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15336/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15336/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d0a17787cf31a1ed4d9dde0ead2255e7d02cb7e2","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-17767","ref":"SPARK-17767","sha":"d0a17787cf31a1ed4d9dde0ead2255e7d02cb7e2","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1f31bdaef670dd43999613deae3620f4ddcd1fbf","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn practice we cannot guarantee that an `InternalRow` is immutable. This makes the `MutableRow` almost redundant. This PR folds `MutableRow` into `InternalRow`.\n\nThe code below illustrates the immutability issue with InternalRow:\n\n``` scala\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GenericMutableRow\nval struct = new GenericMutableRow(1)\nval row = InternalRow(struct, 1)\nprintln(row)\nscala> [[null], 1]\nstruct.setInt(0, 42)\nprintln(row)\nscala> [[42], 1]\n```\n\nThis might be somewhat controversial, so feedback is appreciated.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-10-03T18:31:56Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T21:06:05Z","closed_at":"2016-10-07T21:06:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b68d4be93c6fb3049b6465f3add67de0c3750d7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15333/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15333/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15333/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b650c86be80855e1d0b4783f2a179e414a067dcc","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-17761","ref":"SPARK-17761","sha":"b650c86be80855e1d0b4783f2a179e414a067dcc","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n**Description** from JIRA\n\nThe TimestampType in Spark SQL is of microsecond precision. Ideally, we should convert Spark SQL timestamp values into Parquet TIMESTAMP_MICROS. But unfortunately parquet-mr hasn't supported it yet.\nFor the read path, we should be able to read TIMESTAMP_MILLIS Parquet values and pad a 0 microsecond part to read values.\nFor the write path, currently we are writing timestamps as INT96, similar to Impala and Hive. One alternative is that, we can have a separate SQL option to let users be able to write Spark SQL timestamp values as TIMESTAMP_MILLIS. Of course, in this way the microsecond part will be truncated.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new tests in ParquetQuerySuite and ParquetIOSuite\n","created_at":"2016-10-03T18:22:45Z","updated_at":"2017-11-09T10:47:08Z","closed_at":"2017-04-04T00:55:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d5422f734a578de323caa7477e95fb290b38654","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e2d0182ffaadd90925cea51aeec58001d3e412db","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:parquet-time-millis","ref":"parquet-time-millis","sha":"e2d0182ffaadd90925cea51aeec58001d3e412db","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis Pull request comprises of the critical bug SPARK-16575 changes. This change rectifies the issue with BinaryFileRDD partition calculations as  upon creating an RDD with sc.binaryFiles, the resulting RDD always just consisted of two partitions only.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe original issue ie. getNumPartitions on binary Files RDD (always having two partitions) was first replicated and then tested upon the changes. Also the unit tests have been checked and passed.\n\nThis contribution is my original work and I licence the work to the project under the project's open source license\n\n@srowen @hvanhovell @rxin
