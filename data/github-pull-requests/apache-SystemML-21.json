allows the Java API to return a `Matrix` type, with the Python side creating a simple wrapper around it.  Then, the user can either use this `Matrix` object in a future SystemML script, or can convert it to a DataFrame with `toDF()`.  For the latter conversion, I've opted to go ahead and sort by the row index, and then drop the index column by default, although the option exists for the user to instead keep the row index (\"ID\")

implemented maxpool, maxpool backward, tsmm GPU instruction and updated memory management policy for GPU.\n1. For maxpool, I leveraged cudnnPoolingForward()\n2. For maxpool backward, I used cudnnPoolingBackward(). Here, I’ve called cudnnPoolingForward() first because cudnnPoolingBackward() needs output of cudnnPoolingForward() as one of the inputs. To resolve this, we would need to make changes at Language level.\n3. For tsmm, I have called cublasDsyrk() twice because Dsyrk stores the resultant matrix in either Upper Triangular or Lower triangular format. First call fills the upper triangular by passing the parameter ‘U’ (for upper triangular) and then to fill the lower triangular in the second call we provide ‘L’ (for lower triangular) parameter. I’ll update it if I come across such api which does the flipping or if we plan to write our own kernel to do flipping. I compared its performance with (a) Dgemm and (b) calling Dsyrk once and sending the output to CP for flipping. Its performance with Dgemm is same as we are calling Dsyrk twice. With respect to (b), my implementation is 4x to 7x faster.\n4. Updated eviction policy: Instead of evicting the largest object from GPU, I’m evicting the object which is closest to the required eviction size. I will further update it by creating a hybrid policy and taking into account LRU/LFU + look ahead into the execution plan for the life cycle of the GPU object.\n5.

Fixed bugs in scala LogisticRegression wrapper (handling of raw predictions and passing dfam).\n2. Extended java MLContext to accept MatrixBlock. Also added utility function in Python file. (Also created https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYSTEMML-846. It should be a good migration task to learn Python MLContext).\n3. Added mllearn class to allow scikit-learn and MLPipeline users to use SystemML. \n### Using SystemML's Logistic Regression (scikit-learn way):\n\n``` python\nfrom sklearn import datasets, neighbors\nimport SystemML as sml\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext\nsqlCtx = SQLContext(sc)\ndigits = datasets.load_digits()\nX_digits = digits.data\ny_digits = digits.target + 1\nn_samples = len(X_digits)\nX_train = X_digits[:.9 * n_samples]\ny_train = y_digits[:.9 * n_samples]\nX_test = X_digits[.9 * n_samples:]\ny_test = y_digits[.9 * n_samples:]\nimport time\nt1 = time.time()\nlogistic = sml.mllearn.LogisticRegression(sqlCtx)\nprint('LogisticRegression score: %f' % logistic.fit(X_train, y_train).score(X_test, y_test))\nt2 = time.time()\n# Convert to DataFrame for i/o: current way to transfer data\nlogistic = sml.mllearn.LogisticRegression(sqlCtx, transferUsingDF=True)\nprint('LogisticRegression score: %f' % logistic.fit(X_train, y_train).score(X_test, y_test))\nt3 = time.time()\nprint('Execution time: without DF: %f and with DF: %f' % (t2-t1, t3-t2))\n```\n\nPoints to note:\n- The execution time without DF is 1-2 seconds whereas with DF is 18-20 seconds.\n- The current version only supports numeric labels/features.\n- The above interface is especially useful if the input/output fit on the node, but the intermediate data doesn't.\n### Using SystemML's Logistic Regression (MLPipeline way):\n\n``` python\nfrom pyspark.ml import Pipeline\nimport SystemML as sml\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import HashingTF, Tokenizer\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext\nsqlCtx = SQLContext(sc)\ntraining = sqlCtx.createDataFrame([\n    (0L, \"a b c d e spark\", 1.0),\n    (1L, \"b d\", 2.0),\n    (2L, \"spark f g h\", 1.0),\n    (3L, \"hadoop mapreduce\",

HashingTF(inputCol=\"words\", outputCol=\"features\", numFeatures=20)\nlr = sml.mllearn.LogisticRegression(sqlCtx)\npipeline = Pipeline(stages=[tokenizer, hashingTF, lr])\nmodel =

\"text\"])\nprediction = model.transform(test)\nprediction.show()\n```\n### Using SystemML's Linear Regression (scikit-learn way):\n\n``` python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nimport SystemML as sml\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext\n# Load the diabetes dataset\ndiabetes = datasets.load_diabetes()\n# Use only one feature\ndiabetes_X = diabetes.data[:, np.newaxis, 2]\n# Split the data into training/testing sets\ndiabetes_X_train = diabetes_X[:-20]\ndiabetes_X_test = diabetes_X[-20:]\n# Split the targets into training/testing sets\ndiabetes_y_train = diabetes.target[:-20]\ndiabetes_y_test = diabetes.target[-20:]\n# Create linear regression object\nregr = sml.mllearn.LinearRegression(sqlCtx)\n# Train the model using the training sets\nregr.fit(diabetes_X_train, diabetes_y_train)\n# The mean square error\nprint(\"Residual sum of squares: %.2f\" % np.mean((regr.predict(diabetes_X_test) - diabetes_y_test) ** 2))\n```\n### Using SystemML's SVM (scikit-learn way):\n\n``` python\nfrom sklearn import datasets, neighbors\nimport SystemML as sml\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext\nsqlCtx = SQLContext(sc)\ndigits = datasets.load_digits()\nX_digits = digits.data\ny_digits = digits.target \nn_samples = len(X_digits)\nX_train = X_digits[:.9 * n_samples]\ny_train = y_digits[:.9 * n_samples]\nX_test = X_digits[.9 * n_samples:]\ny_test = y_digits[.9 * n_samples:]\nsvm = sml.mllearn.SVM(sqlCtx, is_multi_class=True)\nprint('LogisticRegression score: %f' % svm.fit(X_train, y_train).score(X_test, y_test))\n```\n### Using SystemML's SVM (MLPipeline way):\n\n``` python\nfrom pyspark.ml import Pipeline\nimport SystemML as sml\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import HashingTF, Tokenizer\nfrom pyspark.sql import SQLContext\nsqlCtx = SQLContext(sc)\ntraining = sqlCtx.createDataFrame([\n    (0L, \"a b c d e spark\", 1.0),\n    (1L, \"b d\", 2.0),\n    (2L, \"spark f g h\", 1.0),\n    (3L, \"hadoop mapreduce\",

\"text\"])\nprediction = model.transform(test)\nprediction.show()\n```\n### Using SystemML's Naive Bayes (Scikit learn way):\n\n``` python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\nfrom

update cleans up and reorganizes a lot of the existing documentation. The goal here is to work towards cleaning up our external message and targeting specific types of users in order to increase ease of adoption.\n\nMy vision is that we target data scientists using Spark first and foremost.  Without this focus in our documentation, the project is seemingly too confusing, and will deter this key user demographic from adoption.  Once these users are onboard, engine developers will follow.\n\nThis PR is a first effort towards this goal, and provides a nicer, cleaned-up version of the docs.  We should _collectively_ work to improve these, with clear separation between data scientists, systems engineers/researchers, etc.\n\nA preview can be [found here](http://dusenberrymw.github.io/incubator-systemml/).\n\n@frreiss, @mboehm7, @niketanpansare, @nakul02, @gweidner, @asurve, @deroneriksson,

Iterable -> Iterator\n[SPARK-3369 Java mapPartitions Iterator->Iterable is inconsistent with Scala's Iterator->Iterator](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3369)\n\n3) DataFrame -> Dataset[_]\n[SPARK-14500](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14500) Accept Dataset[_] instead of DataFrame in MLlib APIs\n\n4) spark.mllib.linalg -> spark.ml.linalg\n[SPARK-13944 Separate out local linear algebra as a standalone module without Spark dependency](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13944)\n\nAdditional changes were also required due to following JIRAs:\n[SPARK-12600 Remove deprecated methods in SQL / DataFrames](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12600)\n[SPARK-14625 TaskUIData and ExecutorUIData shouldn't be case

org.apache.spark.internal.Logging](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13928)\n\nNote a work-around was also implemented where Spark 2.0.0 introduced a defect when run on Windows:\n[SPARK-15893 spark.createDataFrame raises an exception in Spark 2.0 tests on Windows](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15893)\n[SPARK-15899 file scheme should be used correctly](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15899)\n\nAdditional information on Spark 2.0.0 including removals and behavior changes can be found in [release

make progress on adoption front, I think we need to support embedded Python DSL. So, I have created this PR as an initial proposal. I have added subset of builtin functions (namely, full/rand.*/mlprint/dot), binary/unary operators for matrices and parfor as an example language level construct. \n\nPlease use this PR to facilitate further discussion on this topic. Here are some initial points:\n1. What is preferred usage scenario for a Python data scientist ?\n   a. Scikit-learn like-library. In this case, we can call the DML algorithms using MLContext.\n   b. External DSL approach: The data scientists will write her code in PyDML and then use MLContext.\n   c. Embedded DSL approach.\n2. Even in embedded DSL approach, there are two possible implementation choices:\n   a. Execute code with a context (as in this PR). \n   Pros: Simple and elegant push-down mechanism and no redundant computation.\n   Cons: Difficult to implement mixed code.\n   b. Add lazy data structures which will be executed only when certain actions are invoked on them.\n3. Push-down of language-level constructs (**Will skip this in this commit**):\n   a. No modification to Python implementation, but slightly inelegant usage through use of functions (as in this PR). See parfor invocation in the below code.\n   b. Modify Python parser to support pushdown. This requires users to rebuilt oru version of python from scratch. \n4. Whether to add standalone support as it requires reimplementing Py4J bridge of PySpark.\n5. APIs of the built-in functions: Should it be similar to PyDML ?\n\nIf after the discussion, we decide to go in different direction, I will delete this PR.\n\nIf we agree to go in this direction, I can create following tasks on JIRA:\n1. Make Python embedded DSL feature complete.\n2. Add documentation and examples for Python embedded DSL.\n3. Create .py files for all our algorithms using Python embedded DSL. We can keep interface similar to scikit-learn.\n4. Add additional input/output mechanism (other than DataFrame), for example: binary blocked RDD, string rdd, MLLib's BlockMatrix, NumPy arrays, etc.\n5. Add Py4J support to allow standalone usage and create pip installer for systemml.\n\nPlease note: I am using older MLContext approach and we can update it to newer MLContext once it is delivered. \n\nAn example script supported by this commit:\n\n``` python\n# wget https://sparktc.ibmcloud.com/repo/latest/systemml-0.11.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT.jar\n# pyspark --master local[*] --driver-class-path systemml-0.11.0-incubating-SNAPSHOT.jar\n\n>>> import SystemML as sml\n>>> import numpy as np\n>>> sml.setSparkContext(sc)\n\nWelcome to Apache SystemML!\n\n>>> m1 = sml.matrix(np.ones((3,3)) + 2)\n>>> m2 = sml.matrix(np.ones((3,3)) + 3)\n>>> m2 = m1 * (m2 + m1)\n>>> m4 = 1.0 - m2\n>>> m4\n# This matrix (mVar5) is backed by below given PyDML script (which is not yet evaluated).

is a preliminary support of Sparse matrix multiplication on GPU.\nWith this PR, sparse \\* sparse matrix multiplication support on the GPU is added.\nsparse \\* dense support will be added after discussion here, if at all.\n\nHere are some performance benchmarks I ran on a very beefy node with NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs. \nThe benchmark compares a matrix multiply in CP with the same matrix multiply on GPU.\n`-gpu force=true` option was used on the command line.\n\nOnly one GPU was used.\nThe test machine had 24 cores (E5-2620), 128GB.\nCUDA version - 7.5\nOS - RHEL6\n\nIn the graphs, the blue line is for the GPU. Please note that the graphs are in log-scale on the y-axis.\nThe x-axis represents the values of M,N & K where a block of size (M_K) is multiplied with a block of size (K_N). Sparsity was set to `0.3` for both matrices.\nFor missing data points, 0 was inserted.\nThere were crashes with higher sizes; investigation on these is pending.\n\n![matmult](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5394361/17075054/1c75775e-503d-11e6-94b3-1921e689cc16.png)\n![execution](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5394361/17075055/1c781bf8-503d-11e6-93d2-4aeb940b9a68.png)\n![elapse](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5394361/17075053/1c752a9c-503d-11e6-948b-7a8ab165cfe2.png)\n\nAlso note that the wallclock/elapsed time for the GPU run had a large compilation time (about 5 seconds). This is to be investigated also.\n\n[Here](https://gist.github.com/nakul02/3a7f76c27c8581d3aa51cbeac435ab34) are SVG Versions of the same graphs.

introduces a new deep learning DML library, **SystemML-NN**.  SystemML-NN is a layers-based library written in pure DML that contains layers with a simple forward/backward API for affine, spatial convolution, max-pooling, non-linearities (relu, sigmoid, softmax, etc.), dropout, loss functions, other layers, optimizers, and gradient checks.\n\n**SystemML-NN**:\n- Layers:\n  - Core:\n    - Affine\n    - Spatial Convolution\n    - Max Pooling\n  - Nonlinearities:\n    - ReLU\n    - Sigmoid\n    - Softmax\n    - Tanh\n  - Loss:\n    - Cross-entropy loss\n    - L1 loss\n    - L2 loss\n    - Log (\"Logistic\") loss\n  - Regularization:\n    - Dropout\n    - L1 reg\n    - L2 reg\n- Optimizers:\n  - Adagrad\n  - Adam\n  - RMSprop\n  - SGD\n  - SGD w/ Momentum\n  - SGD w/ Nesterov Momentum\n- Tests:\n  - Gradient Checks\n\nThe upstream, experimental version of the codebase lives at [https://github.com/dusenberrymw/systemml-nn](https://github.com/dusenberrymw/systemml-nn), and this addition represents the portion of the codebase that is relatively stable.  In particular, vanilla RNNs & LSTMs are currently still in experimental status upstream, but will be added soon.  The idea is to rapidly work on the upstream repo, and then contribute stable pieces to the main SystemML repo.  For now, we will keep this in the `scripts/staging`

Added initial version of DML generator that supports SGD with momentum+weight decay for various learning rate schedules (const, exp, step, inv) and various initializers (constant, uniform, gaussian, xavier, msra).\n2. The initial version contains layers required to implement Lenet. Also added an example Lenet.proto that is able get 98% accuracy on MNIST dataset after 1200 iteration over validation set. This can be improved by trying different learning rate schedule.\n\n``` python\nITER=0 Validation set accuracy (%): 10.72\nITER=100 Validation set accuracy (%): 91.18\nITER=200 Validation set accuracy (%): 94.74\nITER=300 Validation set accuracy (%): 96.42\nITER=400 Validation set accuracy (%): 95.84\nITER=500 Validation set accuracy (%): 96.52\nITER=600 Validation set accuracy (%): 96.84\nITER=700 Validation set accuracy (%): 96.86\nITER=800 Validation set accuracy (%): 97.76\nITER=900 Validation set accuracy (%): 97.78\nITER=1000 Validation set accuracy (%): 98.08\n```\n\nTODOs:\n1. Integrate Barista into DMLScript that way user can run proto directly. Example: hadoop jar SystemML.jar -f LenetSolver.proto -caffe\n2. Discuss and reach consensus on the format of input dataset for Data layer. The current version is only a reference implementation to facilitate discussion. In addition, we need to provide preprocessing tools to convert jpeg images into our binary format, perform z-scoring, etc.\n3. Also, the current version generates test DML code in the same DML script. Instead we can create two different DML scripts (for example: GLM.dml and GLM-predict.dml)\n4. Consolidate the forward/backward functions in this prototype with Mike's DML bodied function that way we suggest exactly one way to implement a given layer.\n5. Add additional example proto files. For example: auto-encoder.\n6. Add additional layers. For example: LSTM, RNN, etc.\n7. Add additional solver types. For example: Adagrad, ...\n8. Add tutorial that describes end-to-end example (for example: download dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, apply preprocessing to convert it into binary block format, ...).\n9. Add support for transfer learning.\n\n@bertholdreinwald @dusenberrymw @mboehm7 @prithvirajsen Please have a look and provide suggestions/comments.\n","created_at":"2016-05-13T22:23:54Z","updated_at":"2017-03-08T07:10:22Z","closed_at":"2017-03-08T07:10:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82ae080bce745f45b93afdf1e726ba3bb2a2b18a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/158/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/158/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/158/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/bd0ccb4b335e94d6b1f126b4b42a6f5daca92d05","head":{"label":"niketanpansare:caffe_new","ref":"caffe_new","sha":"bd0ccb4b335e94d6b1f126b4b42a6f5daca92d05","user":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53172132,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzE3MjEzMg==","name":"systemml","full_name":"niketanpansare/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"niketanpansare","id":11686380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg2Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11686380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare","html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niketanpansare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/niketanpansare/systemml","description":"Mirror

slicing correctly uses inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds. However, a really useful piece of slicing syntax we are currently missing from PyDML is the ability to have implicit lower or upper bounds, i.e., `X[:3,]` should return all rows up to (but not including) 3. This means that the implicit lower bound is 0. Similarly, `X[2:,]` should return all rows starting at row 2 (0-based), which implies that the upper bound is equal to the number of rows of `X`.  We should update the grammar to allow these cases, row both row and column slicing.  More generally, `X[:,:]`, should also be valid, regardless if it is useful.\n\nExample (PyDML):\n\n```\nN = 4\nD = 3\nX = matrix(\"[1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9; 10 11 12]\")\nX = X[:2,1:]  # slice with implicit lower row and upper column bounds\n\n# print\nfor i in 0:nrow(X)-1:\n  for j in 0:ncol(X)-1:\n    print(\"X[\"+i+\",\"+j+\"]: \" + scalar(X[i,j]))\n```\n\n```\nX[0,0]: 2.0\nX[0,1]: 3.0\nX[1,0]: 5.0\nX[1,1]:

patch adds support for overriding built-in functions.  The approach was to track new internal and external function definition names per script and skip built-in function call handling if the function name was also defined by user (or imported when converting pydml syntax).  Also added parse error detection/reporting if user attempts to define two functions with same name in same script.  Previously, the second definition would overwrite the

Added following built-in function: conv2d, conv2d_backward_*, maxpooling, maxpooling_backward.\n2. The documentation is available in docs/devdocs folder.\n\nTo test this built-in functions, I tested the results against Stanford's Python scripts for Deep Learning and also compared the results with CuDNN. To make the test suite more generic, we have following options:\n1. Compare the above built-in functions against existing R package. I could not find one that fit our need. Please suggest if you know any R package that allows one to compute the above functions.\n2. Add Python dependency for our dev environment and compare against existing DL packages. For example: TensorFlow/Stanford's Python scripts.\n3. Write the logic of conv2d into R and compare against it. For this approach, I tried to use https://github.com/dusenberrymw/systemml-nn/blob/master/nn/layers/conv.dml but ran into some errors which will get ironed out soon. The benefit of this approach is that we donot add any additional dependency on our test suite, but the drawback is that we are comparing the semantics against our alternate implementation and not against external

patch with new tests changes the way namespaces are tracked internally (i.e., uses qualified script file path) to prevent collisions. Previously, functions would be lost if the same namespace was specified when importing different scripts which resulted in error being reported as function undefined in namespace.  With this change, 'source(file1) as namespace1' in one script does not interfere with 'source(file2) as namespace1' in another script.  Note an error is reported at source statement if same namespace specified for different scripts within the same file
