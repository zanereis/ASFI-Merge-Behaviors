Description\r\nIn ACS, when a VPC has more than one public IP and a user tries to use the non `source NAT` IP with some feature/option (like `static NAT`, `port forwarding`, `VPN` and others), ACS adds the public IP (used for the feature/option) as `source NAT` in the `iptables` of the VR.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n- VPC has one public IP `192.168.0.50` and it is defined as the `source NAT`.\r\n- If we assign another public IP `192.168.0.51` to the VPC and use it to execute `port forwarding`, ACS will automatically add `192.168.0.51` as `source NAT` too.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to remove this inconsistency created by ACS.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup,

locally, in a test lab.\r\n1. Created a VPC;\r\n2. Observed VR's `iptables`;\r\n3. Added public IPs to the VPC, assigned functions, tested and removed them;\r\n4. Before this change, every public IP would turn into a `source NAT` and mess up with the `iptables`. After the changes, the `source NAT` is kept along all the process and only the real function of the public IP is

Description\r\n\r\nThe quota calculation has been wrong for monthly tariffs (like Compute-Month, GB-Month, etc) for so much time but even when #3448 was reported it was closed without evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe wrong calculation was the price per hour, it was taking the monthly tariff and multiplying by the aggregation ratio which has no sense at all.\r\n\r\nThe right price per hour is the monthly tariff divided by the standard number of hours in a month.\r\n\r\nFixes #3448.\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!---

can be solved in one of 2 ways, \r\n1. Do not unmount the secondary store across successive runs of the diagnostic service clean up job or collection of diagnostic data(on vmware)\r\n2. Fix the issue of unmount (by running the umount command using sudo) and clean up the mount path so that during successive runs a new mount path can be created - https://github.com/shapeblue/cloudstack/commit/a9b460869b8f244f4b3db3cc3973f3419dffed83\r\n\r\nCurrent solution follows Option 1 as it seems to be a simpler fix, and the storage unmount happens during Cloudstack Management service restarts\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #4406  (probably)\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the disk offering of ROOT disk is not same as service offering of VM.\r\nfor example\r\n(1) create a vm but not start it, then scale vm to another service offering\r\n(2) reinstall vm, then scale vm to another service offering\r\n\r\nThese two issues are fixed by this PR.\r\nThe issue might exist in some other scenarios, so it would be better to always update ROOT disk offering tags to the tags of vm service offering in DeploymentPlanningManagerImpl.java.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the intermittent failure observed in test_02_list_snapshots_with_removed_data_store of the test_snapshot.py test suite.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new API endpoint to update pod management network IP range.\r\n\r\nCurrently, pod management IP range can only be expanded under the same subnet. Editing the current pod IP management range is a challenge, especially as the list of IP ranges is greater than one. The purpose of this feature is to allow ADMINS to be able to update size of IP range of management pod, upwards or downwards.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends from #4010\r\n\r\n- Updatepodmanagementnetworkiprange will update already existing IP ranges. Will not create a new IP range.\r\n- Will increase/reduce available IPs within the range.\r\n- PodID/Currentstartip/CurrentendIp are mandatory fields. Newstartip and Newendip are optional fields and one of them should be specified. When anyone is left blank, Newstartip will be set to Currentstartip and Newendip will be set to Currentendip.\r\n- API only available to root admin and does not have any sensitive information passed.\r\n- Will output success response -true/false\r\n- Does not alter structure of DB, but will update contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n**When to use**\r\n\r\n- Reducing size of existing IP range\r\n- Increasing size of existing IP range\r\n\r\n**How to use**\r\n\r\nRun `list pods` command to see existing IP ranges\r\n```\r\n> list pods\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 1,\r\n  \"pod\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"allocationstate\": \"Enabled\",\r\n      \"endip\": [\r\n        \"172.16.15.210\",\r\n        \"172.16.15.204\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"forsystemvms\": [\r\n        \"0\",\r\n        \"0\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"gateway\": \"172.16.15.1\",\r\n      \"id\": \"1407da22-a131-4dbd-86a3-45210a26897e\",\r\n      \"name\": \"POD0\",\r\n      \"netmask\": \"255.255.255.0\",\r\n      \"startip\": [\r\n        \"172.16.15.205\",\r\n        \"172.16.15.2\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"vlanid\": [\r\n        \"vlan://untagged\",\r\n        \"vlan://untagged\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"zoneid\": \"3ab731d6-efd5-418c-ab2b-cacbfc4b88f0\",\r\n      \"zonename\": \"Sandbox-simulator\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Update the IP range you'd like to change. In our case, we want to increase the range `172.16.15.205-172.16.15.210` to `172.16.15.205-172.16.15.215`. Use the command `update podmanagementnetworkiprange`\r\n\r\n```\r\n> update podmanagementnetworkiprange podid=1407da22-a131-4dbd-86a3-45210a26897e currentstartip=172.16.15.205

Description\r\n\r\n1. In UI, with Backup Plugin enabled, a new tab inside Service Offerings, called Backup Offerings, appears. In this tab, users can import a Backup Offering. However, regardless of what the user chooses, the `Allow User Driven Backups` parameter is always send as true\r\n\r\n2. In UI, with Quota Plugin enabled, a new tab, called Quota, appears. In this tab there is a component called Tariff, which is responsible for displaying the tariffs of each resource. In addition, in this view there is an edit button that, when clicked, does nothing.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n1.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31869303/133452664-241492ab-81ca-418a-9426-1e58ee59870a.png)\r\n\r\n2. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31869303/133452145-b4bda529-f4be-4429-b828-0e507baca586.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n1. I imported a Backup Offering with `Allow User Driven Backups` parameter as `false` and checked, using cloud-monkey and in the DB if this parameter as correctly set.\r\n2.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes issue #5407. In summary, volumes that should not be migrated are still being mapped in `VirtualMachineManagerImpl.createStoragePoolMappingsForVolumes`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give some context: method `createStoragePoolMappingsForVolumes` is used only when migrating a VM with its volume(s), therefore via the API call [migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume](https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.15/apis/migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume.html).\r\n\r\nIn such cases, there are two options: \r\nA. User does not provide volumes, just the VM ID, and Host ID\r\nB. User provides VM ID, Host ID, and a volume map, e.g. `migrateto[0].volume=71f43cd6-69b0-4d3b-9fbc-67f50963d60b&migrateto[0].pool=a382f181-3d2b-4413-b92d-b8931befa7e1&migrateto[1].volume=88de0173-55c0-4c1c-a269-83d0279eeedf&migrateto[1].pool=95d6e97c-6766-4d67-9a30-c449c15011d1`.\r\n\r\nHowever, regardless of case A or B, `createStoragePoolMappingsForVolumes` iterates all the VM's volumes and adds to be migrated. Therefore, this causes exceptions when migrating VMs with data disk attached whenever the data-disk (shared) should not be migrated.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, it does not make sense to add volumes that the user has not mapped to be migrated unless the VM is migrated to **(I)** different cluster or **(II)** the volume scope is LOCAL. Both of these cases are already covered by the if statement previous to the removed line in this PR.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (ScopeType.HOST.equals(currentPool.getScope()) || isStorageCrossClusterMigration(plan.getClusterId(), currentPool)) {\r\n                createVolumeToStoragePoolMappingIfPossible(profile, plan, volumeToPoolObjectMap, volume, currentPool);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [X] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nMigrate VM with Root disk in local storage.\r\n\r\nTests have been done via the UI as well as the API. Also, it considered on both cases:\r\nA. User does not provide volumes, just the VM ID, and HostID;\r\nB. User provides VM ID, and HostID, and a volume map, e.g. `migrateto[0].volume=71f43cd6-69b0-4d3b-9fbc-67f50963d60b&migrateto[0].pool=a382f181-3d2b-4413-b92d-b8931befa7e1&migrateto[1].volume=88de0173-55c0-4c1c-a269-83d0279eeedf&migrateto[1].pool=95d6e97c-6766-4d67-9a30-c449c15011d1`.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the volume map has been done accordingly with the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nVMs that fail to be migrated, have been successfully migrated and only the correct volume was migrated; data

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows migration of public templates that are created from snapshots / volumes. Data migration across secondary stores initially excluded all public templates on the pretext that public templates are automatically synced when a new image store is added; however, this assumption isn't true for templates marked as \"public\" when created from snapshots / volumes. Such templates can be identified if their url is null\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nInitial Behavior:\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nAdd router links to the notification list - which aids in traversing to the respective resource in case of failed jobs/ operations. This was added as part of #5034; however, during recent refactor of the UI around header notices, this minor enhancement was reverted. This PR also brings back the old behavior of showing the error description in the notification list so that one may not have to filter through events to see the reason for a failure\r\n\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nWhen the host and last host ID is not set for the VM, it may appear in the list of unmanaged instances.\r\nThis change fixes the behaviour by filtering unmanaged instances list for the host for the following three criteria:\r\n- host is set as host_id for the VM\r\n- host is set as the last_host_id for the VM\r\n- pod of the host is set as the pod_id for the VM and both host_id

Description\r\n\r\nPR https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/5337 added a check to bypass username / password check for a specific hypervisor type, however, Simulator envs leverage discoverHosts ( https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/resource/ResourceManagerImpl.java#L643 ) for simulating addition of a secondary store, wherein \"SecondaryStorage\" is passed as hypervisor type and this leads to a failure at https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/resource/ResourceManagerImpl.java#L692 - i.e., the username and password check fails which in turn leads to the template properties - \"size\" not being set at https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/plugins/hypervisors/simulator/src/main/java/com/cloud/resource/SimulatorSecondaryDiscoverer.java#L77. Thus, we have been noticing a few travis failures:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+------------------------+--------------------+-------+------------------------+\r\n|          Test          |       Result       | Time  |       Test file        |\r\n+========================+====================+=======+========================+\r\n\r\n| test_00_deploy_vm_root | builtins.TypeError | 0.001 | test_deploy_vm_root_re |\r\n| _resize                |                    |       | size                   |\r\n+------------------------+--------------------+-------+------------------------+\r\n\r\n| test_02_deploy_vm_root | builtins.TypeError | 0     | test_deploy_vm_root_re |\r\n| _resize                |                    |       | size                   |\r\n+------------------------+--------------------+-------+------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n+------------------------+--------------------+-------+------------------------+\r\n|          Test          |       Result       | Time  |       Test file        |\r\n+========================+====================+=======+========================+\r\n| test_01_reset_vm_on_re | builtins.Exception | 1.129 | test_reset_vm_on_reboo |\r\n| boot                   |                    |       | t                      |\r\n+------------------------+--------------------+-------+------------------------+\r\n```\r\nThis PR fixes the above mentioned issue\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nRan the specific tests on a simulator based env and they passed\r\n```\r\n$ nosetests --with-xunit --xunit-file=results.xml --with-marvin --marvin-config=setup/dev/advanced.cfg -s -a tags=xx --hypervisor=simulator test/integration/smoke/test_deploy_vm_root_resize.py \r\n\r\n==== Marvin Init Started ====\r\n\r\n=== Marvin Parse Config Successful ===\r\n\r\n=== Marvin Setting TestData Successful===\r\n\r\n==== Log Folder Path: /tmp/MarvinLogs/Sep_01_2021_18_53_26_ZLX8G2.
