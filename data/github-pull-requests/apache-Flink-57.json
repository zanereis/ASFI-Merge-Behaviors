you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- Updating AWS SDK dependencies to latest versions to pull recent bug fixes and add support for new AWS regions.\r\n- Removing the dependency on AWS `Regions` enum (for AWS SDK v1) so that region support for new AWS regions is automatic, and wouldn't need a PR.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20476 and https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20496 from `1.16` to `1.13`.\r\n\r\nUpgrading dependencies:\r\n* AWS SDK v2 from `2.16.86` to `2.17.247`\r\n* AWS SDK v1 from `1.12.7` to `1.12.276`\r\n* Kinesis Consumer Library from `1.11.1` to `1.14.8`\r\n* Kinesis Producer Library from `0.14.0` to `0.14.1`\r\n\r\nFor the following connectors/formats:\r\n* Kinesis Data Streams\r\n* Kinesis Data Firehose\r\n* Glue Schema Registry AVRO\r\n\r\n- Change calls from `Regions` class to calls from `RegionUtils` class\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Unit tests/e2e tests\r\n- Manual regression\r\n  - `flink-glue-schema-registry-test` :: `mvn clean test -Pe2e-travis1` (providing GSR keys)\r\n  - `flink-connector-kinesis` :: Verified with local test app (EFO source/Polling source/Sink)\r\n- Manually verified that Kinesis connector with this fix works in region not present in `Regions` enum\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- Updating AWS SDK dependencies to latest versions to pull recent bug fixes and add support for new AWS regions.\r\n- Removing the dependency on AWS `Regions` enum (for AWS SDK v1) so that region support for new AWS regions is automatic, and wouldn't need a PR.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20476 and https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20496 from `1.16` to `1.14`.\r\n\r\nUpgrading dependencies:\r\n* AWS SDK v2 from `2.16.86` to `2.17.247`\r\n* AWS SDK v1 from `1.12.7` to `1.12.276`\r\n* Kinesis Consumer Library from `1.14.1` to `1.14.8`\r\n\r\nFor the following connectors/formats:\r\n* Kinesis Data Streams\r\n* Kinesis Data Firehose\r\n* Glue Schema Registry AVRO\r\n\r\n- Change calls from `Regions` class to calls from `RegionUtils` class\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Unit tests/e2e tests\r\n- Manual regression\r\n  - `flink-glue-schema-registry-test` :: `mvn clean test -Pe2e-travis1` (providing GSR keys)\r\n  - `flink-connector-kinesis` :: Verified with local test app (EFO source/Polling source/Sink)\r\n- Manually verified that Kinesis connector with this fix works in region not present in `Regions` enum\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- Updating AWS SDK dependencies to latest versions to pull recent bug fixes and add support for new AWS regions.\r\n- Removing the dependency on AWS `Regions` enum (for AWS SDK v1) so that region support for new AWS regions is automatic, and wouldn't need a PR.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20476 and https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20496 from `1.16` to `1.15`.\r\n\r\nUpgrading dependencies:\r\n* AWS SDK v2 from `2.17.52` to `2.17.247`\r\n* AWS SDK v1 from `1.12.7` to `1.12.276`\r\n* Kinesis Consumer Library from `1.14.7` to `1.14.8`\r\n\r\nFor the following connectors/formats:\r\n* Kinesis Data Streams\r\n* Kinesis Data Firehose\r\n* Glue Schema Registry JSON\r\n* Glue Schema Registry AVRO\r\n\r\n- Change calls from `Regions` class to calls from `RegionUtils` class\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Unit tests/e2e tests\r\n- Manual regression\r\n  - `flink-glue-schema-registry-avro-test` :: `mvn clean test -Prun-end-to-end-tests` (providing GSR keys)\r\n  - `flink-glue-schema-registry-json-test` :: `mvn clean test -Prun-end-to-end-tests` (providing GSR keys)\r\n  - `flink-connector-kinesis` :: Verified with local test app (EFO source/Polling source/Sink)\r\n- Manually verified that Kinesis connector with this fix works in region not present in `Regions` enum\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T10:48:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T21:36:56Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T21:36:52Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T21:36:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"c124872de681ef3f0ea5e7431bb4d33368228f86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1f8a8f1251eb71a28924a3e2368b296fd8b63a9e","head":{"label":"dannycranmer:FLINK-28094-1.15","ref":"FLINK-28094-1.15","sha":"1f8a8f1251eb71a28924a3e2368b296fd8b63a9e","user":{"login":"dannycranmer","id":4950503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTA1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4950503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer","html_url":"https://github.com/dannycranmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":278028335,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzgwMjgzMzU=","name":"flink","full_name":"dannycranmer/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dannycranmer","id":4950503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTA1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4950503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer","html_url":"https://github.com/dannycranmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dannycranmer/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo fix 'Table.INDEX_TABLE' not found in the Hive3 error (It's because hive3 removed this table type).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - fix reference of enum constants of TableType to literal string.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `ThriftObjectConversionsTest#testHiveTableTypeToFlinkTableKind`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T09:04:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-15T14:32:29Z","closed_at":"2022-08-13T02:53:32Z","merged_at":"2022-08-13T02:53:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"1232629c80cbb64eb4ca9f6c95d6c5c1a2e8e82d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/25fce4f907f9bcbf9f798a2d7383b2fc347a4d6b","head":{"label":"yuzelin:map-error-fix","ref":"map-error-fix","sha":"25fce4f907f9bcbf9f798a2d7383b2fc347a4d6b","user":{"login":"yuzelin","id":33053040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDUzMDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33053040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin","html_url":"https://github.com/yuzelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":517571327,"node_id":"R_kgDOHtmC_w","name":"flink","full_name":"yuzelin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yuzelin","id":33053040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDUzMDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33053040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin","html_url":"https://github.com/yuzelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuzelin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yuzelin/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pr is aims to add document for introduce join hints for batch sql.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adding join hints contents in `hint.md`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNo test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  no\r\n  - The serializers:  no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:  no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? yes, this pr is a document.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T08:43:51Z","updated_at":"2022-09-04T13:19:30Z","closed_at":"2022-09-04T13:19:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b0b1d0d8ab737da207e9dae4c9dd3711ec5a53e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c35578c378d7fc8cc7ad8598891609e9b1418236","head":{"label":"swuferhong:FLINK-28858","ref":"FLINK-28858","sha":"c35578c378d7fc8cc7ad8598891609e9b1418236","user":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373063159,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzMwNjMxNTk=","name":"flink","full_name":"swuferhong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDisable the unstable CacheITCase\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Disable the unstable CacheITCase\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-09T08:43:38Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T09:27:31Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T08:58:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a17f6a81d04fc7f85c3897e9f916894c217a5cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20512/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20512/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20512/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c41815eff54f95e1cc3926057fe8fb32232eec02","head":{"label":"Sxnan:FLINK-28860","ref":"FLINK-28860","sha":"c41815eff54f95e1cc3926057fe8fb32232eec02","user":{"login":"Sxnan","id":12155662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU1NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12155662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan","html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187957720,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc5NTc3MjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"Sxnan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Sxnan","id":12155662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU1NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12155662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan","html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pr is aims to add document for \"ANALYZE TABLE\" syntax to introduce it's syntax and usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adding a new markdown file named `analyze.md` to introduce \"ANALYZE TABLE\" syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNo test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? yes, this pr is a document.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-08T16:11:24Z","updated_at":"2022-08-25T09:05:46Z","closed_at":"2022-08-25T09:05:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6eb04fd98a346b7706668d2739a350078045adb1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b95e1a6f50e2741ff6ab56208cccf9d8518ad4af","head":{"label":"swuferhong:FLINK-28493","ref":"FLINK-28493","sha":"b95e1a6f50e2741ff6ab56208cccf9d8518ad4af","user":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373063159,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzMwNjMxNTk=","name":"flink","full_name":"swuferhong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen using Pulsar Source to consume data, if the data rate is small, e.g. 2 msg/s, there will be long periods of time when no messages are consumed.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the default `PulsarSourceOptions.PULSAR_MAX_FETCH_TIME` and `PulsarSourceOptions.PULSAR_MAX_FETCH_RECORDS` options. Pulsar Source will try to pull messages until any conditions exceed. Such as fetch until 100 messages or fetch 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nWe have to add a new fetch time option for Pulsar Source. We would consider there is no message on the current topic if this fetch time exceeds. This would make sure the source would stop fetching messages when the 100ms exceed. Avoid hanging on small message income rates.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add new `PulsarSourceOptions.PULSAR_DEFAULT_FETCH_TIME` option.\r\n  - Change the polling timeout to `PulsarSourceOptions.PULSAR_DEFAULT_FETCH_TIME`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *PulsarOrderedPartitionSplitReaderTest*, *PulsarUnorderedPartitionSplitReaderTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nA continue work for #20422 .\r\n\r\nCurrently the statistics information about tables can only be fetched from the catalog by each given partition iteratively. Since getting statistics information from catalogs is a very heavy operation, in order to improve the query performance, we’d better provide functionality to fetch the statistics information of a table for all given partitions in one shot.\r\n\r\nBased on the manual performance test, for 2000 partitions, the cost will be improved from 10s to 2s. The improvement result is 500%.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  -   Implementations for new added methods will be done in all classes that implement the Catalog interface.\r\n  -  For the concrete HiveCatalog, HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION will be taken care of while fetching the column statistics. - - All currently supported types for partition column will be taken into consideration.\r\n  - The logic of getting TableStates in FlinkRecomputeStatisticsProgram will be optimized from calling the catalog iteratively to bulk fetch.\r\n  - Logic of TableStates conversion will be consolidated into the CatalogTableStatisticsConverter class to make the domain design a little bit cleaner.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nAdded test in `HiveCatalogHiveMetadataTest` and `GenericInMemoryCatalogTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPulsarSink is a bit slow when we use the `At-Least-Once` or `Exactly-Once`. This is because PulsarSink uses `MallboxExecutor` to write messages. A lot of useless context switches and locks acquire happened when using this writing policy. We should drop `MallboxExecutor` and send messages directly for better performance.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Deprecated useless `PulsarSinkOptions.PULSAR_MAX_PENDING_MESSAGES_ON_PARALLELISM` option.\r\n  - Remove the use of `MallboxExecutor` in `PulsarWriter`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *PulsarWriterTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

this PR, we introduces several things for supporting create another k8s resources before JM deploy creation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\nFor supporting customized k8s scheduler, we need to extend the ability of current code tree to support the cases of all customized k8s scheduler during they schedule the real pods. So we'd better to extend all cases during k8s scheduling, such as before/during/after our target resources creation. In this PR, we add the `before` case. And current code tree had covered during/after cases.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. We introduce a new interface func for all decorators to support\r\n   create pre-prepared k8s resources.\r\n2. We extend a attribute for JM spec for storing the resources list.\r\n3. Extending the ability for supporting refresh the preprepared\r\n   resource's ownerreference based on original code logic.\r\n4. Add the ability for creating K8S resource before JM deployment\r\n   creation in Fabric client.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nWe can not verify this change at this moment, as this is a internal process in flink-kubernetes now. It doesn't affect the user interface now. The only way we can test it is mocking a JM spec with another k8s resources which is not contained by Flink. And check whether the resources can be created before the JM and refresh the correct ower reference(Flink cluster id-- deployment id).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR forces the output edges of DynamicFilteringDataCollector to be blocking, thus ensures the task finished before the fact source get scheduled. \r\n\r\nThis is done by inserts the BatchExecExchange between all the output edges from BatchExecDynamicFilteringDataCollector and its precedent tasks. Note that currently once two tasks are connected via pipeline regions, it would be divided into the same region and the blocking edge would not work, thus we have to make all the parents' output edges to be blocking. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- e57d925f6f4c4970004bb28f9e1b506869aabc9c does the above change.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added tests that are BatchExecExchange is inserted correctly.\r\n- Added ITCases to demonstrate the blocking edge works correctly. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:

Unit tests/e2e tests\r\n- Manually verified that Kinesis connector with this fix works in region not present in `Regions` enum\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement `GetColumns/GetPrimaryKeys/GetTableTypes` in the `HiveServer2Endpoint`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Implement `getTable` in the `SqlGatewayService`.\r\n  - Implement `GetColumns` in the `HiveServer2Endpoint`.\r\n  - Implement `GetTableTypes` in the `HiveServer2Endpoint`.\r\n  - Implement `GetPrimaryKeys` in the `HiveServer2Endpoint`.\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Add test of `getTable` in the `SqlGatewayServiceITCase`.\r\n  - Add tests of `GetColumns` in the `HiveServer2EndpointITCase`.\r\n  - Add tests of `GetTableTypes` in the `HiveServer2EndpointITCase`. \r\n  - Add tests of `GetPrimaryKeys` in the `HiveServer2EndPointITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd Document for DataStream Cache API.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add Document for DataStream Cache API\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-08T07:24:06Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T15:36:52Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T15:36:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"caa073e238987b746015721e5894da8d4294ad79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5e1c295059dbff52fa0fdcb0b45dfc4ccad4dacc","head":{"label":"Sxnan:FLINK-28857","ref":"FLINK-28857","sha":"5e1c295059dbff52fa0fdcb0b45dfc4ccad4dacc","user":{"login":"Sxnan","id":12155662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU1NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12155662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan","html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187957720,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc5NTc3MjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"Sxnan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Sxnan","id":12155662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTU1NjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12155662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan","html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sxnan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Sxnan/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Based on TPC-DS test, we found that hybrid shuffle can't schedule the graph contains blocking edge. The reason is that some batch operators will forcibly set the exchange mode to blocking, which breaks ALL_ EDGE_HYBRID‘s constraint and may cause scheduling deadlock. We should use a better way to support the scheduling of all kinds of edges, including hybrid edge.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Migrate `PipelinedRegionSchedulingStrategyTest` and `StrategyTestUtil` to Junit5 and AssertJ.*\r\n  - *`PipelinedRegionSchedulingStrategy` supports all `ResultPartitionType`.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests in

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates the documentation about changing changelog from enabling to disabling.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Update `state_backends.md`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a documentation update without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-08T03:47:43Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T21:49:18Z","closed_at":"2022-08-08T21:49:18Z","merged_at":"2022-08-08T21:49:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"15e60e6cc5f947f6f71151a01f0c98166ef6649e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20486/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20486/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20486/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/43d33868eed0954ec3d1ce1ab2be4584e2a4b5fc","head":{"label":"masteryhx:FIX-CHANGELOG-DOC","ref":"FIX-CHANGELOG-DOC","sha":"43d33868eed0954ec3d1ce1ab2be4584e2a4b5fc","user":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":436096625,"node_id":"R_kgDOGf5OcQ","name":"flink","full_name":"masteryhx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* The change implements FLIP-217 (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-217+Support+watermark+alignment+of+source+splits) to support watermark alignment of source splits.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Revised `SplitFetcher` threading model and add support to pause/resume `SplitFetcher`\r\n* Adds support for watermark alignment of individual source splits controlled by `SourceOperator`\r\n* Adds support for split watermark alignment for Kafka and Pulsar sources\r\n* Adds configuration parameter to allow unaligned splits as migration plan to support legacy sources that lack support for split alignment\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added and extended tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n* `SplitFetcherTest` extended to test pause/resume of`SplitFetcher`\r\n* `SourceOperatorSplitWatermarkAlignmentTest` added to test split alignment based on split reader watermarks\r\n* `SplitFetcherPauseResumeSplitReaderITCase` added to test pause/resume of individual split readers\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **yes** (according to FLIP-217)\r\n  - The serializers:

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nEnable Hive source verctor reading for complex data with  parquet format.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- When it's ARRAY/MAP/ROW, `isVectorizationUnsupported` change to return fa;se since Flink's parquet format has supported these types.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nIT in [HiveTableSourceITCase#testReadParquetComplexDataType](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20481/files#diff-e7e74972bb3dbbd76ce12f31dd2315433102943a1bf6ae15deac4f648cfc228aR161)\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Implement the `GetFunctions` in the `HiveServer2Endpoint`.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Allow to `getUserDefinedFunctions/getSystemFunction` and `getFunctionDefinition` in the `SqlGatewayService`*\r\n  - *Implement the `GetFunctions` in the `HiveServer2Endpoint`.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added test in the `SqlGateayServiceITCase`*\r\n  - *Added test in the `HiveServer2EndpointITCase`*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement getSchemas in the HiveServer2 Endpoint.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Implement getTable in the SqlGatewayService.\r\n  - Implement GetColumns in the HiveServer2 Endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n - Added get table in the SqlGatewayServiceITCase.\r\n - Use jdbc to fetch all columns within given catalog/databases/tables in the HiveServer2EndpointITCase.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdding a way to configure `client.id.prefix` for the KafkaSink, which, internally, configures `client.id` for the KafkaProducer. This implementation essentially copies the implementation of `client.id.prefix` in KafkaSource.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a new `CLIENT_ID_PREFIX` for the KafkaSink\r\n- Added a way to configure it for the KafkaSink\r\n- Updated KafkaWriter to use `CLIENT_ID_PREFIX` with the subtaskId to generate a `client.id` for the KafkaProducer\r\n- Also updated the documentation and added a test\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added a unit test and can be verified by running `KafkaWriterITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The

this PR test dependencies required on the python side are mostly setup via maven. The python module has dependencies on all required dependencies (ensuring they are actually built beforehand), and copies the require jars into `target/test-dependencies` where they are picked up by the `pyflink_gateway_server`.\r\n\r\nThis also makes these dependencies more discoverable; previously python could fail out of nowhere if some dependency was missing, and it was not obvious where it had to be added.","created_at":"2022-08-05T11:07:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T14:20:54Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T02:23:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf3ea53dd6d102686082da3cb3f1a79225c48d42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0Njc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=BuildSystem","name":"component=BuildSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20470/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20470/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20470/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e434a5482615f59a1c430354d75cd4b4935187ef","head":{"label":"zentol:28183","ref":"28183","sha":"e434a5482615f59a1c430354d75cd4b4935187ef","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zentol/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n Allow to GetTypeInfo for HiveServer2 Endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-05T08:59:16Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T02:26:40Z","closed_at":"2022-08-08T02:26:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d20bc4be45af855bc7b7fa817c78c968b83b48d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20468/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20468/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20468/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9e36e2089a5ea6024bd1652e24bcd3ad7311bb7b","head":{"label":"chaozwn:newTypeInfo","ref":"newTypeInfo","sha":"9e36e2089a5ea6024bd1652e24bcd3ad7311bb7b","user":{"login":"chaozwn","id":51357674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzU3Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51357674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn","html_url":"https://github.com/chaozwn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325162057,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjUxNjIwNTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"chaozwn/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chaozwn","id":51357674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzU3Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51357674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn","html_url":"https://github.com/chaozwn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chaozwn/flink","description":"Apache

introduce 3 options for supporting specify the K8S pod scheduler\r\nname.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\nThis change is introduced by FLIP-250 for supporting specify pod scheduler name by users. This PR introduces 3 options for it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nNew options are:\r\nkubernetes.jobmanager.scheduler-name\r\nkubernetes.taskmanager.scheduler-name\r\nkubernetes.scheduler-name\r\n\r\nThe first two of them can be specified by users to control the k8s pod\r\nscheduler they used for jobmanager and taskmanager. The last one is the\r\nfallback one, the first two options will overwrite it.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nKubernetes deployment support 3 new options now. Can check the backend pods scheduler name whether is the same with the specified one.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-05T08:57:50Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T12:06:38Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1d88556e9b868f6ee7c85033bee7491dbce92d66","head":{"label":"bzhaoopenstack:upstream-scheduler-name","ref":"upstream-scheduler-name","sha":"1d88556e9b868f6ee7c85033bee7491dbce92d66","user":{"login":"bzhaoopenstack","id":11386522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzg2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11386522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack","html_url":"https://github.com/bzhaoopenstack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":406681532,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDY2ODE1MzI=","name":"flink","full_name":"bzhaoopenstack/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bzhaoopenstack","id":11386522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzg2NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11386522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack","html_url":"https://github.com/bzhaoopenstack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzhaoopenstack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bzhaoopenstack/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, when reading data in SortMergeResultPartitionReadScheduler, the reader is added to the priority queue immediately. However, the data read from this reader may not have been consumed, which will cause this reader to be ranked later in the queue, which is unfavorable to sequential reading.\r\n\r\nTo solve the issue, After reading the data, we should sort all unfinished readers in batches at one time, that is, add all unfinished readers to the priority queue, which is more conducive to sequential reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Sorting all unfinished readers in batches at one time in SortMergeResultPartitionReadScheduler*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *SortMergeResultPartitionReadSchedulerTest*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pr is a part of FLIP-248, [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-248%3A+Introduce+dynamic+partition+pruning](url). In this pr, we try to adjust join cost for dpp query pattern to reorder join order to make fact table adjacent to dim table directly.  For example, for query `Select * from fact_table, sales, items, dim_table where fact_table.fact_partition_key = dim_table.dim_date_key and xxx and dim_table.price > 100` , it meets the dpp's requirements, but `fact_table` is not adjacent to `dim_table`. So we try to change the join order to make fact table adjacent to dim table directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adding util class `DynamicPartitionPruningUtils`, which include methods for judging whether one join meets dpp pattern, and abstract some util methods `DynamicPartitionPruningRule` and DPP factor both used.\r\n- In `FlinkRelMdRowCount`, adding adjust join cost logical while join meets dpp pattern.\r\n- Adding dpp factor related plan tests in `DynamicPartitionPruningRuleTest`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Adding dpp factor related plan tests in `DynamicPartitionPruningRuleTest`. Include basic test and test while join key (partition key) changed in dim side.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n##

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen recycling buffers in BatchShuffleReadBufferPool, the number of buffers may be larger than numBuffersPerRequest, which may cause too frequent notifications that the buffers are already available.\r\n\r\nSo we should modify the condition of notifications that the buffer is available to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Modify the condition of notifications that the buffer is available in BatchShuffleReadBufferPool*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *BatchShuffleReadBufferPoolTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes /  **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes /  **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes /  **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes /  **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes /  **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes /  **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe num of the max requested buffers in SortMergeResultPartitionReadScheduler is determined by the num of subpartitions, which may be insufficient in some scenarios, such as speculative execution and partition reuse.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should increase the max requested buffers to make full use of available memory when TM memory is sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Enlarge the max requested buffers for SortMergeResultPartitionReadScheduler*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *SortMergeResultPartitionReadSchedulerTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes /  **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes /  **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes /  **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes /  **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes /  **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes /  **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, for sort blocking shuffle, the corresponding data readers read shuffle data in buffer granularity. Before compression, each buffer is 32K by default, after compression the size will become smaller (may less than 10K). For file IO, this is pretty smaller.\r\n\r\nTo achieve better performance and reduce IOPS, we can read more data per IO read request and parse buffer header and data in memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Read a full buffer of data per file IO read request for sort-shuffle.*\r\n  - *Migrate PartitionedFileWriteReadTest to Junit5/AssertJ.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *SortMergeResultPartitionTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn hybrid shuffle mode, subpartition view lock will be acquired by consumer thread, and further wait the read lock of MemoryDataManager. But MemoryDataManager may acquire write lock to make a global spilling decision, and then wait subpartition view lock to get consuming offset. In this case, deadlock will occurs.\r\n\r\nconsumer thread : acqurie subpartition lock -> wait read lock.\r\n\r\nupstream thread  : acquire write lock -> wait subpartition lock.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *FileDataManager get consuming offset with lock.*\r\n  - *MemoryDataManager get consuming offset without lock*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of #20275, further guaranteeing the consistency of operator events sent from subtasks to their coordinators. A coordinator would notify its subtasks to close their gateways before it starts doing checkpoints, and when the subtasks' gateways are closed, events sent from a subtask to the coordinator would be temporarily blocked and buffered until the subtask completes the checkpoint. The buffered events would be stored into snapshots in cases of fail-overs.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a component of FLINK-26029, which aims to generalize the checkpoint protocol of operator coordinators and makes coordinators applicable for non-source operators as well.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- The coordinator would notify its subtasks to close their gateways when the coordinator starts checkpointing, and wait until ACKs are received from all subtasks before it actually starts doing the checkpoint.\r\n- A subtask would close its gateway when it receives the notification mentioned above from its coordinator, and send back ACK events.\r\n- A subtask would reopen its gateway when the subtask completes a snapshot.\r\n- Events being sent from a subtask while the subtask's gateway is closed will be temporarily blocked and be actually sent out when the gateway is reopened.\r\n- Blocked events are saved into and restored from snapshots.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added unit tests to verify the correctness of the closing/reopening behavior of subtask gateways.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n    - This PR additionally blocks the communication between a coordinator and its subtasks from when checkpoint barriers are sent to sources to when subtasks complete the checkpoint. This means that an operator event generated during checkpoints would be delivered only after the target subtask completes the checkpoint, bringing longer latency to that event.\r\n\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n    - This PR affects the latency of operator events from coordinators to subtasks, as described above.\r\n\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)","created_at":"2022-08-04T11:21:28Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T12:06:36Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20454/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20454/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20454/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4f1487a214b87a95c6941a2ef90da46ebfd3f60f","head":{"label":"yunfengzhou-hub:FLINK-28639","ref":"FLINK-28639","sha":"4f1487a214b87a95c6941a2ef90da46ebfd3f60f","user":{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":360814046,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjA4MTQwNDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"yunfengzhou-hub/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Introduce the operation related api in sql gateway*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce operation related handlers and message headers*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for operation related apis*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpgrade the Aliyun OSS SDK version to 3.13.2 \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUpgrade the Aliyun OSS SDK version to 3.13.2 and the associated dependencies to the right versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change does not include any code changes, but we should run regression tests. In order to run tests, someone need to have his own Aliyun access key id and access key secret. Then, set environment variables below：\r\n`export ARTIFACTS_OSS_ENDPOINT=<Aliyun OSS endpoint to connect to>`\r\n`export ARTIFACTS_OSS_BUCKET=<Your bucket>`\r\n`export ARTIFACTS_OSS_ACCESS_KEY=<Your access key id>`\r\n`export ARTIFACTS_OSS_SECRET_KEY=<Your access secret>`\r\n\r\nThese tests are skipped by default.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces support of lookup join using FullCachingLookupProvider that uses InputFormats for data loading.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add `LookupFullCache` as an implementation of interface `LookupCache`, therefore full caching logic is located in the same place as partial caching logic (CachingLookupFunction)\r\n- There are 2 copies of full caches (old and new) at the process of reloading, so no blocking is required, but on the other hand, it requires twice more memory.\r\n- Reloading happens in another thread. If exception will be thrown from this thread, main thread will also stop.\r\n- If there are more than one InputSplit from InputFormat, reloading will be performed in parallel. Total number of threads for reloading = min(numOfSplit, numOfCores).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- 'org.apache.flink.table.planner.runtime.batch.sql.join.LookupJoinITCase' - Batch IT tests that should work the same way with full caching as with NONE and PARTIAL caching.\r\n- 'org.apache.flink.table.planner.runtime.stream.sql.LookupJoinITCase' - Streaming IT tests that should work the same way with full caching as with NONE and PARTIAL caching.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-04T04:56:18Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T21:12:30Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T21:12:30Z","merged_at":"2022-08-09T21:12:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"10a6f41fa12284f15af55c359c0c0954800f02de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20447/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20447/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20447/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d5de95ad162945043dad8c1d8e4aefc3e7bae0d5","head":{"label":"SmirAlex:FLINK-28532","ref":"FLINK-28532","sha":"d5de95ad162945043dad8c1d8e4aefc3e7bae0d5","user":{"login":"SmirAlex","id":52520363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIwMzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52520363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex","html_url":"https://github.com/SmirAlex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":516610685,"node_id":"R_kgDOHsrafQ","name":"flink","full_name":"SmirAlex/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SmirAlex","id":52520363,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIwMzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52520363?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex","html_url":"https://github.com/SmirAlex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SmirAlex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SmirAlex/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nFix unstable test for HiveDialectQueryITCase#testInsertDirectory\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nWait the inserting finish before querying the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nallow to GetInfo for HiveServer2 Endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests,.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-04T02:55:44Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T12:13:14Z","closed_at":"2022-08-08T12:13:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c781e4ba6b99dcbf9583a8939a8cee325cf9dcdd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cecae3ebee51d03ec229afa45e75990c62b2bb19","head":{"label":"chaozwn:getInfo","ref":"getInfo","sha":"cecae3ebee51d03ec229afa45e75990c62b2bb19","user":{"login":"chaozwn","id":51357674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzU3Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51357674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn","html_url":"https://github.com/chaozwn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325162057,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjUxNjIwNTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"chaozwn/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chaozwn","id":51357674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzU3Njc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51357674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn","html_url":"https://github.com/chaozwn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaozwn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chaozwn/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-03T12:49:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T12:06:32Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20441/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20441/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20441/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a498fbc504487a77070e248a644bbd22912bebb0","head":{"label":"luoyuxia:FLINK-27850-1","ref":"FLINK-27850-1","sha":"a498fbc504487a77070e248a644bbd22912bebb0","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344411200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ0MTEyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"luoyuxia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement getTables in the HiveServer2 Endpoint.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Implement listTables in the SqlGatewayService.\r\n  - Implement GetTables in the HiveServer2 Endpoint.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added list all tables in the `SqlGatewayServiceITCase`.\r\n  - Use jdbc to fetch all tables (matching catalog/database/table name patterns) in the `HiveServer2EndpointITCase`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\ntransalte ops/debugging/debugging_classloading page into Chinese.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-03T07:10:16Z","updated_at":"2022-08-03T07:10:56Z","closed_at":"2022-08-03T07:10:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"459c32c89a8a705ebd0720d49b56ac0e83bcdd4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20430/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20430/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20430/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/aba325808a8433c57099d7df53969c7b38a0d5e0","head":{"label":"hililiwei:beam-version","ref":"beam-version","sha":"aba325808a8433c57099d7df53969c7b38a0d5e0","user":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":248400647,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDg0MDA2NDc=","name":"flink","full_name":"hililiwei/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hililiwei","id":59213263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjEzMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59213263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei","html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hililiwei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hililiwei/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*In hybrid shuffle mode, there are currently two strategies to control spilling. For the full spilling strategy, the data is guaranteed to be persistent to the disk after task finished. When a failover occurs, if the upstream has been finished, the data should be recovered directly from the disk file without re-compute. For selective spilling strategy, the entire topology must be restarted.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Split HYBRID result partition type to HYBRID_FULL and HYBRID_SELECTIVE.*\r\n  - *RestartPipelinedRegionFailoverStrategy takes reConsumable into account when decide partition available.*\r\n  - *Remove WIP prefix of ALL_EXCHANGE_HYBRID_FULL and ALL_EXCHANGE_HYBRID_SELECTIVE in BatchShuffleMode and expose them to documents.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added new test methods in related test class.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one
