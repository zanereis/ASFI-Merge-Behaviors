Pushdown LeftSemi/LeftAnti over Aggregate will affect performance.\r\n2. It will remove user added DISTINCT operator, e.g.: [q38](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/resources/tpcds/q38.sql), [q87](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/resources/tpcds/q87.sql).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup PR for SPARK-33690 (#30647) .\r\nIn addition to the original PR, this PR intends to escape the following meta-characters in `Dataset#showString`.\r\n\r\n  * `\\r` (carrige ret)\r\n  * `\\f` (form feed)\r\n  * `\\b` (backspace)\r\n  * `\\u000B` (vertical tab)\r\n  * `\\^G` (bell)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid breaking the layout of `Dataset#showString`.\r\n`\\^G` does not break the layout of `Dataset#showString` but it's noisy (beeps for each row) so it should be also escaped.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR modify TableReader.scala to create OldHadoopRDD when inputformat is 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HiveHBaseTableInputFormat', beacuse  NewHadoopRDD uses the new MapReduce API (`org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce`),but some initialization operations for hbase are implemented using the older MapReduce API (`org.apache.hadoop.mapred`),this makes the default NewHadoopRDD  can not access hbase table.Therefore, in order to be compatible with implementation classes similar to 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HiveHBaseTableInputFormat' that uses the old API and the new API, it should be prioritized whether to create OldHadoopRDD.\r\nThis PR is similar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29178\r\n\r\nReference link： https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32380\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSparksql cannot access hive table while data in hbase, want to fixed this bug.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- step 1 create hbase table\r\n> hbase(main):001:0>create 'hive_hbase_test', 'f'  <br>\r\n hbase(main):001:0> put 'hive_hbase_test', 'r1', 'f:c1', '123'\r\n- step 2 create hive table mapping to hbase table\r\n> CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `test.hbase_test`(<br>\r\n  `key` string COMMENT '', <br>\r\n  `value` string COMMENT '')<br>\r\nSTORED BY<br>\r\n'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseStorageHandler' <br>\r\nWITH SERDEPROPERTIES ( <br>\r\n  'hbase.columns.mapping'=':key,f:c1', <br>\r\n  'serialization.format'='1')<br>\r\nTBLPROPERTIES (<br>\r\n  'hbase.table.name'='hive_hbase_test')\r\n- step 3 using spark-sql cli to query data in hive\r\n> spark-sql> select * from test.hbase_test limit 1;\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR takes over https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28780.\r\n\r\n1. Counted the spilled memory size when creating the `UnsafeExternalSorter` with the existing `InMemorySorter`\r\n\r\n2. Accumulate the `totalSpillBytes` when merging two `UnsafeExternalSorter`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28780:\r\n\r\n> It happends when hash aggregate downgrades to sort based aggregate.\r\n`UnsafeExternalSorter.createWithExistingInMemorySorter` calls spill on an `InMemorySorter` immediately, but the memory pointed by `InMemorySorter` is acquired by outside `BytesToBytesMap`, instead the allocatedPages in `UnsafeExternalSorter`. So the memory spill bytes metric is always 0, but disk bytes spill metric is right.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR also fixes the `UnsafeExternalSorter.merge` by accumulating the `totalSpillBytes` of two sorters. Thus, we can report the correct spilled size in `HashAggregateExec.finishAggregate`.\r\n\r\nIssues can be reproduced by the following step by checking the SQL metrics in UI:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-shell --driver-memory 512m --executor-memory 512m --executor-cores 1 --conf \"spark.default.parallelism=1\"\r\nscala> sql(\"select id, count(1) from range(10000000) group by id\").write.csv(\"/tmp/result.json\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"200\" alt=\"WeChatfe5146180d91015e03b9a27852e9a443\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16397174/103625414-e6fc6280-4f75-11eb-8b93-c55095bdb5b8.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"200\" alt=\"WeChat42ab0e73c5fbc3b14c12ab85d232071d\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16397174/103625420-e8c62600-4f75-11eb-8e1f-6f5e8ab561b9.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users can see the correct spill metrics after this PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31110. I ran intelliJ inspection again in this branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR is basically a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14332. \r\nCalling `map` alone might leave it not executed due to lazy evaluation, e.g.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> val foo = Seq(1,2,3)\r\nfoo: Seq[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)\r\n\r\nscala> foo.map(println)\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\nres0: Seq[Unit] = List((), (), ())\r\n\r\nscala> foo.view.map(println)\r\nres1: scala.collection.SeqView[Unit,Seq[_]] = SeqViewM(...)\r\n\r\nscala> foo.view.foreach(println)\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should better use `foreach` to make sure it's executed where the output is unused or `Unit`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo prevent the potential issues by not executing `map`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the current codes look not causing any problem for now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI found these item by running IntelliJ inspection, double checked one by one, and fixed them. These should be all instances across the codebase

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31110. I ran intelliJ inspection again in this branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR is basically a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14332. \r\nCalling `map` alone might leave it not executed due to lazy evaluation, e.g.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> val foo = Seq(1,2,3)\r\nfoo: Seq[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)\r\n\r\nscala> foo.map(println)\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\nres0: Seq[Unit] = List((), (), ())\r\n\r\nscala> foo.view.map(println)\r\nres1: scala.collection.SeqView[Unit,Seq[_]] = SeqViewM(...)\r\n\r\nscala> foo.view.foreach(println)\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should better use `foreach` to make sure it's executed where the output is unused or `Unit`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo prevent the potential issues by not executing `map`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the current codes look not causing any problem for now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI found these item by running IntelliJ inspection, double checked one by one, and fixed them. These should be all instances across the codebase

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31110. I ran intelliJ inspection again in this branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR is basically a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14332. \r\nCalling `map` alone might leave it not executed due to lazy evaluation, e.g.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> val foo = Seq(1,2,3)\r\nfoo: Seq[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)\r\n\r\nscala> foo.map(println)\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\nres0: Seq[Unit] = List((), (), ())\r\n\r\nscala> foo.view.map(println)\r\nres1: scala.collection.SeqView[Unit,Seq[_]] = SeqViewM(...)\r\n\r\nscala> foo.view.foreach(println)\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should better use `foreach` to make sure it's executed where the output is unused or `Unit`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo prevent the potential issues by not executing `map`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the current codes look not causing any problem for now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI found these item by running IntelliJ inspection, double checked one by one, and fixed them. These should be all instances across the codebase

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis changes `CatalogImpl.dropTempView` and `CatalogImpl.dropGlobalTempView` use analyzed logical plan instead of `viewDef` which is unresolved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, `CatalogImpl.dropTempView` is implemented as following:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\noverride def dropTempView(viewName: String): Boolean = {\r\n  sparkSession.sessionState.catalog.getTempView(viewName).exists { viewDef =>\r\n    sparkSession.sharedState.cacheManager.uncacheQuery(\r\n      sparkSession, viewDef, cascade = false)\r\n    sessionCatalog.dropTempView(viewName)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, the logical plan `viewDef` is not resolved, and when passing to `uncacheQuery`, it could fail at `sameResult` call, where canonicalized plan is compared. The error message looks like:\r\n```\r\nInvalid call to qualifier on unresolved object, tree: 'key\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced via:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(s\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW $v AS SELECT key FROM src LIMIT 10\")\r\nsql(s\"CREATE TABLE $t AS SELECT * FROM src\")\r\nsql(s\"CACHE TABLE $t\")\r\ndropTempTable(v)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe only user-facing change is that, previously `SQLContext.dropTempTable` may fail in the above scenario but will work with this fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this change the old schema would be used. This can use a correctness issue when the new schema introduces \r\na new field with a default value (following the rules of schema evolution) before an existing field. \r\nIn this case the rows coming from the partition where the old schema was used will **contain values in wrong column positions**.\r\n\r\nFor example check the attached unit test `SPARK-26836: support Avro schema evolution` \r\n\r\nWithout this fix the result of the select on the table would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|      col1|      col2|        ds|\r\n+----------+----------+----------+\r\n|col2_value|      null|1981-01-07|\r\n|col1_value|col2_value|1983-04-27|\r\n+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this fix:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+------------+----------+----------+\r\n|        col1|      col2|        ds|\r\n+------------+----------+----------+\r\n|col1_default|col2_value|1981-01-07|\r\n|  col1_value|col2_value|1983-04-27|\r\n+------------+----------+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nJust fixes the value errors. \r\nWhen a new column is introduced even to the last position then instead of 'null' the given default will be used. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested with the unit tested included to the PR. \r\nAnd manually on Apache Spark / Hive.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-11T14:34:32Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T18:56:40Z","closed_at":"2021-02-05T18:56:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b50feee39652940c757a6b267d74036e0158ecd1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20dc1676da8514708a139f8e4ac66c3034ed7b5e","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-26836","ref":"SPARK-26836","sha":"20dc1676da8514708a139f8e4ac66c3034ed7b5e","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

This can avoid mismatch for the same attributes w/o this change, as the expressions returned by `executeSameContext` will change when `PaddingAndLengthCheckForCharVarchar` takes effects. W/ this change, the expressions can be matched correctly.\r\n\r\nFor those unmatched, w need to look recursively into children to find char/varchars instead of the expression itself only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

DROP PARTITION` must keep the table in the cache.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the drop partition command keeps the table in the cache while updating table stats:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"ALTER TABLE tbl DROP PARTITION (part=0)\")\r\nscala> spark.catalog.isCached(\"tbl\")\r\nres19: Boolean = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new UT:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is kind of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31104 but I decided to track it separately with a separate JIRA.\r\n\r\nCurrently the jobs are being canceled in main repo branches. If a commit is merged, for example, to master branch before the test finishes, it cancels the previous builds. This is a problem because we cannot, for example, detect logical conflict properly. We should only cancel the jobs in PRs:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-11 at 3 22 24 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/104152015-c7f04b80-5421-11eb-9e40-6b0a0e5b8442.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to don't do this in the main repo branch commits but only do it in PRs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- To keep the test coverage\r\n- To run the test in the synced master branch instead of relying on the builds made in each PR with an outdated master branch\r\n- To detect test failures from logical conflicts from merging two conflicting PRs at the same time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested in\r\n- https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/27\r\n- https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/28\r\n\r\nI added Yi Wu as a co-author since he helped verifying the current fix in the PR above.\r\n\r\nI checked that it does not cancel in the main repo

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n#24595 introduced `private val runId: UUID = UUID.randomUUID` in `BroadcastExchangeExec` to cancel the broadcast execution in the Future when timeout happens. Since the runId is a random UUID instead of inheriting the job group id, when a SQL statement is cancelled, these broadcast sub-jobs are still executing. This PR uses the job group id of the outside thread as its `runId` to abort these broadcast sub-jobs when the SQL statement is cancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen broadcasting a table takes too long and the SQL statement is cancelled. However, the background Spark job is still running and it wastes resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test.\r\nSince broadcasting a table is too fast to cancel in UT, but it is very easy to verify manually: \r\n1. Start a Spark thrift-server with less resource in YARN.\r\n2. When the driver is running but no executors are launched, submit a SQL which will broadcast tables from beeline.\r\n3. Cancel the SQL in beeline\r\n\r\nWithout the patch, broadcast sub-jobs won't be cancelled.\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-11 at 12 03 13

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReplace `USING parquet` by `$defaultUsing` which is `USING parquet` for v1 In-Memory catalog and `USING hive` for v1 Hive external

ADD PARTITION`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issues portrayed by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl (col int, part int) using parquet partitioned by (part);\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl partition (part=0) select 0;\r\nspark-sql> cache table tbl;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\nspark-sql> show table extended like 'tbl' partition(part=0);\r\ndefault\ttbl\tfalse\tPartition Values: [part=0]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/add-partition-refresh-cache-2/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0\r\n...\r\n```\r\nCreate new partition by copying the existing one:\r\n```\r\n$ cp -r /Users/maximgekk/proj/add-partition-refresh-cache-2/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0 /Users/maximgekk/proj/add-partition-refresh-cache-2/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=1\r\n```\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part=1) location '/Users/maximgekk/proj/add-partition-refresh-cache-2/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=1';\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last query must return `0\t1` since it has been added by `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes for the example above:\r\n```sql\r\n...\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part=1) location '/Users/maximgekk/proj/add-partition-refresh-cache-2/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=1';\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n0\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *CachedTableSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-01-10T17:23:40Z","updated_at":"2021-01-11T00:37:37Z","closed_at":"2021-01-11T00:37:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83d74c569a9f2bb25bff722d35d44947212a5be6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31116/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31116/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31116/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dfc0a3a354487a1274e3453a6cc77c3cbbfbf74c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:add-partition-refresh-cache-2-3.0","ref":"add-partition-refresh-cache-2-3.0","sha":"dfc0a3a354487a1274e3453a6cc77c3cbbfbf74c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

DROP PARTITION` must keep the table in the cache.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the drop partition command keeps the table in the cache while updating table stats:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"ALTER TABLE tbl DROP PARTITION (part=0)\")\r\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is basically a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14332. \r\nCalling `map` alone might leave it not executed due to lazy evaluation, e.g.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> val foo = Seq(1,2,3)\r\nfoo: Seq[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)\r\n\r\nscala> foo.map(println)\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\nres0: Seq[Unit] = List((), (), ())\r\n\r\nscala> foo.view.map(println)\r\nres1: scala.collection.SeqView[Unit,Seq[_]] = SeqViewM(...)\r\n\r\nscala> foo.view.foreach(println)\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should better use `foreach` to make sure it's executed where the output is unused or `Unit`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo prevent the potential issues by not executing `map`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the current codes look not causing any problem for now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI found these item by running IntelliJ inspection, double checked one by one, and fixed them. These should be all instances across the codebase ideally.","created_at":"2021-01-10T05:45:24Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:55:16Z","closed_at":"2021-01-10T23:23:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c505d709cbf919df41f4fb7661fecde44aa82492","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406625202,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI1MjAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MESOS","name":"MESOS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31110/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31110/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31110/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/74bc18322fe258aaed7ccb961cdd7f8fc0ad6e76","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-34059","ref":"SPARK-34059","sha":"74bc18322fe258aaed7ccb961cdd7f8fc0ad6e76","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, after creating a temporary view with `CACHE TABLE ... AS SELECT` command, the view can still be queried even after the source table is dropped or replaced (in v2). This can cause correctness issue.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the following:\r\n```sql\r\n> CREATE TABLE t ...;\r\n> CACHE TABLE v AS SELECT * FROM t;\r\n> DROP TABLE t;\r\n> SELECT * FROM v;\r\n```\r\nThe last select query still returns the old (and stale) result instead of fail. Note that the cache is already invalidated as part of dropping table `t`, but the temporary view `v` still exist.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the following:\r\n```sql\r\n> CREATE TABLE t ...;\r\n> CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t;\r\n> CACHE TABLE v;\r\n> DROP TABLE t;\r\n> SELECT * FROM v;\r\n```\r\nwill throw \"Table or view not found\" error in the last select query.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #30567 which aligns the behavior of temporary view and global view by storing the original SQL text for temporary view, as opposed to the analyzed logical plan. However, the PR only handles `CreateView` case but not the `CacheTableAsSelect` case. \r\n\r\nThis also changes uncache logic and use cascade invalidation for temporary views created above. This is to align its behavior to how a permanent view is handled as of today, and also to avoid potential issues where a dependent view becomes invalid while its data is still kept in cache.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now when `SQLConf.STORE_ANALYZED_PLAN_FOR_VIEW` is set to false (the default value), whenever a table/permanent view/temp view that a cached view depends on is dropped, the cached view itself will become invalid during analysis, i.e., user will get \"Table or view not found\" error. In addition, when the dependent is a temp view in the previous case, the cache itself will also be invalidated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

action was abandoned and is not supported (Proof: https://github.com/n1hility/cancel-previous-runs/issues/7) \r\n- this action works with forks.  The original action only worked when the contribution was run in the same repository and the action had a token with full accesses.\r\n\r\n> If you use forks, you should create a separate \"Cancelling\" workflow_run triggered workflow. The workflow_run should be responsible for all canceling actions. The examples below show the possible ways the action can be utilized.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to reduce the GitHub Action usage by cancelling the previous build.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn most case, the last commit is meaningful.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of the change, testing of this change is difficult.\r\n\r\n> Note: This event will only trigger a workflow run if the workflow file is on the default branch.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_run\r\n\r\nHowever, you can see on my fork that this action is triggered.\r\nhttps://github.com/mik-laj/spark/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Cancelling+Duplicates%22\r\n\r\nI also asked the author of this action to review this change - @potiuk (PMC of Apache Airflow) and I have a positive review.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes few issues when using encoders to serialize input/output in `ScalaUDF`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug when using encoders in Scala UDF. First, the output data type should be corrected to the corresponding data type of the object serializer. Second, `catalystConverter` should not serialize `Option[_]` as the ordinary row because in `ScalaUDF` case it is serialized to a column, not the top-level row. Otherwise, there will be a redundant `value` struct wrapping the serialized `Option[_]` object.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, fixing a bug of `ScalaUDF`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

It includes a few changes:\r\n\r\n* Only create `BlockManagerDecommissioner` instance when shuffle or RDD blocks requires migration:\r\n   there's no need to create `BlockManagerDecommissioner` instance if only `STORAGE_DECOMMISSION_ENABLED=true` and to check blocks migration in `shutdownThread`.\r\n\r\n* Shut down the migration thread more gracefully:\r\n\r\n  1. we'd better not log errors if the `BlockManagerDecommissioner.stop()` is invoked explicitly. But currently, users will see \r\n    <details>\r\n    \r\n      <summary>error message</summary>\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    21/01/04 20:11:52 ERROR BlockManagerDecommissioner: Error while waiting for block to migrate\r\n    java.lang.InterruptedException: sleep interrupted\r\n\t    at java.lang.Thread.sleep(Native Method)\r\n\t    at org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerDecommissioner$ShuffleMigrationRunnable.run(BlockManagerDecommissioner.scala:83)\r\n\t    at java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)\r\n\t    at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\t    at org.apache.spark.util.threads.SparkThreadLocalCapturingRunnable.$anonfun$run$1(SparkThreadLocalForwardingThreadPoolExecutor.scala:104)\r\n\t    at scala.runtime.java8.JFunction0$mcV$sp.apply(JFunction0$mcV$sp.java:23)\r\n\t    at org.apache.spark.util.threads.SparkThreadLocalCapturingHelper.runWithCaptured(SparkThreadLocalForwardingThreadPoolExecutor.scala:68)\r\n\t    at org.apache.spark.util.threads.SparkThreadLocalCapturingHelper.runWithCaptured$(SparkThreadLocalForwardingThreadPoolExecutor.scala:54)\r\n\t    at org.apache.spark.util.threads.SparkThreadLocalCapturingRunnable.runWithCaptured(SparkThreadLocalForwardingThreadPoolExecutor.scala:101)\r\n\t    at org.apache.spark.util.threads.SparkThreadLocalCapturingRunnable.run(SparkThreadLocalForwardingThreadPoolExecutor.scala:104)\r\n\t    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\t    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\t    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n    ```\r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n   2. don't shut down a thread pool like below since `shutdown()` actually doesn't block to wait for running tasks finish:\r\n\r\n      ```scala\r\n      executor.shutdown()\r\n      executor.shutdownNow()\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n* Avoid initiating `shuffleMigrationPool` when it's unnecessary:\r\n Currently, it's always initiated even if shuffle block migration is disabled. (`BlockManagerDecommissioner.stop()` -> `stopOffloadingShuffleBlocks()` -> initiate `shuffleMigrationPool`)\r\n\r\n* Unify the terminologies between `offload` and `migrate`: \r\n  replace `offload` with `migrate`\r\n\r\n* Do not add back the shuffle blocks when it exceeds the max failure number:\r\n   this avoids unnecessary operations\r\n\r\n* Do not try `decommissionRddCacheBlocks()` if we already know there are no available peers\r\n\r\n* Clean up logs:\r\n   Currently, we have many different description for the same thing, which is not good for the user experience\r\n\r\n* Other cleanups\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

ADD PARTITION`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issues portrayed by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl (col int, part int) using parquet partitioned by (part);\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl partition (part=0) select 0;\r\nspark-sql> cache table tbl;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\nspark-sql> show table extended like 'tbl' partition(part=0);\r\ndefault\ttbl\tfalse\tPartition Values: [part=0]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/add-partition-refresh-cache-2/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0\r\n...\r\n```\r\nCreate new partition by copying the existing one:\r\n```\r\n$ cp -r /Users/maximgekk/proj/add-partition-refresh-cache-2/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0 /Users/maximgekk/proj/add-partition-refresh-cache-2/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=1\r\n```\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part=1) location '/Users/maximgekk/proj/add-partition-refresh-cache-2/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=1';\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last query must return `0\t1` since it has been added by `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes for the example above:\r\n```sql\r\n...\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part=1) location '/Users/maximgekk/proj/add-partition-refresh-cache-2/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=1';\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n0\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #31081 to branch-3.1.\r\n\r\nThis changes `ReplaceTableExec`/`AtomicReplaceTableExec`, and uncaches the target table before it is dropped. In addition, this includes some refactoring by moving the `uncacheTable` method to `DataSourceV2Strategy` so that we don't need to pass a Spark session to the v2 exec.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSimilar to SPARK-33492 (#30429). When a table is refreshed, the associated cache should be invalidated to avoid potential incorrect results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Now When a data source v2 is cached (either directly or indirectly), all the relevant caches will be refreshed or invalidated if the table is replaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit

The example below portraits the problem:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl2 (col int, part int) partitioned by (part);\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl2 partition (part=1) select 1;\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl2 partition (part=0) select 0;\r\nspark-sql> show table extended like 'tbl2' partition (part = 0);\r\ndefault\ttbl2\tfalse\tPartition Values: [part=0]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/apache-spark/spark-warehouse/tbl2/part=0\r\n...\r\n```\r\nRemove the partition (part = 0) from the filesystem:\r\n```\r\n$ rm -rf /Users/maximgekk/proj/apache-spark/spark-warehouse/tbl2/part=0\r\n```\r\nEven after recovering, we cannot query the table:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl2 recover partitions;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl2;\r\n21/01/08 22:49:13 ERROR SparkSQLDriver: Failed in [select * from tbl2]\r\norg.apache.hadoop.mapred.InvalidInputException: Input path does not exist: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/apache-spark/spark-warehouse/tbl2/part=0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, we can query recovered table:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl2 recover partitions;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl2;\r\n1\t1\r\nspark-sql> show partitions tbl2;\r\npart=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *CatalogedDDLSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-01-08T20:12:00Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T21:45:33Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T21:45:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1a534af7498a75910feff4ac18d31dd0a8f6382c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31097/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31097/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31097/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/962ed6b67b5438515b34b7711ed1ae10d9ad1dbe","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:add-partition-refresh-cache","ref":"add-partition-refresh-cache","sha":"962ed6b67b5438515b34b7711ed1ae10d9ad1dbe","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a feature which supports 32-bit unicode escape in string literals like PostgreSQL or some modern programming languages do (e.g, Python3, C++11 and Rust).\r\nIn addition to the feature which supports 16-bit unicode escape like `\"\\u0041\"`, users can express unicode characters like `\"\\U00020BB7\"` with this change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUsers can express unicode characters straightly without surrogate pair.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users an express all the unicode characters straightly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Recognize `null` while parsing partition specs, and put `null` instead of `\"null\"` as partition values.\r\n2. For V1 catalog: replace `null` by `__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, `null` in partition specs is recognized as the `\"null\"` string which could lead to incorrect results, for example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl5 (col1 INT, p1 STRING) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (p1);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO TABLE tbl5 PARTITION (p1 = null) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT isnull(p1) FROM tbl5;\r\nfalse\r\n```\r\nEven we inserted a row to the partition with the `null` value, **the resulted table doesn't contain `null`**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above works as expected:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT isnull(p1) FROM tbl5;\r\ntrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *SQLQuerySuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *CatalogedDDLSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Recognize `null` while parsing partition specs, and put `null` instead of `\"null\"` as partition values.\r\n2. For V1 catalog: replace `null` by `__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__`.\r\n3. For V2 catalogs: pass `null` AS IS, and let catalog implementations to decide how to handle `null`s as partition values in spec.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, `null` in partition specs is recognized as the `\"null\"` string which could lead to incorrect results, for example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl5 (col1 INT, p1 STRING) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (p1);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO TABLE tbl5 PARTITION (p1 = null) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT isnull(p1) FROM tbl5;\r\nfalse\r\n```\r\nEven we inserted a row to the partition with the `null` value, **the resulted table doesn't contain `null`**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above works as expected:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT isnull(p1) FROM tbl5;\r\ntrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites `SQLQuerySuite`, `AlterTablePartitionV2SQLSuite` and `v1/ShowPartitionsSuite`.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan <wenchen@databricks.com>\r\n(cherry

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR tweaks the width of left-menu of Spark SQL Guide.\r\nWhen I view the Spark SQL Guide with browsers on macOS, the title `Spark SQL Guide` looks prettily.\r\nBut I often use Pop!_OS, an Ubuntu variant, and the title is overlapped with browsers on it.\r\n![spark-sql-guide-layout-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/104002743-d56cc200-51e4-11eb-9e3a-28abcd46e0bf.png)\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the title is no longer overlapped.\r\n![spark-sql-guide-layout-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/104002847-f9c89e80-51e4-11eb-85c0-01d69cee46b7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor the pretty layout.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nBuilt the document with `cd docs && SKIP_API=1 jekyll build` and confirmed the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a few description to SS doc about offset reset and data loss.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDuring recent SS test, the behavior of gradual reducing input rows are confusing me. Comparing with Flink, I do not see a similar behavior. After looking into the code and doing some tests, I feel it is better to add some more description there in SS doc.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, doc only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDoc

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an incorrect unicode literal test in `ParserUtilsSuite`.\r\nIn that suite, string literals in queries have unicode escape characters like `\\u7328` but the backslash should be escaped because \r\nthe queriy strings are given as Java strings.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCorrect the test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nRun `ParserUtilsSuite` and it

PR is the same as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30998 to merge to branch 3.0\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.getFinalPhysicalPlan, when newStages are generated, sort the new stages by class type to make sure BroadcastQueryState precede others.\r\nIt can make sure the broadcast job are submitted before map jobs to avoid waiting for job schedule and cause broadcast timeout. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen enable AQE, in getFinalPhysicalPlan, spark traversal the physical plan bottom up and create query stage for materialized part by createQueryStages and materialize those new created query stages to submit map stages or broadcasting. When ShuffleQueryStage are materializing before BroadcastQueryStage, the map job and broadcast job are submitted almost at the same time, but map job will hold all the computing resources. If the map job runs slow (when lots of data needs to process and the resource is limited), the broadcast job cannot be started(and finished) before spark.sql.broadcastTimeout, thus cause whole job failed (introduced in SPARK-31475).\r\nThe workaround to increase spark.sql.broadcastTimeout doesn't make sense and graceful, because the data to broadcast is very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Add UT\r\n2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis changes `ReplaceTableExec`/`AtomicReplaceTableExec`, and uncaches the target table before it is dropped. In addition, this includes some refactoring by moving the `uncacheTable` method to `DataSourceV2Strategy` so that we don't need to pass a Spark session to the v2 exec.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSimilar to SPARK-33492 (#30429). When a table is refreshed, the associated cache should be invalidated to avoid potential incorrect results.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Now When a data source v2 is cached (either directly or indirectly), all the relevant caches will be refreshed or invalidated if the table is replaced.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe meet some ploblem when backport SPARK-33806. It is because the UnresolvedFunction.foldable will throw a exception. It's ok with master branch, but it's better to do it at Optimizer. Some reason:\r\n\r\n1. It's not always safe to call Expression.foldable before analysis.\r\n2. fold num partition to 1 more like a optimize behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pull request exposes the `make_interval` function, [as suggested here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31000#pullrequestreview-560812433), and as agreed to [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31000#issuecomment-754856820) and [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31000#issuecomment-755040234).\r\n\r\nThis powerful little function allows for idiomatic datetime arithmetic via the Scala API:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// add two hours\r\ndf.withColumn(\"plus_2_hours\", col(\"first_datetime\") + make_interval(hours = lit(2)))\r\n\r\n// subtract one week and 30 seconds\r\ncol(\"d\") - make_interval(weeks = lit(1), secs = lit(30))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `make_interval` [SQL function](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26446) already exists.\r\n\r\nHere is [the JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33995) for this PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe Spark API makes it easy to perform datetime addition / subtraction with months (`add_months`) and days (`date_add`).  Users need to write code like this to perform datetime addition with years, weeks, hours, minutes, or seconds:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.withColumn(\"plus_2_hours\", expr(\"first_datetime + INTERVAL 2 hours\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe don't want to force users to manipulate SQL strings when they're using the Scala API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR adds `make_interval` to the `org.apache.spark.sql.functions` API.  \r\n\r\nThis single function will benefit a lot of users.  It's a small increase in the surface of the API for a big gain.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested via unit tests.\r\n\r\ncc: @MaxGekk

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nKafka delegation token is obtained with `AdminClient` where security settings can be set. Keystore and trustrore type however can't be set. In this PR I've added these new configurations. This can be useful when the type is different. A good example is to make Spark FIPS compliant where the default JKS is not accepted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMissing configurations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, adding 2 additional config parameters.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + modified unit tests + simple Kafka to Kafka app on cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-06T17:51:14Z","updated_at":"2021-01-08T16:47:58Z","closed_at":"2021-01-08T11:05:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d1eaf1b27a00a0e055ad35bb16b4e546b6e0faa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31070/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31070/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31070/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9f2cacbac8a2d783003f9a2b57efe93b46cc7ffb","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-34032","ref":"SPARK-34032","sha":"9f2cacbac8a2d783003f9a2b57efe93b46cc7ffb","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

NoSuchPermanentFunctionException => failFunctionLookup(name)` is `unreachable code`.\r\n\r\nThis pr remove `case _: NoSuchPermanentFunctionException => failFunctionLookup(name)` directly because both these 2 branches handle exceptions in the same way: `failFunctionLookup(name)`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCleanup \"unreachable code\" compilation warnings.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27406. It fixes the naming to match with Scala side.\r\n\r\nNote that there are a bit of inconsistency already e.g.) `col`, `e`, `expr` and `column`. This part I did not change but other names like `zero` vs `initialValue` or `col1`/`col2` vs `left`/`right` looks unnecessary.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the usage similar with Scala side, and for consistency.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions and Jenkins build will test it out.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-06T08:28:07Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:55:18Z","closed_at":"2021-01-06T09:46:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a4ed9a152026b82853a9ad9a413ec0fb0e432a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e1a2cdada8aa04de6a9a1a57ffce11d226db1155","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-30681","ref":"SPARK-30681","sha":"e1a2cdada8aa04de6a9a1a57ffce11d226db1155","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Invoke `refreshTable()` from `AlterTableRenamePartitionCommand.run()` after partitions renaming. In particular, this re-creates the cache associated with the modified table.\r\n2. Refresh the cache associated with tables from v2 table catalogs in the `ALTER TABLE .. RENAME TO PARTITION` command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issues portrayed by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (col0 int, part0 int) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (part0);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION (part0=0) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION (part0=1) SELECT 1;\r\nspark-sql> CACHE TABLE tbl1;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n0\t0\r\n1\t1\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl1 PARTITION (part0=0) RENAME TO PARTITION (part=2);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n0\t0\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\nThe last query must not return `0\t2` since `0  0` was renamed by previous command.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes for the example above:\r\n```sql\r\n...\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl1 PARTITION (part=0) RENAME TO PARTITION (part=2);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n0\t2\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

is a backport of #30954\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFilter out the driver entity when updating the exclusion status of live executors(including the driver), so the driver won't be marked as blacklisted in the UI even if the node that hosts the driver has been marked as blacklisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore this change, if we run spark with the standalone mode and with spark.blacklist.enabled=true. The driver will be marked as blacklisted when the host that hosts that driver has been marked as blacklisted. While it's incorrect because the exclude list feature will exclude executors only and the driver is still active.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26694233/103732959-3494c180-4fae-11eb-9da0-2c906309ea83.png)\r\nAfter the fix, the driver won't be marked as blacklisted.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26694233/103732974-3fe7ed00-4fae-11eb-90d1-7ee44d4ed7c9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to adjust the order of check in KafkaTokenUtil.needTokenUpdate, so that short-circuit applies on the non-delegation token cases (insecure + secured without delegation token) and remedies the performance regression heavily.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere's a serious performance regression between Spark 2.4 vs Spark 3.0 on read path against Kafka data source.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually ran a reproducer (https://github.com/codegorillauk/spark-kafka-read with modification to just count instead of writing to Kafka topic) with measuring the time.\r\n\r\n> the branch applying the change with adding measurement\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark/commits/debug-SPARK-33635-v3.0.1\r\n\r\n> the branch only adding

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure that `SharedState` would be only initiated once across SparkSessions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis helps us to fix the listener(e.g., SQLAppStatusListener) leak issue, and allow SparkSessions created by `getOrCreate` to share the `CacheManager`,  global temp view, etc.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded
