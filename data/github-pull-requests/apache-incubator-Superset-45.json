Contours are defined as either `Isolines` or `Isobands` (more information [here](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/aggregation-layers/contour-layer)). \r\n- `Isolines` require three fields, `threshold`, `color`, `strokeWidth`. `threshold` defines a value to separate aggregated values on the Map. `strokeWidth` defines the width of the line in pixels that separates these values. `color` is just the color of that line.\r\n- `Isobands` are similar to `Isolines`, except the `threshold` takes 2 values to create polygons on the map instead of lines.\r\n\r\nTo account for this unique structure, I added a new control panel input component: \r\n![Screenshot 2023-05-20 at 11 38 33 PM](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/36670322/0876a86d-f7f8-4925-a8aa-4889745be575)\r\nThe added files for this input component are located under `superset-frontend/src/explore/components/controls/ContourControl/`:\r\n\r\n- `types.ts` contains all the types needed for this new component.\r\n- `index.tsx` controls the stateful variables that control adding/editing/removing contours.\r\n- `ContourOption.tsx` displays added contours and an appropriate tooltip.\r\n- `ContourPopoverControl.tsx` defines a popup with appropriate inputs for creating/editing an `isoline` and `isoband`.\r\n- `ContourPopoverTrigger.tsx` wraps the `ContourPopoverControl` and controls when it is displayed.\r\n\r\nThe Back End code for this feature follows the back end code for other deck.gl visualizations as well, providing functions to structure queried data for the Heatmap component.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nNew Visualization Recording:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/36670322/6b8da315-23e7-4ed9-a0ce-f0905815a405\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Changing order of contours</summary>\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/36670322/118b97f3-7334-4041-9392-5f5171a57996\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n_**Set up**_\r\n1. Start Superset\r\n2. Click on the `Charts` tab at the top of the screen\r\n3. Click the `+ Chart` button at the top right\r\n4. Load a dataset with geo-positional data (longitude/latitude)\r\n5. Search the charts for `Deck.gl Contour` or click on the `Map` chart category\r\n6. Select `deck.gl Contour` and hit `Create New Chart`\r\n7. Update the `Longitude & Latitude` field to the correct columns\r\n8. Select a `Weight` function\r\n9. Select `Create Chart`\r\n10. There should now be a contour layer present on the screen\r\n    - Note: the underlying map component may not be visible if the MAP_BOX_API_KEY is not set. To set it follow the instructions [here](https://superset.apache.org/docs/frequently-asked-questions/#why-is-the-map-not-visible-in-the-geospatial-visualization)\r\n    - Note: It may look like the contour layer is not working if the `Cell Size` parameter is not large enough. For example, using the `flights` dataset, you should increase `Cell Size` to 50000.\r\n\r\nCheck that the following cause an immediate update\r\n- Check that increasing/decreasing the `Cell Size` control \r\n- Try adding a new isoline by clicking `Click to add new contour`\r\n- Try adding a new isoband by clicking `Click to add new contour`\r\n- Try clicking an existing contour option and ensure that a popover appears with the appropriate fields pre-filled\r\n- Delet an existing contour option\r\n\r\nOther Checks:\r\n- Check that hovering a contour option and check that the tooltip shows appropriate information\r\n- Check that in the contour popover, the submit button is disabled when:\r\n    - Not all fields are filled\r\n    - All fields are filled, but a non-integer is entered in any of the textfields\r\n- Check all descriptions make sense\r\n- Check that changing the order of contours (by drag and drop) updates their z-index.\r\n   - If there are overlapping contours, contours at the top of the list may be hidden by contours beneath them.\r\n   - _Note: z-fighting may occur depending on how many contours are defined/how many are displayed. However this is an issue with the library itself._\r\n \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR bumps to postgresql:15 image version in Dockerfile and GH workflows.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPostgres 15.0 change log: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/15.0/\r\n\r\nFrom Postgres release [news](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-15-released-2526/): \r\n> In this latest release, PostgreSQL improves on its in-memory and on-disk [sorting](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/queries-order.html) algorithms, with benchmarks showing speedups of 25% - 400% based on which data types are sorted. Using row_number(), rank(), dense_rank(), and count() as [window functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/functions-window.html) also have performance benefits in PostgreSQL 15. Queries using [SELECT DISTINCT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/queries-select-lists.html#QUERIES-DISTINCT) can now be [executed in parallel](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/parallel-query.html).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Note**: The Helm Chart already uses PostgreSQL 15 as introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22590.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThere's a rendering perf regression from #22084\r\n\r\nWhen SelectAll feature introduced by

This makes the performance degraded for the large size options.\r\n```\r\noptions | Select options. Will get better perf than jsx definition\r\n-- | --\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit recovers the way to use options prop as before (including SelectAll condition)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\r\n#23339 introduced the possibility of normalizing non-UTC timestamps so that they produced correctly formatted timestamps. However, the normalizer wasn't being used in the ECharts plugin, causing string based non-timezone timestamps to display incorrectly when used as a groupby.\r\n\r\nThis adds a call to the `normalizeTimestamp` util in `formatSeriesName` to ensure that string based timestamps are normalized prior to being fed to the timestamp formatter.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the timestamp is formatted correctly:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/eaffc2c4-4dc1-422a-bb0d-967bec06f4d3)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the timestamp was assumed to be in local timezone, causing the formatted timestamp to be offset by the UTC offset (this was run in UTC+0200):\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/8efecd0d-5548-4fa0-91a6-8a1c341d7b7c)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

package (formally `fbprophet`) historically has been \"difficult\" to work with from an installation perspective—atypical requirement definitions (`fbstan` needed to be installed first), no pre-built wheels, etc.—though thankfully in [v1.1](https://github.com/facebook/prophet/releases/tag/v1.1) there are pre-built binaries for MacOS, Windows, and Linux.\r\n\r\nThis PR bumps the version of the package and defines it as a requirement for the `testing` environment removing the need for the `pytest.importorskip(\"prophet\")`—likely present due to problematic build. This ensures that the associated tests will now always run.\r\n\r\nThe frozen requirements were updated by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip-compile-multi --no-upgrade\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to the work done in #23777, more specifically this discussion: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23777#discussion_r1174893780\r\n\r\nCurrently Row Level Security has a dedicated set of related base filters that makes it possible to customize the filters that are applied on the Table and Role models. These are defined on the `RLS_BASE_RELATED_FIELD_FILTERS` config parameter.\r\n\r\nHaving these undefined by default is counter intuitive, as it means that a user that is given RLS access will be able to see ALL datasets under the RLS table dropdown, irrespective of which tables they see under the Datasets menu. To streamline this we should just use the same base filter we use for the dataset list view (`DatasourceFilter`).\r\n\r\nFor roles, the PR #22526 introduced the possibility to define a base filter for Roles. To avoid having duplicated logic and to give the users a unified UX, we can reuse the Role filter that users can define via the `EXTRA_RELATED_QUERY_FILTERS` config flag.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\n\r\nThis is the datasets view for a user that is only able to access two datasets on the instance (the Gamma user only has database access to the BurgerKing database, despite there being many other databases/datasets on the instance).\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/b2dfc894-a7bc-4854-ba2c-56ae80c3ce56)\r\n\r\nWith the `DASHBOARD_RBAC` feature enabled and a custom Roles filter, the user was only able to see the `Team-BurgerKing` role:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/26a90104-2354-4597-97aa-8a8a4b833c12)\r\n\r\nPreviously, the same user would see all tables and roles on the instance if they had RLS perms. After this change the RLS dropdowns are aligned with what's available elsewhere:\r\n\r\nRLS tables:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/9d33ad4a-5836-4d93-94e7-a06af96521c7)\r\n\r\nRLS roles:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/ffc96f1d-cba1-4fd1-9b18-2d17f2e5376e)\r\n\r\nAs a bycatch, the \"Roles\" title is also changed to \"Excluded roles\" if the filter type is set to \"Base\" (this is similar to how the list view):\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/7ec6b89c-0da1-4ac2-bf07-1b1d97064721)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23890 (thanks to @sebastianliebscher) we dropped support for Python 3.8 and thus now we are free to embrace the walrus (`:=`) operator. This PR adds a pre-commit hook (which runs before `black`) to ensure we never have code of the form, \r\n\r\n```python\r\n n = 10\r\n if n > 3:\r\n     print(n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut rather,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif (n := 10) > 3:\r\n    print(n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the pre-commit hook only detects/remedies simple use cases. Personally I've found the walrus operator really handy in list comprehensions (when you need to assign a temporary variable) and logic like, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfoo = bar()\r\nreturn foo.value if foo else None\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich becomes, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nreturn foo.value if (foo := bar()) else None\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/23176 was designed to handle URLs with a `@` symbol, but does not work for passwords with`%` signs. The root cause is clearly documented [here](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/api/config.html#alembic.config.Config.set_main_option), in that `set_main_option` requires escaping of `%` characters. \r\n\r\nJust setting the escaped password as the secret value does not work, as that value is used correctly elsewhere for db connections (with correct escape character handling), so in those instances you get password errors due to the extra character.","created_at":"2023-05-18T22:39:07Z","updated_at":"2023-05-18T22:46:48Z","closed_at":"2023-05-18T22:39:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f985e6f1e272556d4c4f2be22f2c6524f85c2783","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[{"name":"superset

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24068 I merged a change which bumped the `basepython` in the `tox.ini` whilst testing locally.

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22853#discussion_r1198093934, this PR addresses an issue introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22853 where chart exploration from SQL Lab would instantiate `TableColumn` objects however there was no `SqlaTable` associated with said columns, which previously was a necessary requirement.\r\n\r\nThis PR augments the `TableColumn` class to include a `Database` object which is external to the ORM. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI and added some basic unit/integration tests.\r\n\r\nNote there is very little unit/integration tests for this work beyond broad workflows. If people are accepting of this approach, I'll strive to add tests before merging, but I first thought there was merit to presenting  this approach as a solution.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhilst debugging an issue I came across a frequently repeated pattern:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif exceptions:\r\n    exception = AnnotationInvalidError()\r\n    exception.add_list(exceptions)\r\n    raise exception\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese exceptions are derived from the `CommandInvalidError` class which included the `add` and `add_list` methods and had no way of adding the exceptions when constructing the error.  To adhere to the DRY principle this PR performs the following:\r\n\r\n1. Renames `add` to `append`—akin to `list.append`.\r\n2. Renames `add_list` to `extend`—akin to `list.extend`.\r\n3. Add the ability to specify the exceptions in the `__init__` method.\r\n\r\nwhere the later means that the snippet of code above reduces to,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif exceptions:\r\n    raise AnnotationInvalidError(exceptions=exceptions)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nRecently, a PR changed the endpoint used to update datasets to `PUT /api/v1/dataset/{id}`: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23678\r\n\r\nThe old endpoint did not have a lot of the validation the new endpoint had.  As a result, some existing datasets would then fail validation once we switched over to the stricter one, making them unable to be updated unless you knew exactly what to change.  It was also discovered that the custom validation for a column's `python_date_format` did not allow slashes in the date format, only hyphens, which was confusing since the UI placeholder uses slashes.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the validation to allow for either slashes or hyphens and makes a few other tweaks to reduce false-alarm validation errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nPreviously, when user applied drill by on a series of temporal dimension, the related adhoc filter would be a simple equality comparison to a timestamp. Now, we create a proper temporal range filter based on timestamp and chosen granularity.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/47d4a92e-54e6-4ec3-83ae-cc07dacc656f\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/31150ecd-de3e-4c21-9742-fc22febbf8aa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `DRILL_BY` feature flag\r\n2. Add some charts with temporal dimensions to the dashboard\r\n3. Drill by on a temporal series\r\n4. Verify (either by checking the request payload or opening explore) that related adhoc filter is a temporal range filter\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis was our slowest Cypress test, and was running 1-2 minutes per test run. Bard says this'll be faster. Here's its explanation of all this:\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few things you can do to optimize the test `should show the cross-referenced dashboards`.\r\n\r\nFirst, you can use the` cy.fixture()` function to cache the results of the `createSampleDashboards()` and `createSampleCharts()` calls. This will prevent Cypress from having to make these calls every time the test runs, which will improve performance.\r\n\r\nSecond, you can use the `cy.only()` function to only run the `saveAndVerifyDashboard()` calls for the first 10 dashboards. This will reduce the overall time it takes to run the test.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can use the `cy.parallel()` function to run the `verifyDashboardSearch()` and `verifyDashboardLink()` calls in parallel. This will allow Cypress to run these calls simultaneously, which will improve performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nDoesn't fix the issue, however updates the docs for: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/23957\r\n\r\nAdvising that users lock to the PyAthena version release before the recent [v3.0.0 release](https://github.com/laughingman7743/PyAthena/releases/tag/v3.0.0) as the current recommended command now installs version 3.0.x which is causing errors\r\n\r\nWhen using version <=2.x.x, errors do not occur - It appears as though there have been significant changes made to the PyAthena library.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nWhen using version >=3.0.x of the driver, existing datasets cannot be edited, added and dashboards and charts can no longer be viewed.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n2023-05-17 23:26:07 2023-05-17 15:26:07,321:ERROR:superset.views.base:name 'Union' is not

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, when the modal window opens, the \"owners\" field is left unpopulated. This is slightly annoying as it would be more user friendly and efficient to automatically pre-populate the field with the currently logged-in user.\r\n\r\nTo address this, I propose retrieving the current user from Redux state and setting it as the default owner when the alert modal is opened.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1166\"

minimal requirement for the `python-trino-client` as, per the [0.324.0](https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client/blob/master/CHANGES.md#release-03240) release notes, the latest release includes a vital fix to address an IANA time zone issue.\r\n\r\nNote as part of this change I rebuilt the frozen requirements via:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements/integration.txt\r\n> pip-compile-multi --no-upgrade\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich, in addition to bumping the `trino` package, removed some legacy requirement which likely were removed in previous PRs without refreezing the requirements.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20938 however it didn't surface until https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22853 which resulted in a somewhat bad correctness regression as the resulting generated SQL was incorrect when filtering the temporal column, i.e., rather than queries being generated of the form,\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWHERE\r\n    ds >= '2023-01-01'\r\n```\r\n\r\nthey were being generated as:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWHERE\r\n    ds >= '2023-01-01 00:00:00.000000'\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich due to lexicographical ordering would wrongfully exclude any records where `ds` = `2023-01-01`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe TL;DR is https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20938 replicated logic from the  `TableColumn` class however it did not include the logic which adhered to the Python date/time format meaning that columns which weren't handled by the DB engine spec `convert_dttm` method were cast to an ISO 8601 formatted string adhering to the `Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f` format.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the missing logic and removes the now unused (per https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22853) `TableColumn` methods to help improve the code hygiene and readability—having two or more instances of the same function makes the code very difficult to grok. @hughhhh I would suggest you perform a second pass to make sure all the legacy logic which was ported to the `ExploreMixin` has been removed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nAdded unit

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR does two things.\r\n\r\n1. Replaces a variable EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS with the variable that superseded it, `ALERT_REPORTS_NOTIFICATION_DRY_RUN`.\r\n2. Remove `ALERT_REPORTS_NOTIFICATION_DRY_RUN = True` from superset_config.py so that the value of `False` in config.py is the default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nThis *might* be considered a breaking change if a Superset instance was configured with the same value for `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` and `ALERT_REPORTS_NOTIFICATION_DRY_RUN`, i.e., that dry run is being set to both True and False.  One variable acts in core.py, the other in execute.py, and I'm not sure what happens if they conflict - maybe there's a chance that this could disable dry run mode ?  This feels unlikely and low-risk to me but if so, should be a candidate for 3.0.0

SUMMARY\r\nWhile the `QueryObjectFilterClause` currently supports passing a `grain` (see here: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/7fe0ca12c0ae24c9b2546118e9ebdb94a9e3a22d/superset/utils/core.py#L223-L228), it was not used in the construction of the actual WHERE clause. This adds support for adding a time grain to temporal filters, making it possible to filter by full time periods. For example, the date `2000-01-01` (Saturday) becomes `1999-12-26` (the previous Monday) with weekly timegrain. Without applying the time grain to the temporal range, the observation for the first week in the query will only consist of two days (Saturday and Sunday), which can give the impression that the events for Monday-Friday never took place.\r\n\r\nWhile writing the test I noticed we had many redundant split strings (they were likely split before due to line width, but were moved on the same line by black). So I cleaned up the ones I found under `db_engine_specs`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe function `has_table_query` is used to detect if a given query is selecting from one or more tables, in order to prevent malicious ad-hoc expressions that bypass RLS. Because `sqlparse` is non-validating the function needs to keep track of a lot of state, and often fails on edge cases.\r\n\r\nThis PR rewrites the function to use `sqloxide`. The advantage is that the function is now more robust, supporting custom dialects and handling more edge cases. There are a couple disadvantages, though:\r\n\r\n- `sqloxide` was an optional dependency, with this PR it becomes mandatory.\r\n- The function `has_table_query` now requires a full SQL query, so for validating expressions they need to be wrapped in `f\"SELECT {expression}\"`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nThe unit tests pass mostly unmodified, the only exception is that `table` is usually a reserved keyword and had to be quoted in order to `sqloxide` to parse it (`sqlparse` is much more lenient). I added a new test to cover another edge case that was found could bypass RLS.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\nWe want to use Python 3.11 in the docker image to benefit from its performance improvements. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nRun the docker build and see if it works with Python 3.11\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backward-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\nI am not changing the default image version which is using PY 3.9. I just added the ability to create additional images with 3.11 so that we can use it with Superset's code base.\r\nTalking of database drivers, Many of the drivers we use, do support Py 3.11. For e.g. pyathena, redshift-connector, pyscopg2, and many

SUMMARY\r\nAdd cross-filter scoping feature (previously removed in PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23216).\r\n\r\nIn order to set cross filter scoping, user can open the scoping modal either from the configuration menu in upper left corner of the dashboard or from a options menu of any chart that's compatible with cross filters.\r\n\r\nUser can set a global scoping which will be a default scoping for every chart that supports cross filters. The global scoping can be overriden for each chart individually.\r\n\r\nIf a custom scoping for a chart is removed, the chart reverts to using the global scoping\r\n\r\nPlease take note that cross filter will NOT be applied to charts that have datasources incompatible with the emitter chart (target chart uses a different datasource which does not share a common column name with the emitter chart), even if they are in scope of the emitter chart!\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/799fd7ed-e9ec-4de5-bf63-598e33c57097\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `DASHBOARD_CROSS_FILTERS` feature flag\r\n2. Set global and custom scopings by entering the scoping modal from chart's options menu or from filter's config menu in the upper left corner\r\n3. Apply some cross filterings, verify that they match the scoping set for the source chart\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\n`antd`'s slider, as used in dashboard filters, has a step size of 1 (`antd`'s default). So when the entire range of numbers is within 1, the slider is inoperable.\r\n\r\nA few possible solutions -- I chose option (3):\r\n\r\n1. Set the step size to something static that fixes this particular issue, like .01.  This makes things better for this case, but worse for cases where a step size of `1` is sufficient.\r\n2. Let the user choose a step size in the filter setup dialog.  Nice because it makes things explicit, but adds extra UI stuff and users have to make extra decisions.\r\n3. Come up with a heuristic for choosing a step size.  Nice because it works by default, and without any extra work from the user.  If we want the user to be able to choose their own step size, that could be a feature rather than a bug fix (and seems to be in-progress [over here](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/18009\r\n))\r\n\r\nThis solution preserves the default behavior where the rightmost digit moves up and down by 1, while accounting for the cases where that 1 ought to be after the decimal point. The calculated step-size is the largest such number (but not larger than `1`) that accommodates the minimum number of steps we'd want to have (`MIN_NUM_STEPS`)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/99757211/1f513f77-2c30-4c64-baff-088d3fcc236b\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/99757211/72188e8b-0e76-4a23-ab5b-d9709072532a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n#### How to reproduce the bug\r\n\r\n1. Create a chart using a dataset that has a column whose values are within a range of `1`.   E.g. a column all of whose values are between 0 and 1.\r\n1a. If you don't have such a dataset, edit a dataset using \"calculated columns\" to create one.\r\n2. Create a dashboard that uses that chart.\r\n3. Add a numerical range filter to that dashboard, connected to the column in step (1).\r\n5. Try to use the slider\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\nFixes #24010\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x]

Superset 3.0 task [#11](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/201/views/1?filterQuery=druid&pane=issue&itemId=18491735) by removing the remaining legacy Druid NoSQL logic which was removed in Superset 2.0. Specifically it primarily removes form-data keys including:\r\n\r\n- `druid_time_origin`\r\n- `having_druid`\r\n- `having_filters`*\r\n- `granularity`**\r\n\r\n\\* This represents SIMPLE, i.e., non-SQL, having filters which were only supported with the Druid NoSQL connector.\r\n\r\n\\** This term is used inappropriately and represents either the Druid NoSQL time granularity or the SQL time column (an alias for `granularity_sqla` used in the query context and frontend). Differentiating between the two is somewhat of a challenge.\r\n\r\nNote this PR leaves the `Slice.datasource_type` column (and associated logic) as is—which was primarily used to differentiate between the SQL and Druid NoSQL connectors—as it isn't officially deprecated and maybe used to currently (or in the future) for ad-hoc query based datasets (or similar).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR
