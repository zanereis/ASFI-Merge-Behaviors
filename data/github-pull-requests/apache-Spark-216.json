What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix the `InSet.sql` method for the cases when input collection contains values of internal Catalyst's types, for instance `UTF8String`. Elements of the input set `hset` are converted to Scala types, and wrapped by `Literal` to properly form SQL view of the input collection.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fixed the bug in `InSet.sql` that makes wrong assumption about types of collection elements. See more details in SPARK-31563.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nHighly likely, not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test to

The handling of the config is different between branch-3.0+ and branch-2.4. In branch-3.0+, Spark always lowercases a value in the config, so I think we had better always use lowercases for it in the test.\r\n\r\nThis comes from the @dongjoon-hyun \r\n comment: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28316#issuecomment-619303160\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR intends to fix test code for using lowercases for the `GLOBAL_TEMP_DATABASE` config in `SparkSessionBuilderSuite`. The handling of the config is different between branch-3.0+ and branch-2.4. In branch-3.0+, Spark always lowercases a value in the config, so I think we had better always use lowercases for it in the test.\r\n\r\nThis comes from the @dongjoon-hyun \r\n comment: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28316#issuecomment-619303160\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix the test failure in branch-2.4.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch re-obtain tokens at the start of AM for yarn cluster mode, if principal and keytab are available. It basically transfers the credentials from the original user, so this patch puts the new tokens into credentials from the original user via overwriting.\r\n\r\nTo obtain tokens from providers in user application, this patch leverages the user classloader as context classloader while initializing token manager in the startup of AM.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSubmitter will obtain delegation tokens for yarn-cluster mode, and add these credentials to the launch context. AM will be launched with these credentials, and AM and driver are able to leverage these tokens.\r\n\r\nIn Yarn cluster mode, driver is launched in AM, which in turn initializes token manager (while initializing SparkContext) and obtain delegation tokens (+ schedule to renew) if both principal and keytab are available.\r\n\r\nThat said, even we provide principal and keytab to run application with yarn-cluster mode, AM always starts with initial tokens from launch context until token manager runs and obtains delegation tokens.\r\n\r\nSo there's a \"gap\", and if user codes (driver) access to external system with delegation tokens (e.g. HDFS) before initializing SparkContext, it cannot leverage the tokens token manager will obtain. It will make the application fail if AM is killed \"after\" the initial tokens are expired and relaunched.\r\n\r\nThis is even a regression: see below codes in branch-2.4:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.4/resource-managers/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/ApplicationMaster.scala\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.4/resource-managers/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/security/AMCredentialRenewer.scala\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.4.x, AM runs AMCredentialRenewer at initialization, and AMCredentialRenew obtains tokens and merge with credentials being provided with launch context of AM. So it guarantees new tokens in driver run.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with specifically crafted application (simple reproducer) - https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark-delegation-token-experiment/blob/master/src/main/scala/net/heartsavior/spark/example/LongRunningAppWithHDFSConfig.scala\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, new AM attempt failed when I killed AM after the expiration of tokens. After this patch the new AM attempt runs fine.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-25T01:32:45Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T00:29:50Z","closed_at":"2020-05-12T00:25:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"18fab800c766f5445eb9758a36cd07ad57aa2662","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28336/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28336/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28336/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ced27e349ff34d5ab2b1dd62c9d6912e239f8c23","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-31559","ref":"SPARK-31559","sha":"ced27e349ff34d5ab2b1dd62c9d6912e239f8c23","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd unit tests to the 'number of output rows metric' for some join types in the SQLMetricSuite. A list of unit tests added are as follows.\r\n- ShuffledHashJoin: leftOuter, RightOuter, LeftAnti, LeftSemi\r\n- BroadcastNestedLoopJoin: RightOuter\r\n- BroadcastHashJoin: LeftAnti\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor some combinations of JoinType and Join algorithm there is no test coverage for the 'number of output rows' metric.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added debug statements in the code to ensure the correct combination if JoinType and Join algorithms are triggered.\r\nI further used Intellij debugger to test the same.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-24T19:40:48Z","updated_at":"2020-05-25T03:45:08Z","closed_at":"2020-05-25T03:44:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1dc403f93e0491753d0772997240b04be7a3c2da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/830dfbf7d5b612a1cdb61854419ddadad4829c31","head":{"label":"sririshindra:SPARK-31377","ref":"SPARK-31377","sha":"830dfbf7d5b612a1cdb61854419ddadad4829c31","user":{"login":"sririshindra","id":9795421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra","html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":245021426,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDUwMjE0MjY=","name":"spark","full_name":"sririshindra/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sririshindra","id":9795421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra","html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sririshindra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sririshindra/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `InSet` expression expects input collections of internal Catalyst types, for example `hset` must contain elements of `UTF8String` for `child` of string type. So, it means `isInCollection` must convert users values to internal Catalyst values but currently it doesn't perform the conversion. That leads to incorrect results for collection sizes above the threshold `spark.sql.optimizer.inSetConversionThreshold`.\r\n\r\nThe bug was introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25754.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix incorrect behaviour of `isInCollection`. For example, if the SQL config `spark.sql.optimizer.inSetConversionThreshold`is set to 10 (by default):\r\n```scala\r\nval set = (0 to 20).map(_.toString).toSet\r\nval data = Seq(\"1\").toDF(\"x\")\r\ndata.select($\"x\".isInCollection(set).as(\"isInCollection\")).show()\r\n```\r\nThe function must return **'true'** because \"1\" is in the set of \"0\" ... \"20\" but it returns \"false\":\r\n```\r\n+--------------+\r\n|isInCollection|\r\n+--------------+\r\n|         false|\r\n+--------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing test suite `ColumnExpressionSuite`\r\n- Add new test to `ColumnExpressionSuite`\r\n- Manually benchmark it by the code from #25754:\r\n```scala\r\ndef testExplainTime(collectionSize: Int) = {\r\n        val df = spark.range(10).withColumn(\"id2\", col(\"id\") + 1)\r\n        val list = Range(0, collectionSize).toList\r\n        val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis() \r\n        df.where(col(\"id\").isInCollection(list)).where(col(\"id2\").isInCollection(list)).explain()\r\n        val elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime\r\n        println(s\"cost time: ${elapsedTime}ms\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen test on collection size 5, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, test result is:\r\n\r\ncollection size | explain time (before) | explain time (after) | w/o optimization\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\n5 | 64ms | 65ms | 62ms\r\n10 | 68ms | 64ms | 88ms\r\n100 | 41ms | 162ms | 227ms\r\n1000 | 98ms | 406ms | 652ms\r\n10000 | 654ms | 2579ms | 4504ms\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-24T12:09:55Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:48:21Z","closed_at":"2020-04-28T14:10:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"009ec4fafe098f8af5bdba94b2acd5a89e9ee9c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28328/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28328/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28328/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4bc0e269df9320e9bb9244afb58b6d1fbbf0e95e","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-isInCollection","ref":"fix-isInCollection","sha":"4bc0e269df9320e9bb9244afb58b6d1fbbf0e95e","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

The current metadata handling logic for `as` will lose the watermark metadata\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/590b9a0132b68d9523e663997def957b2e46dfb1/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Column.scala#L1049-L1054\r\n and finally cause the AnalysisException: \r\n```\r\nStream-stream outer join between two streaming DataFrame/Datasets is not supported without a watermark in the join keys, or a watermark on the nullable side and an appropriate range condition\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nBugfix for an alias on time window with watermark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UTs added.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a benchmark suite for nested predicate pushdown with parquet file:\r\n\r\nPerformance comparison: Nested predicate pushdown disabled vs enabled,  with the following queries scenarios:\r\n\r\n1.  When predicate pushed down, parquet reader are able to filter out all the row groups without loading them.\r\n\r\n2. When predicate pushed down, parquet reader only loads one of the row groups.\r\n\r\n3. When predicate pushed down, parquet reader can't filter out any row group in order to see if we introduce too much overhead or not when enabling nested predicate push down. \r\n\r\n### Why are the

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI tested manually.\r\nFirst, I ran a job `sc.parallelize(1 to 10).collect` in Spark Shell then, visited AllJobsPage and JobPage and confirmed tooltip texts.\r\n<img width=\"196\" alt=\"dag-viz-tooltip-fixed\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/80128813-2db95080-85d1-11ea-82f8-90a1f4547f30.png\">\r\n<img

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRemove all the extra whitespaces in the formatted explain.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe number of extra whitespaces of the formatted explain becomes different between master and branch-3.0. This causes a problem that whenever we backport formatted explain related tests from master to branch-3.0, it will fail branch-3.0. Besides, extra whitespaces are always disallowed in Spark. Thus, we should remove them as possible as we can.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, formatted explain is newly added in Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated sql query tests.","created_at":"2020-04-23T10:19:03Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T07:40:42Z","closed_at":"2020-04-27T07:39:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84fff03d84a98b59ba7b6a3e9fb46c0cb98244b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28315/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28315/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28315/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92bedfd031d916a1d84019988a4725c85f643922","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix_extra_spaces","ref":"fix_extra_spaces","sha":"92bedfd031d916a1d84019988a4725c85f643922","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRewrite the periodically check logic of  `abortableRpcFuture` to make sure that barrier task would always return either desired messages or expected exception.\r\n\r\nThis PR also simplify a bit around `AbortableRpcFuture`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the periodically check logic of  `abortableRpcFuture` is done by following:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n...\r\nvar messages: Array[String] = null\r\n\r\nwhile (!abortableRpcFuture.toFuture.isCompleted) {\r\n   messages = ThreadUtils.awaitResult(abortableRpcFuture.toFuture, 1.second)\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\nreturn messages\r\n```\r\nIt's possible that `abortableRpcFuture` complete before next invocation on `messages = ...`. In this case, the task may return null messages or execute successfully while it should throw exception(e.g. `SparkException` from `BarrierCoordinator`).\r\n\r\nAnd here's a flaky test which caused by this bug:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] BarrierTaskContextSuite:\r\n[info] - share messages with allGather() call *** FAILED *** (18 seconds, 705 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Could not recover from a failed barrier ResultStage. Most recent failure reason: Stage failed because barrier task ResultTask(0, 2) finished unsuccessfully.\r\n[info] java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n[info] \tat scala.collection.mutable.ArrayOps$ofRef$.length$extension(ArrayOps.scala:204)\r\n[info] \tat scala.collection.mutable.ArrayOps$ofRef.length(ArrayOps.scala:204)\r\n[info] \tat scala.collection.IndexedSeqOptimized.toList(IndexedSeqOptimized.scala:285)\r\n[info] \tat scala.collection.IndexedSeqOptimized.toList$(IndexedSeqOptimized.scala:284)\r\n[info] \tat scala.collection.mutable.ArrayOps$ofRef.toList(ArrayOps.scala:198)\r\n[info] \tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.BarrierTaskContextSuite.$anonfun$new$4(BarrierTaskContextSuite.scala:68)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test exception can be reproduced by changing the line `messages = ...` to the following:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nmessages = ThreadUtils.awaitResult(abortableRpcFuture.toFuture, 10.micros)\r\nThread.sleep(5000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test and update some unit tests.","created_at":"2020-04-23T08:54:59Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T14:44:09Z","closed_at":"2020-04-23T14:44:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"224fc1f144780ce1184818c0a5aaff5d88a86f4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e1d23c31e0e33f3ab3ad35b8a300b933cf514226","head":{"label":"Ngone51:cherry-pick-31472","ref":"cherry-pick-31472","sha":"e1d23c31e0e33f3ab3ad35b8a300b933cf514226","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHiveClient instance is cross-session, the following configurations which are defined in HiveUtils and used to create it should be considered static:\r\n\r\n1. spark.sql.hive.metastore.version - used to determine the hive version in Spark\r\n2. spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars - hive metastore related jars location which is used by spark to create hive client\r\n3. spark.sql.hive.metastore.sharedPrefixes and spark.sql.hive.metastore.barrierPrefixes -  package names of classes that are shared or separated between SparkContextLoader and hive client class loader\r\n\r\nThose are used only once when creating the hive metastore client. They should be static in SQLConf for retrieving them correctly. We should avoid them being changed by users with SET/RESET command. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of spark.sql.hive.version - the fake of the spark.sql.hive.metastore.version, it is used by jdbc/thrift client for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nbugfix, these configurations should not be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the following set of configs are not allowed to change.\r\n``` \r\nSeq(\"spark.sql.hive.metastore.version \",\r\n      \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars\",\r\n      \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.sharedPrefixes\",\r\n      \"spark.sql.hive.metastore.barrierPrefixes\")\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a new logical node AggregateWithHaving, and the parser should create this plan for HAVING. The analyzer resolves it to Filter(..., Aggregate(...)).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe SQL parser in Spark creates Filter(..., Aggregate(...)) for the HAVING query, and Spark has a special analyzer rule ResolveAggregateFunctions to resolve the aggregate functions and grouping columns in the Filter operator.\r\n\r\nIt works for simple cases in a very tricky way as it relies on rule execution order:\r\n1. Rule ResolveReferences hits the Aggregate operator and resolves attributes inside aggregate functions, but the function itself is still unresolved as it's an UnresolvedFunction. This stops resolving the Filter operator as the child Aggrege operator is still unresolved.\r\n2. Rule ResolveFunctions resolves UnresolvedFunction. This makes the Aggrege operator resolved.\r\n3. Rule ResolveAggregateFunctions resolves the Filter operator if its child is a resolved Aggregate. This rule can correctly resolve the grouping columns.\r\n\r\nIn the example query, I put a CAST, which needs to be resolved by rule ResolveTimeZone, which runs after ResolveAggregateFunctions. This breaks step 3 as the Aggregate operator is unresolved at that time. Then the analyzer starts next round and the Filter operator is resolved by ResolveReferences, which wrongly resolves the grouping columns.\r\n\r\nSee the demo below:\r\n```\r\nSELECT SUM(a) AS b, '2020-01-01' AS fake FROM VALUES (1, 10), (2, 20) AS T(a, b) GROUP BY b HAVING b > 10\r\n```\r\nThe query's result is\r\n```\r\n+---+----------+\r\n|  b|      fake|\r\n+---+----------+\r\n|  2|2020-01-01|\r\n+---+----------+\r\n```\r\nBut if we add CAST, it will return an empty result.\r\n```\r\nSELECT SUM(a) AS b, CAST('2020-01-01' AS DATE) AS fake FROM VALUES (1, 10), (2, 20) AS T(a, b) GROUP BY b HAVING b > 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, bug fix for cast in having aggregate expressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT added.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-22T10:18:36Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T13:30:14Z","closed_at":"2020-04-28T08:11:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07cc0581ab1694740ccb54bc45a0f888cebd032c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28294/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28294/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28294/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/18d857fa993e2acd7abcb837700e6bc4f3511dd5","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-31519","ref":"SPARK-31519","sha":"18d857fa993e2acd7abcb837700e6bc4f3511dd5","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this change, when dynamic allocation is enabled instead of aborting immediately when there is an unschedulable taskset due to blacklisting, pass an event saying `SparkListenerUnschedulableTaskSetAdded` which will be handled by `ExecutorAllocationManager` and request more executors needed to schedule the unschedulable blacklisted tasks. Once the event is sent, we start the abortTimer similar to [SPARK-22148][SPARK-15815] to abort in the case when no new executors launched either due to max executors reached or cluster manager is out of capacity.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is an improvement. In the case when dynamic allocation is enabled, this would request more executors to schedule the unschedulable tasks instead of aborting the stage without even retrying upto spark.task.maxFailures times (in some cases not retrying at all). This is a potential issue with respect to Spark's Fault tolerance.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests both in ExecutorAllocationManagerSuite and TaskSchedulerImplSuite\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-22T00:11:58Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T17:36:42Z","closed_at":"2020-07-23T17:34:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0b174ed31a9d5de0142716c8327ae429167f4e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28287/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28287/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28287/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d6f1e73ae49d9641a8efcb1f5e9016bd378a70c6","head":{"label":"venkata91:SPARK-31418","ref":"SPARK-31418","sha":"d6f1e73ae49d9641a8efcb1f5e9016bd378a70c6","user":{"login":"venkata91","id":8871522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzE1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8871522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91","html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":170915684,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzA5MTU2ODQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"venkata91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"venkata91","id":8871522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzE1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8871522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91","html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR increases the thread safety of the `BytesToBytesMap`:\r\n- It makes the `iterator()` and `destructiveIterator()` methods used their own `Location` object. This used to be shared, and this was causing issues when the map was being iterated over in two threads by two different iterators.\r\n- Removes the `safeIterator()` function. This is not needed anymore.\r\n- Improves the documentation of a couple of methods w.r.t. thread-safety.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is unexpected an iterator shares the object it is returning with all other iterators. This is a violation of the iterator contract, and it causes issues with iterators over a map that are consumed in different threads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2020-04-21T20:01:10Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T07:59:03Z","closed_at":"2020-04-22T01:17:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f146570a5f538ae94e6dd190d2186231a6bb704f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c4d6c7b6575e9ea9a34b56431e4a181ec020e1b8","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-31511","ref":"SPARK-31511","sha":"c4d6c7b6575e9ea9a34b56431e4a181ec020e1b8","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSeems like in certain environment, it requires to set `setwd` as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> library(devtools); devtools::document(pkg=\"./pkg\", roclets=c(\"rd\"))\r\nLoading required package: usethis\r\nError: Could not find package root, is your working directory inside a package?\r\n```\r\n\r\nsee also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52670051/how-to-troubleshoot-error-could-not-find-package-root and https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rdevtools/79jjjdc_wjg\r\n\r\nWe can make up another story too. For example, if you set a specific directory in your `~/.Rprofile`, then R documentation build will fail as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho 'setwd(\"~\")' > ~/.Rprofile\r\nsh R/create-rd.sh\r\n``` \r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing R_SCRIPT_PATH = /usr/local/bin\r\nLoading required package: usethis\r\nError: Can't find './pkg'.\r\nExecution halted\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to set the `setwd` explicitly so it does not get affected on the global environment.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make R dev env more independent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\necho 'setwd(\"~\")' > ~/.Rprofile\r\nsh R/create-rd.sh\r\n``` \r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing R_SCRIPT_PATH = /usr/local/bin\r\nLoading required package: usethis\r\nError: Can't find './pkg'.\r\nExecution halted\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing R_SCRIPT_PATH = /usr/local/bin\r\nLoading required package: usethis\r\nUpdating SparkR documentation\r\nLoading SparkR\r\nCreating a new generic function for ‘as.data.frame’ in package ‘SparkR’\r\nCreating a new generic function for ‘colnames’ in package ‘SparkR’\r\nCreating a new generic function for ‘colnames<-’ in package ‘SparkR’\r\nCreating a new generic function for ‘cov’ in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExtracting millennium, century, decade, millisecond, microsecond and epoch from datetime is neither ANSI standard nor quite common in modern SQL platforms. Most of the systems listing below does not support these except PostgreSQL and redshift.\r\n\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions050.htm\r\n\r\nhttps://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/datetime.html\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-8-x/topics/impala_datetime_functions.html\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions-date-time.html#label-supported-date-time-parts\r\n\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT\r\n\r\nThis PR removes these extract fields support from extract function for date and timestamp values\r\n\r\n`isoyear` is PostgreSQL specific but `yearofweek` is more commonly used across platforms\r\n`isodow` is PostgreSQL specific but `iso` as a suffix is more commonly used across platforms so, `dow_iso` and `dayofweek_iso` is used to replace it.\r\n\r\nFor historical reasons, we have [`dayofweek`, `dow`] implemented for representing a non-ISO day-of-week and a newly added `isodow` from PostgreSQL for ISO day-of-week. Many other systems only have one week-numbering system support and use either full names or abbreviations. Things in spark become a little bit complicated. \r\n1. because of the existence of `isodow`, so we need to add iso-prefix to `dayofweek` to make a pair for it too. [`dayofweek`, `isodayofweek`, `dow` and `isodow`] \r\n2. because there are rare `iso`-prefixed systems and more systems choose `iso`-suffixed way, so we may result in [`dayofweek`, `dayofweekiso`, `dow`, `dowiso`]\r\n3. `dayofweekiso` looks nice and has use cases in the platforms listed above, e.g. snowflake, but `dowiso` looks weird and no use cases found.\r\n4. with a discussion the community，we have agreed with an underscore before `iso` may look much better because `isodow` is new and there is no standard for `iso` kind of things, so this may be good for us to make it simple and clear for end-users if they are well documented too.\r\n\r\nThus, we finally result in [`dayofweek`, `dow`] for Non-ISO day-of-week system and [`dayofweek_iso`, `dow_iso`] for ISO system\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRemove some nonstandard and uncommon features as we can add them back if necessary\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO, we should target this to 3.0.0 and these are added during 3.0.0\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `verboseStringWithOperatorId`, use `output` (it's `Seq[Attribute]`) instead of `producedAttributes` (it's `AttributeSet`) to generates `\"Output\"` for the leaf node in order to make `\"Output\"` determined.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, Formatted Explain use `producedAttributes`, the `AttributeSet`,  to generate `\"Output\"`. As a result, the fields order within `\"Output\"` can be different from time to time. It's That means, for the same plan, it could have different explain outputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, user see the determined fields order within formatted explain now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a regression

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn Spark, we need do some hook after job cleaned, such as cleaning hive external temporary paths. This has already discussed in [GitHub Pull Request #28129](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28129).\r\nThe JobEnd Status is not suitable for this. As JobEnd is responsible for Job finished, once all result has generated, it should be finished. After finish, Scheduler will leave the still running tasks to be zombie tasks and delete abnormal tasks asynchronously.\r\nThus, we add JobCleaned Status to enable user to do some hook after all tasks cleaned in the job and add a JobCleanedListener to do some hooks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nrun all

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix Pyspark CrossValidator/TrainValidationSplit with pipeline estimator cannot save and load model.\r\n\r\nMost pyspark estimators/transformers inherit `JavaParams`, but some estimators are special (in order to support pure python implemented nested estimators/transformers):\r\n* Pipeline\r\n* OneVsRest\r\n* CrossValidator\r\n* TrainValidationSplit\r\n\r\nBut note that, currently, in pyspark, estimators listed above, their model reader/writer do NOT support pure python implemented nested estimators/transformers. Because they use java reader/writer wrapper as python side reader/writer.\r\n\r\nPyspark CrossValidator/TrainValidationSplit model reader/writer require all estimators define the `_transfer_param_map_to_java` and `_transfer_param_map_from_java` (used in model read/write).\r\n\r\nOneVsRest class already defines the two methods, but Pipeline do not, so it lead to this bug.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I add `_transfer_param_map_to_java` and `_transfer_param_map_from_java` into Pipeline class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR makes sure that AQE does not call update UI if the current execution ID does not match the current query. This PR also includes a minor refactoring that moves `getOrCloneSessionWithAqeOff` from `QueryExecution` to `AdaptiveSparkPlanHelper` since that function is not used by `QueryExecution` any more.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWithout this fix, there could be a potential deadlock.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix Pyspark CrossValidator/TrainValidationSplit with pipeline estimator cannot save and load model.\r\n\r\nMost pyspark estimators/transformers inherit `JavaParams`, but some estimators are special (in order to support pure python implemented nested estimators/transformers):\r\n* Pipeline\r\n* OneVsRest\r\n* CrossValidator\r\n* TrainValidationSplit\r\n\r\nBut note that, currently, in pyspark, estimators listed above, their model reader/writer do NOT support pure python implemented nested estimators/transformers. Because they use java reader/writer wrapper as python side reader/writer.\r\n\r\nPyspark CrossValidator/TrainValidationSplit model reader/writer require all estimators define the `_transfer_param_map_to_java` and `_transfer_param_map_from_java` (used in model read/write).\r\n\r\nOneVsRest class already defines the two methods, but Pipeline do not, so it lead to this bug.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I add `_transfer_param_map_to_java` and `_transfer_param_map_from_java` into Pipeline class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAlways translate date values of pushed down filters to `java.sql.Date` independently from the SQL config `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. For backward compatibility with existing implementations of datasources. For example, the following exception is thrown by ORC datasource when `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` is set to `true`:\r\n```\r\nWrong value class java.time.LocalDate for DATE.EQUALS leaf\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong value class java.time.LocalDate for DATE.EQUALS leaf\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.sarg.SearchArgumentImpl$PredicateLeafImpl.checkLiteralType(SearchArgumentImpl.java:192)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.sarg.SearchArgumentImpl$PredicateLeafImpl.<init>(SearchArgumentImpl.java:75)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.sarg.SearchArgumentImpl$BuilderImpl.equals(SearchArgumentImpl.java:352)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.orc.OrcFilters$.buildLeafSearchArgument(OrcFilters.scala:229)\r\n```\r\n2. Before the changes, date filters are not pushed down to Parquet datasource when `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` is `true`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test to `ParquetFilterSuite` and to `OrcFilterSuite`.","created_at":"2020-04-20T09:16:13Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:48:01Z","closed_at":"2020-04-26T22:49:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89729b6aacb3527e6cf8289d21af78b3bd3256a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28272/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28272/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28272/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2973dd795e739bb6845856388a9f882425d712e6","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-translateLeafNodeFilter","ref":"fix-translateLeafNodeFilter","sha":"2973dd795e739bb6845856388a9f882425d712e6","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n#26700 removed the ability to drop a row whose nested column value is null.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the following `df`:\r\n```\r\nval schema = new StructType()\r\n  .add(\"c1\", new StructType()\r\n    .add(\"c1-1\", StringType)\r\n    .add(\"c1-2\", StringType))\r\nval data = Seq(Row(Row(null, \"a2\")), Row(Row(\"b1\", \"b2\")), Row(null))\r\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data), schema)\r\ndf.show\r\n+--------+\r\n|      c1|\r\n+--------+\r\n|  [, a2]|\r\n|[b1, b2]|\r\n|    null|\r\n+--------+\r\n```\r\nIn Spark 2.4.4,\r\n```\r\ndf.na.drop(\"any\", Seq(\"c1.c1-1\")).show\r\n+--------+\r\n|      c1|\r\n+--------+\r\n|[b1, b2]|\r\n+--------+\r\n```\r\nIn Spark 2.4.5 or Spark 3.0.0-preview2, if nested columns are specified, they are ignored.\r\n```\r\ndf.na.drop(\"any\", Seq(\"c1.c1-1\")).show\r\n+--------+\r\n|      c1|\r\n+--------+\r\n|  [, a2]|\r\n|[b1, b2]|\r\n|    null|\r\n+--------+\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis seems like a regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNow, the nested column can be specified:\r\n```\r\ndf.na.drop(\"any\", Seq(\"c1.c1-1\")).show\r\n+--------+\r\n|      c1|\r\n+--------+\r\n|[b1, b2]|\r\n+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, if `*` is specified as a column, it will throw an `AnalysisException` that `*` cannot be resolved, which was the behavior in 2.4.4. Currently, in master, it has no effect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-19T21:27:18Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T06:11:26Z","closed_at":"2020-04-20T02:59:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc1ceb670ea05ff2d045d582defe28c26f674b06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28266/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28266/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28266/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/283fee179186aa4cf7ad51e1f45149764139794c","head":{"label":"imback82:SPARK-31256","ref":"SPARK-31256","sha":"283fee179186aa4cf7ad51e1f45149764139794c","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is to backport the fix of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28003, add a migration guide, update the PR description and add an end-to-end test case.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the SQL `RESET` command will reset the values of static SQL configuration to the default and remove the cached values of Spark Context Configurations in the current session. This PR fixes the bugs. After this PR, the `RESET` command follows its definition and only updates the runtime SQL configuration values to the default. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen we introduced the feature of Static SQL Configuration, we did not update the implementation of  SQL `RESET` command.\r\n\r\nThe static SQL configuration should not be changed by any command at runtime. However, the `RESET` command resets the values to the default. We should fix them.   \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nBefore Spark 2.4.6, the `RESET` command resets both the runtime and static SQL configuration values to the default. It also removes the cached values of Spark Context Configurations in the current session, although these configuration values are for displaying/querying only. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded an end-to-end test and a unit test\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-19T18:54:11Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T00:38:33Z","closed_at":"2020-04-19T23:25:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"246ff2763ef447fefe9bbb01d22df428eaaab9b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28262/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28262/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28262/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/96dc679a590b58a9edc231b4401939b8182ed513","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:spark-31234followup2.4","ref":"spark-31234followup2.4","sha":"96dc679a590b58a9edc231b4401939b8182ed513","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMove slots check of barrier job from `DAGScheduler` to `TaskSchedulerImpl` and add new configuration `spark.scheduler.barrier.waitForEnoughSlots.timeout` to replace with `spark.scheduler.barrier.maxConcurrentTasksCheck.interval`/ `spark.scheduler.barrier.maxConcurrentTasksCheck.maxFailures`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe do the slots check for a barrier job to ensure the job can be launched finally. We'll continuously resubmit the same job until we pass the check(find enough slots after some executors registered at driver). Thus, it introduces duplicate DAG planning for the same job, which may low down the throughput of the `DAGSchedule`. And it seems DAG planning could always be faster than executor launching, which makes duplicate DAG planning inevitable. Besides, we actually already did the similar slots check inside `TaskSchedulerImpl`. We can combine them as well.\r\n\r\nOne obvious benefit we can get after this improvement is reducing the time of barrier tests, e.g.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] BarrierTaskContextSuite:\r\n[info] - global sync by barrier() call (18 seconds, 972 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - share messages with allGather() call (17 seconds, 95 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - throw exception if we attempt to synchronize with different blocking calls (16 seconds, 222 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - successively sync with allGather and barrier (17 seconds, 532 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - support multiple barrier() call within a single task (17 seconds, 792 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - throw exception on barrier() call timeout (17 seconds, 85 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - throw exception if barrier() call doesn't happen on every task (17 seconds, 166 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - throw exception if the number of barrier() calls are not the same on every task (17 seconds, 149 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - barrier task killed, no interrupt (16 seconds, 777 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - barrier task killed, interrupt (16 seconds, 208 milliseconds)\r\n[info] ScalaTest\r\n[info] Run completed in 2 minutes, 54 seconds.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n[info] BarrierTaskContextSuite:\r\n[info] - global sync by barrier() call (6 seconds, 694 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - share messages with allGather() call (5 seconds, 885 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - throw exception if we attempt to synchronize with different blocking calls (5 seconds, 384 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - successively sync with allGather and barrier (6 seconds, 973 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - support multiple barrier() call within a single task (6 seconds, 979 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - throw exception on barrier() call timeout (6 seconds, 158 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - throw exception if barrier() call doesn't happen on every task (6 seconds, 211 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - throw exception if the number of barrier() calls are not the same on every task (6 seconds, 171 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - barrier task killed, no interrupt (4 seconds, 776 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - barrier task killed, interrupt (5 seconds, 190 milliseconds)\r\n[info] ScalaTest\r\n[info] Run completed in 1 minute, 3 seconds.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, user can not use `spark.scheduler.barrier.maxConcurrentTasksCheck.interval`/ `spark.scheduler.barrier.maxConcurrentTasksCheck.maxFailures` any more since Spark 3.0 but should use \r\n`spark.scheduler.barrier.waitForEnoughSlots.timeout` instead.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated existed tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-19T16:51:59Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T13:03:55Z","closed_at":"2020-05-07T13:03:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"620a134c5f7849ebbf9359c3f0419751225e3cec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28260/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28260/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28260/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fdb7840c1660be07d8801b92bd86d5c57787921e","head":{"label":"Ngone51:impr_barrier_slots_check","ref":"impr_barrier_slots_check","sha":"fdb7840c1660be07d8801b92bd86d5c57787921e","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Modified `ParquetFilters.valueCanMakeFilterOn()` to accept filters with `java.time.LocalDate` attributes.\r\n2. Modified `ParquetFilters.dateToDays()` to support both types `java.sql.Date` and `java.time.LocalDate` in conversions to days.\r\n3. Add implicit conversion from `LocalDate` to `Expression` (`Literal`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support pushed down filters with `java.time.LocalDate` attributes. Before the changes, date filters are not pushed down to Parquet datasource when `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` is `true`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test to `ParquetFilterSuite`","created_at":"2020-04-19T15:58:53Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:48:03Z","closed_at":"2020-04-24T02:22:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cae4c977a86b45b3ae40156c4562c5a6b89d19a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28259/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28259/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28259/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/54512cd04deeaa8732b216ca0d65d4ce467fdafe","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:parquet-filter-java8-date-time","ref":"parquet-filter-java8-date-time","sha":"54512cd04deeaa8732b216ca0d65d4ce467fdafe","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThese changes implement an application wait mechanism which will allow spark-submit to wait until the application finishes in Standalone Spark Mode. This will delay the exit of spark-submit JVM until the job is completed. This implementation will keep monitoring the application until it is either finished, failed or killed. This will be controlled via a flag (spark.submit.waitForCompletion) which will be set to false by default.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, Livy API for Standalone Cluster Mode doesn't know when the job has finished. If this flag is enabled, this can be used by Livy API (/batches/{batchId}/state) to find out when the application has finished/failed. This flag is Similar to spark.yarn.submit.waitAppCompletion.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR introduces a new flag but it will be disabled by default.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCouldn't implement unit tests since the pollAndReportStatus method has System.exit() calls. Please provide any suggestions. \r\nTested spark-submit locally for the following scenarios:\r\n1. With the flag enabled, spark-submit exits once the job is finished. \r\n2. With the flag enabled and job failed, spark-submit exits when the job fails.\r\n3. With the flag disabled, spark-submit exists post submitting the job (existing behavior).\r\n4. Existing behavior is unchanged when the flag is not added explicitly.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-19T15:34:35Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T14:29:46Z","closed_at":"2020-06-09T14:29:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a2ab684ecc943be811876ea52b4aa049ccb29b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28258/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28258/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28258/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e152f4b6fd65ac5f8706fa59c1afa74bbb2df53","head":{"label":"akshatb1:master","ref":"master","sha":"0e152f4b6fd65ac5f8706fa59c1afa74bbb2df53","user":{"login":"akshatb1","id":31816865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31816865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1","html_url":"https://github.com/akshatb1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a42af817065d2f0a57e6dce86a5d9345c2ebbc6f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/e

Thus, throw exception inside `resourceOffers` won't fail the application.\r\n\r\n As a result, if a barrier stage fail the require check at `require(addressesWithDescs.size == taskSet.numTasks, ...)`, the barrier stage will fail the check again and again util all tasks from `TaskSetManager` dequeued.

But I think not using `ipython` to run find_spark_home is better because ipython is more of a frontend. Besides, with this fix, we can open SparkSession-enabled jupyter notebook session via\r\n\r\n```\r\nPYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=jupyter PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS=notebook  pyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Add a `StopExecutor` call to executors before killing them.\r\n- This revert SPARK-29152 (#26810)\r\n\r\nA similar patch is tested here #26901 \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen executors do not goes down gracefully, their `stop()` method is never called. To solve this problem, a shutdown hook was used to execute the `stop()` method. \r\nInstead of forcing a shutdown hook, we should just add a `StopExecutor` call to executors before they are killed.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Generate rebasing arrays for micros up to 2037 in `RebaseDateTimeSuite.generateRebaseJson()`.\r\n2. Exclude 4 time zones from the black list in `generateRebaseJson()`.\r\n3. Re-generate JSON files with rebasing info - `gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json` and `julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. `sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo` resolves DST after 2037 year incorrectly. See https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u/blob/aa318070b27849f1fe00d14684b2a40f7b29bf79/jdk/src/share/classes/sun/util/calendar/ZoneInfo.java#L55-L62 . By restricting the rebase arrays to 2037 year, we follow the behaviour of `ZoneInfo` which uses DST of 2037 for all years beyond 2037.\r\n2. To enable optimization of micros rebasing via switch arrays for the time zones:\r\n    - Asia/Tehran\r\n    - Iran\r\n    - Africa/Casablanca\r\n    - Africa/El_Aaiun\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites `RebaseDateTimeUtils`, `DateTimeUtilsSuite` and `DateFunctionsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-18T09:23:46Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:47:55Z","closed_at":"2020-04-20T06:35:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15f85f5506a7f0baf52ad7a0f8467333b60efe58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28253/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28253/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28253/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/052a70ac8d2c656100b12f88f1eb749ccfb6943c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-4-time-zones-rebasing","ref":"fix-4-time-zones-rebasing","sha":"052a70ac8d2c656100b12f88f1eb749ccfb6943c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports #28217 to `branch-3.0`, making each id attribute for page navigations in a page unique.\r\n\r\nPagedTable#pageNavigation returns HTML elements representing a page navigation for a paged table.\r\nIn the current implementation, the method generates an id and it's used for id attribute for a set of elements for the page navigation.\r\nBut some pages have two page navigations so there are two set of elements where corresponding elements have the same id.\r\nFor example, there are two form-completedJob-table-page id in JobsPage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nEach id attribute should be unique in a page.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI added a test case for pageNavigation extended.\r\nI also manually tested that there were no warning messages for the uniqueness in JobsPage and JobPage.","created_at":"2020-04-17T17:01:04Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T20:45:06Z","closed_at":"2020-04-17T20:44:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"373f016885fb88a00b73d227d1b071c8462c0f86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRewrite the periodically check logic of  `abortableRpcFuture` to make sure that barrier task would always return either desired messages or expected exception.\r\n\r\nThis PR also simplify a bit around `AbortableRpcFuture`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, the periodically check logic of  `abortableRpcFuture` is done by following:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n...\r\nvar messages: Array[String] = null\r\n\r\nwhile (!abortableRpcFuture.toFuture.isCompleted) {\r\n   messages = ThreadUtils.awaitResult(abortableRpcFuture.toFuture, 1.second)\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\nreturn messages\r\n```\r\nIt's possible that `abortableRpcFuture` complete before next invocation on `messages = ...`. In this case, the task may return null messages or execute successfully while it should throw exception(e.g. `SparkException` from `BarrierCoordinator`).\r\n\r\nAnd here's a flaky test which caused by this bug:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] BarrierTaskContextSuite:\r\n[info] - share messages with allGather() call *** FAILED *** (18 seconds, 705 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Could not recover from a failed barrier ResultStage. Most recent failure reason: Stage failed because barrier task ResultTask(0, 2) finished unsuccessfully.\r\n[info] java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n[info] \tat scala.collection.mutable.ArrayOps$ofRef$.length$extension(ArrayOps.scala:204)\r\n[info] \tat scala.collection.mutable.ArrayOps$ofRef.length(ArrayOps.scala:204)\r\n[info] \tat scala.collection.IndexedSeqOptimized.toList(IndexedSeqOptimized.scala:285)\r\n[info] \tat scala.collection.IndexedSeqOptimized.toList$(IndexedSeqOptimized.scala:284)\r\n[info] \tat scala.collection.mutable.ArrayOps$ofRef.toList(ArrayOps.scala:198)\r\n[info] \tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.BarrierTaskContextSuite.$anonfun$new$4(BarrierTaskContextSuite.scala:68)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test exception can be reproduced by changing the line `messages = ...` to the following:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nmessages = ThreadUtils.awaitResult(abortableRpcFuture.toFuture, 10.micros)\r\nThread.sleep(5000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually test and update some unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-17T14:28:29Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T00:28:41Z","closed_at":"2020-04-21T10:13:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b50dd46a7b7d8cb5d426cae701d8b0caa3e5aac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8a741702aca6a8c61b51873d806639b1a6c3ae49","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix_barrier","ref":"fix_barrier","sha":"8a741702aca6a8c61b51873d806639b1a6c3ae49","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror
