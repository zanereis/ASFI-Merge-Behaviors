table schema for `T + 1` incomplete, for example, when 2 (or more) metrics, `metrics_1` and `metrics_2` are the same function type (`metrics_longavg`), when deleting history tables for `metrics_1`, it will delete all tables in the pattern `metrics_longavg_\\d{8}` except for the `[T - ttl, T]`, and a new table `metrics_longavg_<T+1>` is created, but at the same time when deleting the same for `metrics_2`, it will delete all tables except for `[T - ttl, T]`, causing the newly created `metrics_longavg_<T+1>` be deleted, and the data columns for `metrics_1` is gone.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-27T11:31:15Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T13:24:14Z","closed_at":"2023-03-27T13:24:09Z","merged_at":"2023-03-27T13:24:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"de047de87cb7c769ceacdfc1ccc4235b4005c873","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":283421094,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM0MjEwOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":"Something

But some service will use this exponentialHistogram instead of histogram metric, such as [statsd receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/statsdreceiver/README.md) in opentelemetry collector.

I design the ui with reference to Amazon CloudWatch, and they use a method called `PERIOD`, Is there such a function in mal?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74546965/218268991-e889a315-24c2-4261-82eb-de09df29987a.png)\r\ndoc is [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html)\r\n2. The read usage meter is like\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74546965/218269298-d6425b8f-a325-4442-8d3f-8aa55e6ad247.png)\r\nBut the real data is always 1\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74546965/218269410-f3e02379-cc76-40d2-b08e-ef7fc033f57d.png)\r\nI think it should be a horizontal line rather than a diagonal line? And is it because of my mal's `avg` function?\r\n(also, I find I'm still not familiar with the metric model, are there any articles that go into detail about the metric model?)\r\n3. About how to set service level and instance level, I think that DynamoDB is based on table. So I set table as instance level, and set AWS account ID as service level , is that ok?\r\n\r\nTODO: \r\n1. set up service level dashboard.\r\n2. try to test left metrics :\r\nmetrics I have not tested: \r\n①read/write_throttled_requests\r\n②read/write_throttle_events\r\n③read/wirte system error\r\n④user error\r\n⑤conditional_check_failed_requests\r\n⑥transaction_conflict\r\n3. add ui

v0.7.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/tree/v0.7.0), it's incompatible with [existing opentelemetry-proto in SkyWalking](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/tree/master/oap-server/server-receiver-plugin/receiver-proto/src/main/proto/opentelemetry/proto) as some field names changed.  \r\nTo ensure `FirehoseHTTPHandler` works correctly, `aws-firehose-receiver` must parse ExportMetricsServiceRequest through v0.0.7 proto.\r\nSo  I copied the metrics part of OTEL v0.7.0 proto to`aws-firehose-receiver`(because aws-firehose-receiver only processes metrics data), and  changed the `java_package` to avoid class conflict\r\n`org.apache.skywalking.oap.server.receiver.aws.firehose.OtelMetricsConvertor` is responsible to convert ExportMetricsServiceRequest of v0.7.0 to  ExportMetricsServiceRequest of [existing opentelemetry-proto in
