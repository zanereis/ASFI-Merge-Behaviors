Description ##\r\nAdds L1 Norm operator.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- L1Norm\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Should this have a sparse implementation? L1 norms are usually sparse when compared to l2.\r\n- @haojin2 @eric-haibin-lin

Description ##\r\nmx.nd.WarpCTC will work in gluon only after add correct input arguments.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-06T11:32:46Z","updated_at":"2018-06-07T03:13:54Z","closed_at":"2018-06-06T17:57:51Z","merged_at":"2018-06-06T17:57:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"aafbd17460da31a31414a501f99a3e4a2346efe9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/cf72d01bdde55f197666d77cdce09d9976094de1","head":{"label":"arcadiaphy:fix-warpctc","ref":"fix-warpctc","sha":"cf72d01bdde55f197666d77cdce09d9976094de1","user":{"login":"arcadiaphy","id":4437140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzcxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4437140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy","html_url":"https://github.com/arcadiaphy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115413497,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU0MTM0OTc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"arcadiaphy/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arcadiaphy","id":4437140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzcxNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4437140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy","html_url":"https://github.com/arcadiaphy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arcadiaphy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arcadiaphy/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

for new Maven package. I also made a lot of changes to the setup instructions as listed below:\r\n\r\n## Install page\r\nLinux: http://35.170.70.99/install/index.html?platform=Linux&language=Scala&processor=CPU\r\nMac: http://35.170.70.99/install/index.html?platform=MacOS&language=Scala&processor=CPU\r\nWindows: http://35.170.70.99/install/index.html?platform=Windows&language=Scala&processor=CPU\r\n \r\n## A NEW Scala setup page\r\nhttp://35.170.70.99/install/scala_setup.html\r\nI did that so I wasn’t repeating so much information across both Mac and Linux.\r\nI also pulled the install (from source) info that was on the tutorials page over here and flagged it as reference only.\r\nNOTE: I used a non-existent link in the expectation that a demo app will be added for users to test out their installation: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/scala-package/mxnet-demo\r\n \r\n## Ubuntu setup page\r\nhttp://35.170.70.99/install/ubuntu_setup.html#install-the-mxnet-package-for-scala\r\nI moved this info to the Scala setup page and put in some reference links.\r\n \r\n## Windows setup page\r\nhttp://35.170.70.99/install/windows_setup.html#installing-the-mxnet-package-for-scala\r\nI removed the info and replaced it with the not available message.\r\n \r\n## Mac setup page\r\nhttp://35.170.70.99/install/osx_setup.html#install-the-mxnet-package-for-scala\r\nI moved this info to the Scala setup page and put in some reference links.\r\n \r\n## Scala tutorials index page\r\nhttp://35.170.70.99/tutorials/scala/\r\nI renamed the readme to index so that it renders properly on the website. I cleaned it up by moving setup info to the new setup page.\r\nI also had to update the whitelist for this page: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11152/files#diff-3906b3ef981ce8ed68acbf0541ed2948\r\n \r\n## Tutorials index page\r\nhttp://35.170.70.99/tutorials/index.html#scala-tutorials\r\nI added a link to the scala index page and one for the examples folder on github.\r\n \r\n## Scala with IntelliJ tutorial\r\nhttp://35.170.70.99/tutorials/scala/mxnet_scala_on_intellij.html\r\nThis was the core of my original PR that was a month old, and an ungodly amount of merge conflicts were resolved.\r\n \r\n## Bugs in infer example readme’s – I noticed these while trying to get the validation steps working.\r\n* https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11152/files#diff-c6de79d68ee210c61316bf3d175b490a\r\n*

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis is fixing a number of issues with handling BLAS libraries with cmake:\r\n\r\n[[MXNET-115]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-115) USE_LAPACK is forced on all platforms\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/8702 [DISCUSSION] Should we deprecate Makefile and only use CMake?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/8532 mxnet-mkl (v0.12.0) crash when using (conda-installed) numpy with MKL // (general MKL handling in comments)\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10175 MXNet MKLDNN build dependency/flow discussion\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9868 MKL and CMake\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9105 libmxnet.so load path

comments)\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/7852 Trouble installing MXNet on Raspberry Pi 3\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] The PR title start starts with [[MXNET-679]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-679)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are not affected by this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Moved all BLAS library handling to a separate module\r\n- [x] LAPACK is handled properly and separately for different BLAS libs\r\n- [x] Added LAPACK functionality when using Accelerate\r\n- [x] Moved MKLML handling to a separate module\r\n- [x] MKLML will be downloaded only if needed (previously always)\r\n- [x] Enabled MKLML for mac\r\n- [x] Added documentation for BLAS option in the cmake file\r\n- [x] Made MKLML / MKLDNN separation that finally makes sense (see https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/9868)\r\n- [x] Defined and documented the recommended order for checking availability of BLAS libraries (from most recommended to usual)\r\n- [x] Disabled MKL, MKLML, MKLDNN for not desktop platforms and cross compilation\r\n- [x] Switched on LAPACK for arm and android builds\r\n- [x] Standardised android arm builds\r\n- [x] Upgraded OpenBLAS version for cross-compilation to v0.3.2\r\n- [x] Used standard random generators instead of rand_r for openmp threads used in rnn\r\n- [x] Pinned dockcross images for android_armv7 android_arm64 to custom build and stable ones\r\n- [x] Upgraded MKLML to v0.17-rc\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- USE_MKLML_MKL was renamed to USE_MKLML due to common sense\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-05T09:50:12Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T16:49:04Z","closed_at":"2018-11-22T10:45:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d96d0a592fc4e2fec3559f6d64af993d78f3fd51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nChanges that were made to publish the packages to Maven, some of the changes were already committed by the Maven Release plugin on my behalf - I have disabled this functionality. Currently it will only create a tag on the local repo when you run release-prepare.\r\n\r\nIn brief.\r\n- We will build the MXNet backend during the compilation of init package only for `apache-release` profile.\r\n- Disabled automatically committing to Git and instead only locally commit.\r\n- Reduce the number of packages to be published to 3 platform specific platforms.\r\n- Flatten pom files during the build phase -- otherwise the package cannot be used and we need to publish POM files.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-05T06:42:50Z","updated_at":"2018-06-08T00:58:53Z","closed_at":"2018-06-07T22:53:24Z","merged_at":"2018-06-07T22:53:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"60dff17e6a4e7d9c8f05acba4502c42b65f21330","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/8a988e260d4cb51d16fc1627fda3520de266e9b6","head":{"label":"nswamy:v1.2.0-fix","ref":"v1.2.0-fix","sha":"8a988e260d4cb51d16fc1627fda3520de266e9b6","user":{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111612937,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE2MTI5Mzc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"nswamy/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThe SetDevice() call for pinned_ctx in KVStore causes extra memory allocation on GPU 0. Fixing it by skipping the `SetDevice()` call\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-05T01:10:34Z","updated_at":"2019-09-02T23:35:28Z","closed_at":"2018-06-05T04:06:10Z","merged_at":"2018-06-05T04:06:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"247d57944f7a989d8f445856769e704b83765828","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/32fd7d1ad2f1d2e9036f4021fa53443293272b41","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:pinned","ref":"pinned","sha":"32fd7d1ad2f1d2e9036f4021fa53443293272b41","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis is the second proposed solution to this: #11123 \r\nAdd Java doc support.\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres\r\nBe aware, I have imported a third party library to generate the Scala doc. Please check the pom file carefully.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-04T23:37:40Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T17:17:45Z","closed_at":"2018-06-12T16:21:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97de275f56ce4f72bf590da7c76b8b123a40f5fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11143/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11143/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11143/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4da6661b60a848d366669a5964dc5aa490593eb7","head":{"label":"lanking520:javadoc-fix","ref":"javadoc-fix","sha":"4da6661b60a848d366669a5964dc5aa490593eb7","user":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123362138,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMzNjIxMzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"lanking520/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add new operator translations\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- @spidyDev @Roshrini @sandeep-krishnamurthy

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\n\r\nThere are two problems in the ordering operators, i.e, topk, sort, argsort:\r\n\r\n1) Only real_t is supported.\r\n\r\n2) The indices are stored as real_t. This will cause error in the backward pass where the gradient are passed to the wrong locations.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can not run the following code in the previous version:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport mxnet.ndarray as nd\r\n\r\nctx = mx.cpu()\r\n\r\na = mx.nd.arange(54686454, ctx=ctx, dtype=np.int32)\r\na.attach_grad()\r\n\r\nk = 10\r\nwith mx.autograd.record():\r\nb = mx.nd.topk(a, k=k, ret_typ='value')\r\nb.backward(mx.nd.ones((k,), ctx=ctx, dtype=np.int32))\r\na_grad = a.grad.asnumpy()\r\nfor i in range(-1, - k - 1, -1):\r\nassert a_grad[i] == 1\r\n\r\n```\r\n~~I propose to fix this bug by changing the dtype of indices to int32. This will make the code **backward incompatible**. However, it only breaks some rare usages. Normally we will directly output the indices or use them to slice a tensor. The current change do not break these common usages.~~ (I have used the other solution mentioned below.)\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to support an additional flag `dtype` for these operators (as suggested in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11031). The problem of this solution is that we cannot avoid a nested macro, which is extremely slow to compile. So I haven't solved it this way.\r\n```c++\r\nMACRO_SWITCH(dtype, DType, {\r\n   MACRO_SWITCH(idtype, IDType, {\r\n      ...\r\n   });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes the issue reported in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10085 that ordering ops do not support kNullOp.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Arbitrary dtype (exclude float16) for ordering operators, tests\r\n- [x] For topk, argsort, add the dtype option to specify the type of the output indices, tests\r\n- [x] Fix the bug that ordering ops do not support kNullOp, tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- ~~This change is backward incompatible. However, I think it's reasonable to set the dtype of indices to int32 because it does not break the common usage where we use these indices to slice a tensor.~~ The change is backward compatible now.\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-04T08:58:02Z","updated_at":"2018-08-20T13:57:58Z","closed_at":"2018-08-20T13:57:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03389608cd9c310a50f3a3d424b6a5d0d2492e7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c4bae4dc7b44d36bccfe98f8871bff1a034705a0","head":{"label":"sxjscience:fix_order","ref":"fix_order","sha":"c4bae4dc7b44d36bccfe98f8871bff1a034705a0","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44923569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDkyMzU2OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sxjscience/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admi

Description ##\r\nThis is a bug fix and feature addition PR:\r\n~~1. Create an individual handler for new NDArray API. Current handler cannot correctly identify NDArray in the map and cause the issue.~~\r\n1. Change current GenericFunctionInvoke to support new API\r\n2. Add new default parameter \"out\" in every of the functions.\r\n\r\nI also hide the unsupported underscore function for old API and add \"_crop_assign\" function in NDArray since we need that.\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nThis is an experimental PR used to find a best way to generate Javadoc for Scala\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu \r\nHere are two solution I proposed:\r\n1. use new API signature to replace the old one (this PR)\r\n2. create signature for old api and not change the current functions\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [x] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

[MXNET-JIRA_ID], where JIRA_ID refers to the relevant JIRA issue created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-PR_ID/BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n\r\n- Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\nWe implemented  dot(dns,csr/csr.T)=dns on cpu inspired by the implementation  of dot(dns,csr/csr.T)=dns on gpu by @haojin2 . It gains 190 times speed up when density of csr is 0.01%.

Description ##\r\nThis PR enables module.fit to accept data iterators that return already sliced lists of batches, 1 batch per device.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This PR does not change any behavior when used with current iterators producing a single batch for all devices but is necessary to handle iterators producing presliced data\r\n- Gluon (due to being more explicit) can handle such iterators without any changes, this change enables those iterators only for module.fit

Description ##\r\nONNX Unsqueeze op maps to expand dims. Added the support.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Unsqueeze op support\r\n- [x] Added operator test.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@anirudhacharya  @anirudh2290 @lupesko

So the crash is observed in [example/reinforcement-learning/a3c](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/reinforcement-learning/a3c). \r\n\r\nTherefore, the fix is to reorder the src format to dst format when the difference is detected.\r\n\r\nThe A3C case can pass with the fix. And verified the performance by [benchmark_score.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/image-classification/benchmark_score.py), there's no performance effect.

Description ##\r\nAs reported here: the makefile is not pointing to the correct MXNet root.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10223\r\n\r\nFixing\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-29T23:51:29Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T06:25:54Z","closed_at":"2018-05-30T06:25:54Z","merged_at":"2018-05-30T06:25:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"badd28294934bb20a9e353e21cb0a54b49d2b95e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11092/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11092/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11092/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/03f8863af6d44a9954d8850c206e6e7dd13cfb49","head":{"label":"ThomasDelteil:patch-24","ref":"patch-24","sha":"03f8863af6d44a9954d8850c206e6e7dd13cfb49","user":{"login":"ThomasDelteil","id":3716307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTYzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3716307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasDelteil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123640397,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2NDAzOTc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"ThomasDelteil/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ThomasDelteil","id":3716307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTYzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3716307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasDelteil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasDelteil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasDelteil/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

is a follow up for https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10783, the view is messed up in that PR so open this new one.\r\n\r\nThis is to fix the 'make clean USE_MKMLDNN=1' will download and build MKLDNN library issue. As suggested in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10783, the new solution is to define a mkldnn make target and integrate into current make dependency, this solution will be cleaner.  It also simplifies current mkldnn library build logic a little bit. One simplification is assume MKLDNNROOT and MKLROOT now share the same directory since we always download mklml and copy the headers/libs to MKLDNN lib directory. Since we used mkldnn.mk to handle build logic,  prepare_mkldnn.sh/prepare_mkl.sh is not needed anymore.","created_at":"2018-05-29T14:52:51Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T17:32:53Z","closed_at":"2018-06-27T17:32:53Z","merged_at":"2018-06-27T17:32:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4f4e765e8fa4f5aed32283c3eb21059b7d643ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11090/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11090/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11090/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/05f981cdb4f7655549d0ad57df6d4e57bc6c325d","head":{"label":"jinhuang415:latest_master","ref":"latest_master","sha":"05f981cdb4f7655549d0ad57df6d4e57bc6c325d","user":{"login":"jinhuang415","id":34262351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjYyMzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34262351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhuang415","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":116924050,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTY5MjQwNTA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"jinhuang415/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinhuang415","id":34262351,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjYyMzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34262351?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhuang415","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhuang415/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinhuang415/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

According to the code, if  target_stype is equal to  KRowSparseStorage, the implement of dot would map to dot(csr.T, dns)=row_sparse. However, haven't map it to dot(csr.T dns)=dns, when target_stype is equal to kDefaultStorage.  \r\n\r\n      if (!dispatched && lhs_stype == kCSRStorage && only_lhs_transpose && rhs_rsp_or_dns) {\r\n        // csr.T, rsp/dns -> rsp\r\n        target_stype = hint_has_value ? target_stype : kRowSparseStorage;\r\n        if (target_stype == kRowSparseStorage) {\r\n          dispatched = storage_type_assign(&out_stype, kRowSparseStorage,\r\n                                           dispatch_mode, DispatchMode::kFComputeEx);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n Obviously, we should add some lines to map dot to dot(csr.T, dns)=dns, the modified code is as below. \r\n\r\n      if (!dispatched && lhs_stype == kCSRStorage && only_lhs_transpose && rhs_rsp_or_dns) {\r\n        // csr.T, rsp/dns -> rsp\r\n        target_stype = hint_has_value ? target_stype : kRowSparseStorage;\r\n        if (target_stype == kRowSparseStorage) {\r\n          dispatched =

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nThis PR added an open-source LSTM RNN implementation, and also included benchmarks for comparison between different LSTM RNN backends and tools for measurements.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added `OpenLSTMRNN`, an LSTM RNN CUDA implementation to the MXNet C++ core library (`./src/operator/contrib/`).\r\n- [x] Added `TensorboardSpeedometer` and `TensorboardLogValidationMetricsCallback` for logging training and validation scores as training progresses.\r\n- [x] Added benchmarks in `example` directory for comparison between MXNet default, cuDNN, and `OpenLSTMRNN` backend implementations. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n-

$JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-25T20:58:01Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T19:46:26Z","closed_at":"2018-05-28T16:39:31Z","merged_at":"2018-05-28T16:39:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"0df58aef13bc7dcf152ddae3d3f4155e17ac6e51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/dfe5924585ff5d937a453809744af96e7db8f61e","head":{"label":"thomelane:website_tutorial_index","ref":"website_tutorial_index","sha":"dfe5924585ff5d937a453809744af96e7db8f61e","user":{"login":"thomelane","id":4902813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDI4MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4902813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane","html_url":"https://github.com/thomelane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":120793163,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjA3OTMxNjM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"thomelane/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thomelane","id":4902813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MDI4MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4902813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane","html_url":"https://github.com/thomelane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomelane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thomelane/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Jenkinsfile to call new job `restricted-website-publish`\r\n\r\n## Comments\r\nI would assume that the config in the Jenkins job for `Restrict where this project can be run` would be updated from `mxnetlinux-cpu` to `restricted-mxnetlinux-cpu`. However, I get an error if I try to do this:\r\n```\r\nThere’s no agent/cloud that matches this assignment. Did you mean ‘mxnetlinux-cpu’ instead of ‘restricted-mxnetlinux-cpu’?\r\n```\r\nOnce I get clarity on this, I can clone the build job and configure it to use the restricted naming.\r\n\r\n@marcoabreu

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nFixes for Android64\r\nAdded Android64 to CI\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-24T15:50:33Z","updated_at":"2018-06-19T19:25:57Z","closed_at":"2018-06-15T17:33:34Z","merged_at":"2018-06-15T17:33:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"ebf3777804ac15cb578e2ea4d34723a39fdc0181","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11055/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11055/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11055/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/64469506d5843811bdbfcd8670efb251d44495d0","head":{"label":"larroy:android","ref":"android","sha":"64469506d5843811bdbfcd8670efb251d44495d0","user":{"login":"larroy","id":928489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy","html_url":"https://github.com/larroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77059342,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzA1OTM0Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"larroy/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"larroy","id":928489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy","html_url":"https://github.com/larroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/larroy/mxnet","description":"This

Description ##\r\nThis is a instruction for users to build mxnet with mkldnn from source.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Known issues ##\r\n\r\nCan not enable opencv when build with gcc on macOS. #11048 \r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @zheng-da

Description ##\r\nThe Module and DataBatch has too many parameters in constructors. Follow Builder pattern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) to make it easier to construct.\r\n* Add Builder class for Module and DataBatch to simplify construction\r\n* ~~Add annotation to enable varargs in Java~~\r\n* Regarding the change in Symbol.scala, it is a bug fix. Because we should allow users to expose two outputs but with same name. for example, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/gluon/rnn/rnn_cell.py#L398\r\n\r\n## Checklist

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nadjust GPU memory pool strategy\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] add knob for minimum memory pool chunk size\r\n- [x] add option (`MXNET_GPU_MEM_POOL_TYPE=\"Round\"`) for using nearest power of 2 size for better memory reuse\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- fixes #10453 when using MXNET_GPU_MEM_POOL_TYPE=\"Round\". Before the change, memory size must be exact match to reuse the chunk in memory pool. For the workload in #10453, it required cudaMalloc for 55.45GB, whereas with the rounding the cudaMalloc call reduced to 1.32GB, during which the memory usage largely stayed the same. It also helped speed up workloads and improve stability with variations in size that cannot be hybridized

Description ##\r\nAdded more detailed error messages for potrf/potri as a response to #10964\r\nWe check a lot of conditions upfront, but don't check conditions that are too complex and would actually require writing a complex algorithm just for checking. For potrf, this is whether the input matrix is symmetric and positive definite, for potri this is whether the input matrix is indeed the output of a prior potrf-computation. To help the user in case of an error, we repeat these two unchecked preconditions on the input when displaying the error message. \r\n\r\nThere is a limit when we can provide such more useful messages. All cblas-routines do not return any error code (on CPU), so we can realistically cover only lapack routines (which are also the ones that have most complex preconditions). Getting the same type of more elaborate error messages on Cuda is also difficult, specifically as potri on GPU has to be implemented based on blas-routines and not as a single function call. \r\n\r\nAs a compromise, we will initially supply such advanced messages for the most common use cases only: potrf/potri on CPU. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nMinor pr. added rescaling of webcam input\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n \r\n@zhreshold

Description ##\r\nAdd standard ResNet data augmentation for ImageRecordIter.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this augmentation performs a \"random resized crop\", which crop the image with respect to a random aspect ratio, and a random area, and resize it to the desired size.\r\n\r\n- If `random_resized_crop=True`, existing `max_random_scale` and `min_random_scale` will be ignored.\r\n- If `random_resized_crop=False`, newly-added `max_random_area` and `min_random_area` will be ignored.\r\n\r\nBesides, color jittering and pca noise are added as additional data augmentation options.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-23T01:38:07Z","updated_at":"2018-09-17T17:32:27Z","closed_at":"2018-06-19T22:23:20Z","merged_at":"2018-06-19T22:23:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"ccee17672b23fa864f5c2e67d6bcea5ccff2979e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a0e30151aa17bfd5c45049c6777ca59845597549","head":{"label":"hetong007:resnet_aug","ref":"resnet_aug","sha":"a0e30151aa17bfd5c45049c6777ca59845597549","user":{"login":"hetong007","id":1289856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODk4NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007","html_url":"https://github.com/hetong007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132825374,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI4MjUzNzQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"hetong007/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hetong007","id":1289856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODk4NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007","html_url":"https://github.com/hetong007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hetong007/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

[ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nAt the moment, we download the entire cache from S3, amounting to up to 10GB of data. The problem here is that the download and the load parts have to run in sequence and especially the latter is quite slow (up to 4 minutes). This PR allows partial cache retrieval and parallelized loading.\r\n\r\nI have added a test file to verify the functionality of full and partial caching. I will not add it to CI as it messes with the Docker Daemon and could have negative side effects. In general, just run it locally if you'd like to make a modification.\r\n\r\nThings left:\r\n- [x] Login to Docker Hub (using Secrets Manager)\r\n- [x] Upload images to Docker Hub\r\n- [x] Modify Jenkinsfile that handels cache generation\r\n- [ ] Change Jenkins configuration to point to Docker Hub instead of S3 bucket\r\n- [x] Update documentation \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Move from S3 to Docker Hub\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nCherry picked from changes for NEWs and README and added some changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-21T22:32:07Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T20:52:10Z","closed_at":"2018-05-23T20:52:10Z","merged_at":"2018-05-23T20:52:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"30ca4e319cc5c2635c76fd718a01f6c521bd6922","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3534baaa2e498c42b10766e8d89d97f12dbb6e8c","head":{"label":"anirudh2290:news_update","ref":"news_update","sha":"3534baaa2e498c42b10766e8d89d97f12dbb6e8c","user":{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90307467,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDMwNzQ2Nw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"anirudh2290/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nJira ticket [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-434)\r\n\r\nAttempt to fix [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10866) bug.\r\n\r\nThe scala api currently does not track the datashape and labelshape of the module after a reshape call. Thus when the module forward pass checks to see if it needs a reshape it will always be comparing the new databatch shape to the originally binded shape instead of the current resized shape. \r\n\r\nThis change attempts to mimic the python API to properly track the current module shape. \r\n\r\nThe scala API overall looks to try to mimic the python api where it can but given the general default immutability of Scala objects, there may be other issue like this. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR

for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be
