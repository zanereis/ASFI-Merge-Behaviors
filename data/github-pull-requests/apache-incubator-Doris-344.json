Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIncrease compatibility with mysql\r\n  1. Added two system tables files and partitions\r\n  2. Improved the return logic of mysql error code to make the error code more compatible with mysql\r\n  3. Added lock/unlock tables statement and show columns statement for compatibility with mysql dump\r\n  4. Compatible with mysqldump tool, now you can use mysql dump to dump data and table structure from doris\r\n\r\nnow use mysqldump may ptint error message like \r\n```\r\n$ mysqldump -h127.0.0.1 -P9130 -uroot test_query_qa > a\r\nmysqldump: Error: 'errCode = 2, detailMessage = select list expression not produced by aggregation output (missing from GROUP BY clause?): `EXTRA`' when trying to dump tablespaces\r\n```\r\nThis error message not effect the export file, you can add `--no-tablespaces` to avoid this error\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [x] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSupport cancel outdated query after FE restart, through three steps:\r\n1. Add startTime to Frontend Info and pass it in the heartbeat between Frontend.\r\n2. Add the startTime of all Frontends to the heartbeat between Master and Backend.\r\n3. Backend identifies whether the query is out of date according to the startTime of Frontend.\r\n\r\nRecognizable obsolete select query: Master restart, other Frontend stop or restart.\r\nRecognizable obsolete load query: Master restart.\r\n\r\nIn the future, it is expected to support Backend to cancel outdated queries after failing to receive Master's heartbeat for a long time.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #7031) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-07T17:09:40Z","updated_at":"2022-07-24T00:11:14Z","closed_at":"2022-07-24T00:11:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b3d5ecec0d27ea25ad207c7f9472b316d7b00156","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4354739901,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBfSlxs8AAAABA5AOvQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/7032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/7032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/7032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/statuses/eb84fd4270b54aaec67064b45a3ab9d36f677d46","head":{"label":"xinyiZzz:be_cancel_fragment_after_fe_restart","ref":"be_cancel_fragment_after_fe_restart","sha":"eb84fd4270b54aaec67064b45a3ab9d36f677d46","user":{"login":"xinyiZzz","id":13197424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTk3NDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13197424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyiZzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":302905944,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDI5MDU5NDQ=","name":"incubator-doris","full_name":"xinyiZzz/incubator-doris","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinyiZzz","id":13197424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTk3NDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13197424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyiZzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyiZzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinyiZzz/incubator-doris","description":"Apache

## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen there are multiple fragments in the SQL execution plan, and the lower part of the fragment has Colocate join, it may cause the join nodes of other fragments to use Colocate join incorrectly. Therefore, olapTableScan reaches the incorrect be, and finally tablet not found appears.\r\n\r\nThe isColocateFragment(PlanFragment planFragment, PlanNode node) method of the Coordinator class will traverse all the downstream nodes of the node, whether it should only traverse the downstream node nodes belonging to planFragment\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently, when I read a bool type value from es, error may occur in some cases due to incorrect type processing.\r\nFor example, record inserted into es is something like\r\n`{\"index\":{\"_index\":\"es_index\",\"_type\":\"doc\"}}\r\n{ \"Boolean\": \"true\"}`\r\nin which `Boolean` is actually a string type. However, it is processed as a bool value currently.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-29T14:39:59Z","updated_at":"2022-03-19T08:10:05Z","closed_at":"2022-03-19T08:10:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3deb081992e22d441bd140a0470e32d69c0d4334","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. By default , Spark connector must write all fields value to `Doris` table .\r\nIn this feature , user can specify part of fields to write ,  even specify the order of the fields to write.\r\n\r\neg:\r\nI have a table named `student` which has three columns (name,gender,age) ,\r\ncreating table sql as following:\r\n```sql\r\ncreate table student (name varchar(255), gender varchar(10), age int) duplicate key (name) distributed by hash(name) buckets 2;\r\n```\r\nNow , I just want  to write values to two columns : name , gender.\r\nThe code as following:\r\n```scala\r\n    val df = spark.createDataFrame(Seq(\r\n      (\"m\", \"zhangsan\"),\r\n      (\"f\", \"lisi\"),\r\n      (\"m\", \"wangwu\")\r\n    ))\r\n    df.write\r\n      .format(\"doris\")\r\n      .option(\"doris.fenodes\", dorisFeNodes)\r\n      .option(\"doris.table.identifier\", dorisTable)\r\n      .option(\"user\", dorisUser)\r\n      .option(\"password\", dorisPwd)\r\n      //specify your fields or the order\r\n      .option(\"doris.write.field\", \"gender,name\")\r\n      .save()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Proposed changes\r\nwhen read the tablet with all columns for single rowset which !has_overlapping && nonoverlapping_count == 1 && !has_delete_rowset,  we should use _direct_agg_key_next_row, which can reduce useless aggregation when reading from rowset,   however  if we read less columns(most olap query should be),  use _agg_key_next_row should be better,  which  will do aggregation before return to next caller.  \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change
