of BeamZetaSqlCalcRel, using ZetaSQL evaluator for Calc.\r\n\r\nBeamZetaSqlCalcRel is not turned on by default in this PR, because it does not yet pass all the tests in ZetaSQLDialectSpecTest (currently 66% passing).\r\n\r\nTo use BeamZetaSqlCalcRel for evaluating ZetaSQL queries you need to set the rule sets to `BeamRuleSets.getZetaSqlRuleSets()` during configuration.\r\n\r\nr: @apilloud,

addresses BEAM-7434 which notes that the use of the java RabbitMQ client's `QueueingConsumer` is deprecated in the 4.x line and is slated for removal in 5.x. \r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n* upgrades the java library to 5.x (addressing BEAM-5894 and BEAM-5895)\r\n* replaces QueueingConsumer ([Consumer/push api](https://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#consuming)) with `Channel.basicGet` directly ([pull api](https://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#getting))\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThe 4.x use of QueueingConsumer was (presumably) done for two reasons: 1) thread safety between Channel/Consumer (see history notes in QueueingConsumer); 2) to apply backpressure on `push` by pushing to a blocking queue. Number 1 is no longer an issue, and I've circumvented number 2 by using a pull-based api rather than the consumer push-based.\r\n\r\nThere are some tradeoffs in place in this PR. Previously, using the push-based, Consumer api, messages could be internally buffered/queued by each shard of the unbounded source, which saves round-trip latency if there are messages ready. Both before and after my changes, \"prefetch\" values were set at the default \"unlimited\" (0) value so messages would enqueue/buffer as soon as they're able. The trade-off there would be higher memory usage, although it's unlikely this is a practical concern for many. \r\n\r\nUsing the pull-based api (`channel.basicGet`), each message pull will require a round-trip to the rabbitmq server, albeit on an already-open Connection. It should have a nice property where pulling is 'fairer' than the previous approach, as each shard will only request a message when explicitly prompted to by the Runner rather than potentially being unacked/buffered within some other shard. \r\n\r\nI'm expecting this API should not cause any real-world problems and the throughput should be high enough without local buffering. If local buffering/minimal round-trip time is of concern, I would suggest a follow-up PR allowing for configuring prefetch (and perhaps other QoS settings).\r\n\r\nNote this is not binary compatible with previous releases, both in terms of the underlying RabbitMQ API as well as the wire format of the Beam RabbitMqIO implementation as it switches from `QueueingConsumer.Delivery` to `GetResult`.\r\n\r\nR: @jbonofre \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

@aromanenko-dev, here is my idea of how KinesisIO could support enhanced fanout consumers using `subscribeToShard` from the AWS SDK v2. It's still WIP but I wanted to see what you think about the approach. As you probably know the main difference is that instead of polling getRecords() you subscribe to the shard with a callback. You also have to keep renewing the subscription every 5 minutes but subscribeToShard returns a CompletableFuture that completes when the subscription expires so you can just call join() then subscribeToShard() again in a loop. Other than that I think everything else is the same. So here's the approach I took:\r\n\r\n- I added a `consumerArn` param to KinesisIO.Read and plumbed that through to KinesisSource, DynamicCheckpointGenerator, ShardCheckpoint, and ShardRecordsIterator.\r\n- I added a `subscribeToShard` method to ShardCheckpoint that mirrors the starting position logic from getShardIterator. The exception is that it has a `resubscribe` param which will cause it to always subscribe from LATEST if true. \r\n- I added a `subscribeToShard` method to SimplifiedKinesisClient that handles calling `KinesisAsyncClient.subscribeToShard` and wraps any exceptions.\r\n- I added a `subscribeToShard` method to ShardRecordsIterator. This contains the Kinesis subscriber and error handler so this is where KinesisAsyncClient calls back to with `SubscribeToShardEvent`s. This is so we can apply the RecordFilter to the list of returned events after we deaggregate and convert each KinesisClientRecord to a KinesisRecord and before handing it to the consumer that was passed in as a parameter. The CompletableFuture from subscribeToShard gets passed back to this point where we call join(), so this method is blocking for the duration of the subscription. This could maybe use some work to make it more responsive to interruption.\r\n- The readLoop method in ShardReadersPool is where we poll when calling getRecords(). I added a `subscribeLoop` method that loops on ShardRecordsIterator.subscribeToShard() instead. In startReadingShards() we call ShardRecordsIterator.hasConsumer() which checks whether consumerArn is populated then we run either readLoop() or subscribeLoop() on the executor service accordingly.\r\n- I factored out a `putRecord` method in ShardReadersPool that gets called from readLoop() and also gets passed to ShardRecordsIterator.subscribeToShard() as the KinesisRecord consumer. This encapsulates putting the record onto `recordsQueue` and incrementing the per-shard record count.\r\n- ShardRecordsIterator keeps track of whether to call ShardCheckpoint.subscribeToShard() with resubscribe = true using a boolean field `resubscribe`. This starts as false and is only updated to true when ackRecord() is called so we can guarantee that we were able to subscribe from the initial checkpoint starting position successfully before we start subsequently resubscribing from LATEST. Possibly this resubscribe param is overkill and it would work just as well if you always subscribe from the latest checkpoint but I haven't tested that yet.\r\n\r\nI also converted the existing code to using the AWS SDK v2 exclusively, which meant removing the writer from the v2 KinesisIO for now as it does not appear that there's a KPL based on the v2 AWS SDK yet. I think this could be separated from adding the enhanced fanout support if you want though.\r\n\r\nwdyt?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added a standalone interactive utils module that provides functionality to detect if current execution is in an interactive notebook environment.\r\n2. Implicitly append a user label (goog-dataflow-notebook=$beam_version) to Dataflow jobs started from interactive notebook environment when the user does DataflowRunner().run_pipeline(p, options).\r\n3. User '--labels' doesn't support character '.' or '\"'. When applying version related label, replace '.' with '_' and avoid enclosing any label with '\"'.\r\n4. Fixed try-except condition in static imports of display_manager module. Future PRs will remove the usage of display_manager from interactive runner.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

triggers an infinite recursion in apache_beam.internal.pickler module. Beam catches RecursionError, and condsiders the pipeline not suitable for RunnerApi, and the test passes on Direct runner without further pickling. \r\nHowever on some versions of Python interpreter, under certain conditions, the Python interpreter fails to raise RecursionError, which unexpectedly causes the test to fail. This PR removes the recursion error, and explicitly disables RunnerAPI in the test. \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PR adds some features to `TestBigQuery` and `TestPubsub`, and modifies some integration tests to use these new features.\r\n\r\n### TestBigQuery\r\n- Add ability to insert data in the test table prior to running a test.\r\n- Can now assert on table data `now` as well as `eventually`.\r\n\r\n### TestPubsub\r\n- `TestPubsub` now initializes a randomized subscription when its created, so that users can pull all messages received during test execution.\r\n- Adds `TestPubsub#{pull, waitForNMessages, assertThatTopicEventuallyReceives}` for accessing received messages.\r\n\r\n### TestBigQueryReadWriteIT\r\n- Original `testSQLRead*` tests are renamed to `testSQLReadWrite*` since they test separate Read and Write SQL pipelines.\r\n- Add `testSQLRead` and `testSQLWrite` tests to just test read path and write path, respectively.\r\n\r\n### PubsubJsonIT\r\n- Modifies `testUsesDlq` to access dlq data with `TestPubsub#pull` instead of signaling (although this test is still ignored as I haven't verified that it no longer flakes).\r\n- Adds `testWritesJsonRowsToPubsub`.\r\n\r\n### DataCatalogBigQueryIT\r\n- Removes `writeToBqPipeline` and instead uses `TestBigQuery#insertRows` at the start of the test.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

failures occur on the data channel, the Process Bundle requests that depend on them should fail with the same error message. Further, since the data channel is suspect, no further reads should occur on that channel, and process bundle should terminate.\r\n\r\nPreviously, this would lead to bundles being stuck waiting forever for data, which would never arrive. Bad data channel errors include the GRPC receive buffer being set too small, from which there is no recovery for the pipeline, and clear bundle failure and abort is the only reasonable option.\r\n\r\nThis commit additionally makes logging a bit noisier and the context of each failure clearer.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a new Flink entry point (main method) that invokes the external SDK client entry point to generate the pipeline and submits the resulting Flink job like any other Flink native driver program would, via the optimizer plan environment (\"[auto]\").\r\n\r\nNote that in this PR, the SDK client is assumed to be on the same host, which is the case when Flink and Python dependencies are in the same container image, for example. While this is something that can be solved at build time, the question from Robert made me realize that the dependency is almost identical to that between the runner and SDK on the execution side, which is abstracted via the environment concept. So we could, in the future, consider introducing a \"client environment\" or simply expand the existing environment. This would allow the SDK bits for both pipeline construction and execution to live in a side car container, separate from Flink. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

discussed with https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9807 and [on the mailing

PNG resources are difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\nI volunteered with @echauchot to do the translation to PlantUML source and SVG resources.\r\n\r\nThere should be *no* change to the content of the sequence diagrams in this PR, just some styling due to the different tools.\r\n\r\nThe PlantUML source is embedded inside the SVG image, and can be used to regenerate the SVG.\r\n\r\n_**It IS possible**_ to include a `jekyll-plantuml` to have these resources built with the website (instead of manually when they are changed).  It would be moderately heavy solution for these few images.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a pipeline contains a PTransform which passes through its input PCollection during `expand()`, the `PipelineInfo` object may run into an infinite recursion error while constructing the derivation for said PCollection.\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents the infinite recursion by not marking a transform as a producer of PCollection if that PCollection is also an input to the transform.\r\n\r\nI've added a test for this, but without the fix, the test does not fail 100% of the time--it's dependent on the ordering of transforms in the Pipeline proto. Any advice on how to test this better is appreciated.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

commits to improve logging from the Go SDK harness, to prep for a more involved change to improve datamgr.go.\r\n* Logging call depths were spuriously one higher than they should have been. The lowest level in the standard logger was not adding 1 for it's own stack frame. This made logs refer to the wrong line if the standard logger was replaced.\r\n* It's been unclear if instructions that depend on others being active (like Progress and Split) were failing because their reference instruction was terminated or not. This change resolves that for error cases by repeating the root error message on those channels. To add clarity, I've added some light types to ensure we aren't getting our BundleIDs mixed up with our InstructionIDs, and renamed the trickier variables, since we were calling everything \"ref\".\r\n* Finally, if the data channel fails on receive, we were swallowing the root error and not logging it.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, adding some missing documentation lines for exported methods since the linter was unhappy with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

using fromQuery, BigQueryIO creates a temp dataset and table to store the results of the query. Therefore, Beam requires permissions to create datasets just to be able to run a query, a very broad permission. With this option, BigQueryIO can write the temp results of the query to a pre-existing dataset, and therefore it only needs permissions to run queries and create tables (inside that dataset, not in general) to be able to use from Query.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if we use `BigQueryIO.from` like in this example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nPCollection<TableRow> rows = p.apply(BigQueryIO.readTableRows().from(tableSpec));\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe only need to assign the role `roles/bigquery.jobUser` to the Apache Beam service (e.g. Dataflow) to be able to extract data from `tableSpec`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we want to read from a view, and we try the following code (where `query` is trying to extract data from a view) with that role, it will fail because it does not have permissions to create datasets (and `fromQuery` creates a temporary dataset and table):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nPCollection<TableRow> rows = \r\n    p.apply(BigQueryIO.readTableRows().fromQuery(query).usingStandardSql());\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in order to use views with `BigQueryIO` and Apache Beam, we need to give the role `roles/bigquery.user`. This role is much broader than `bigquery.jobUser`, and it allows the pipeline to create as many datasets as it would like in the project where it is reading data from.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, I am adding a new option to BigQueryIO, `withQueryTempDataset`, that makes it possible to set an existing dataset to create the necessary temporary tables. Thus, users wanting to limit the amount of permissions granted to Apache Beam could create a dataset prior to creating the pipeline, and assign permissions in that dataset only to the Apache Beam service account.\r\n\r\nThis is a much narrower set of permissions for the pipeline, confining the permission of the pipeline  to write in BigQuery only to the specified dataset. (compared to the current requirement to give permissions to create datasets anywhere in the project, in order to read from views).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

commits:\r\n\r\n1. Inline base class. It is clearer to have all test code inlined. If you must make a separate utility method, better to do it in the same class. Inheritance is almost never good in test classes.\r\n2. Use JUnit Parameterized test runner instead of utility method. Also converted to a PTransform instead of a method, which is good Beam style for pipelines. Also made the parameterized tests enclosed, because we could also have ITs that do not depend on SQL dialect.\r\n\r\nThe two commits are independent, please do not squash (for history to be most readable)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

reported in [BEAM-8347](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8347?focusedCommentId=16953004&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16953004) and discussed on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58421999/796064) the UnboundedRabbitMqReader has surprising watermarking behavior.\r\n\r\nNotably:\r\n- Watermarks only advance if new messages come through. It's easily the case that no new messages come through for some long periods of time, preventing downstream windows from closing.\r\n- The implementation of `getWatermark` runs counter to suggested documentation in the `UnboundedSource` documentation.\r\n\r\nFrom the `getWatermark` javadoc:\r\n\r\n> watermark] can be approximate. If records are read that violate this guarantee, they will be considered late, which will affect how they will be processed. ...\r\n> \r\n> However, this value should be as late as possible. Downstream windows may not be able to close until this watermark passes their end.\r\n> \r\n> For example, a source may know that the records it reads will be in timestamp order. In this case, the watermark can be the timestamp of the last record read. For a source that does not have natural timestamps, timestamps can be set to the time of reading, in which case the watermark is the current clock time.\r\n\r\nFrom the above, a Rabbit/queue-based client should be able to safely expect records read are in timestamp order. This implies the watermark should be the timestamp of the last record read (or 'now' if the records have no timestamp).\r\n\r\nThe current implementation uses the following logic for setting the watermark on a checkpoint:\r\n```java\r\n        currentTimestamp = new Instant(delivery.getProperties().getTimestamp());\r\n        if (currentTimestamp.isBefore(checkpointMark.oldestTimestamp)) {\r\n          checkpointMark.oldestTimestamp = currentTimestamp;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nThat is, the timestamp remains stuck at the *oldest* timestamp. The watermark effectively never advances until a call to `finalizeCheckpoint` is triggered, which often does not happen with low volumes of messages.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following significant changes to the implementation:\r\n1. When no new messages are available, the watermark advances to wall clock time\r\n2. When a new message is processed, watermark advances to delivery time (if present), else current time\r\n\r\nMonotonically advancing the watermark should be safe, even with 'split'/multi-consumers running against a single queue. Because it's a queue, processing for any given shard should be in consistent FIFO order. The client implementation also preserves in-order semantics of fetched messages. \r\n\r\nThis implementation is very similar to the implementation used in [AmqpIO](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/amqp/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/amqp/AmqpIO.java#L308) and analogous to the KafkaIO [ProcessingTimePolicy](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/kafka/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/kafka/TimestampPolicyFactory.java#L112)\r\n\r\nNOTE: I am having a hard time finding prior art on how to test an UnboundedSource.\r\n\r\nR: @jbonofre \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
