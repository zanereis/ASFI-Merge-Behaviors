just removed an extra space in the \"shape inconsistent\" message to make it display a bit more cleanly.)\r\n\r\nAlso, I added a bit of python code to print the arguments passed in to infer_shape() in

(https://github.com/andremoeller/mxnet/blob/r-doc-changes/docs/api/r/mxnet-r-reference-manual.pdf). This reference manual was generated from /R-package using rd2pdf. The Makefile has a line to copy the pdf into the HTML tree so it's hosted at mxnet.io/api/r/mxnet-r-reference-manual.pdf.\r\n\r\nIdeally the PDF would be built in the sphinx doc build rather than being added to the repo, but I'm not sure how to manage the R dependencies to do this with Sphinx. At any rate this seems like a decent interim measure so R has some API doc support in the short run -- better than nothing, I suppose.\r\n\r\nAlternative solutions

I have add the inception-resnet-v2 in mxnet, and test in the 17flowers dataset, It's ok to be convergent. I think many people will be interested it. And In order to test it ,  is it ok to push the 17flowers binary files to the  [http://data.dmlc.ml/mxnet/data](http://data.dmlc.ml/mxnet/data). In big model network like googlenet, inception-resnet-v2, I think that the 32x32 or 28x28 images are not suitable to make a test.\r\n\r\nAnd could anyone test this model in bigger DataSet like ImageNet. I have no enough resources to test it.\r\n\r\nThanks for such a good DL

core ability this gives is to allow certain kinds of reshape without requiring you to know all the dimensions up-front, in a more flexible way than the current codes 0 and -1. This make it easier for humans to express certain kinds of ops, but also makes it possible for machines to express certain reshapes without having to know exact sizes of irrelevant parts of the input. \r\n\r\nThat's what I'm using this for our fork: helping our neural network framework unroll recurrent networks more easily and efficiently. You typically can prove ahead of time that an unrolling algorithm is correct, and for speed reasons you do NOT want to track tensor dimensions during unrolling at run-time. But Reshape layer demands to know all tensor sizes even when the desired resize operation doesn't actually depend on them.\r\n\r\nSo this PR adds 3 more codes to Reshape that let it figure out more things itself:\r\n* -2: copy all remaining dimensions from input shape to output shape\r\n* -3: merge two adjacent dimensions in input shape\r\n* -4: split a single dimension in input shape into two (where either one can be inferred if given the other).\r\n\r\nIt should be pretty straightforward to add more codes in future, like maybe a code for merging all remaining dimensions. \r\n\r\nThese are documented formally in the description of \"target_shape\" with proper indices etc, the previous documentation was very vague.\r\n\r\nHere's an example that illustrates all three: let's say you want to 'broadcast' an operation across a sequence by simply merging the sequence and batch dimensions together and then doing an ordinary batched op. That kind of merge op can be expressed as a Reshape with target `(-3, -2)` -- merge the first two dimensions, then copy the rest. After you apply the op you'll want to do an unmerge: which is `(-4,slen,-1,-2)`. Notice that the only static information we needed to know here was the sequence length to unmerge properly. The dimensions and rank of the inner tensors was not needed. \r\n\r\nAnother example: any existing code will be able to replace any sequence of \"0s\" with a single \"-2\".","created_at":"2016-11-09T19:29:41Z","updated_at":"2016-11-24T09:02:29Z","closed_at":"2016-11-12T21:13:58Z","merged_at":"2016-11-12T21:13:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"52576527118eeee5a13a6ac3845ce6fa1dc1d01f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3781/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/3781/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/3781/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/ff541255e6e2d98c0b91ac8bcf6a9cae54da17e9","head":{"label":"taliesinb:feature/RichReshapeSpec","ref":"feature/RichReshapeSpec","sha":"ff541255e6e2d98c0b91ac8bcf6a9cae54da17e9","user":{"login":"taliesinb","id":365157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb","html_url":"https://github.com/taliesinb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73275570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzI3NTU3MA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"taliesinb/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"taliesinb","id":365157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/365157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb","html_url":"https://github.com/taliesinb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taliesinb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/taliesinb/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

padding layer `mx.Pad` that supports flexible padding: \n- Each tensor dimension can be padded at the start and end (but only special case of 2d images is supported right now, ie padding only the last two dimensions of a 4-tensor).\n- Two padding modes are supported at the moment: `\"constant\"` and `\"replicate\"`. `\"constant\"` pads with a constant value, 0 by default, with a custom value specifiable with the `padding_constant` option. `mx.Pad` with `\"constant\"` pad mode is equivalent to [tf.pad](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/api_docs/python/array_ops.html#pad) with `mode='CONSTANT'`. `\"replicate\"` pads with the tensor boundary values, and is equivalent Torch [SpatialReplicationPadding](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/convolution.md#nn.SpatialReplicationPadding) for the special case of image padding. The implementation was adapted from Torch.\n\nA general implementation will need to be added later.\n\nAlso note: `atomicAdd` was overloaded for `double` and `fp16` types. The latter needs to be carefully checked.
