for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- To add relevance score to evaluate nDCG in the function `ndcgAt`.\r\n- To extend the interface of constructor of `RankingMetrics` class.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- The precise definition of nDCG is [here on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain), where relevance score is used. Currently, the implementation of nDCG on spark (MLlib) treats this as binary (0 or 1). This PR is to extend the `ndcgAt` function to be able to treat relevance score.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n- I extended the interface of `RankingMetrics` class for `ndcgAt` function, so now it accepts `RDD[(Array[T], Array[T], Array[Double])]` or `RDD[(Array[T], Array[T])])` as the constructor arguments while the `RDD[(Array[T], Array[T])])` was only accepted.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- One test was added in [mllib/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/mllib/evaluation/RankingMetricsSuite.scala](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36843/files#diff-b85de09fb1428c03471c7c46305ebb9171964e9743d3ac5f4cd9bcb14bdcf6fd)\r\n <!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r","created_at":"2022-06-11T10:00:28Z","updated_at":"2022-06-20T06:58:23Z","closed_at":"2022-06-16T13:25:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee56e8d77226f87e7d1fd71e6fea8b095337f1e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36843/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36843/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36843/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a172172329cc78b50f716924f2a344517deb71fc","head":{"label":"uchiiii:add_relevance_to_ndcg","ref":"add_relevance_to_ndcg","sha":"a172172329cc78b50f716924f2a344517deb71fc","user":{"login":"uchiiii","id":32426869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDI2ODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32426869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii","html_url":"https://github.com/uchiiii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":502225300,"node_id":"R_kgDOHe9ZlA","name":"spark","full_name":"uchiiii/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uchiiii","id":32426869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDI2ODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32426869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii","html_url":"https://github.com/uchiiii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uchiiii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uchiiii/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update `PlanStabilitySuite` direction to prevent future mistakes.\r\n\r\n1. Add `SPARK_ANSI_SQL_MODE=true` explicitly because Apache Spark 3.3+ test coverage has ANSI and non-ANSI modes. We need to make it sure that both results are synced at the same time.\r\n```\r\n- SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt ...\r\n+ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt ...\r\n+ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 SPARK_ANSI_SQL_MODE=true ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The existing commands are human-readable but is not working. So, we had better have more simple command which is *copy-and-pasteable*.\r\n```\r\n- build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *PlanStability[WithStats]Suite\"\r\n+ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport of #36812.\r\n\r\nFixes `ArraySort` to throw an exception when the comparator returns `null`.\r\n\r\nAlso updates the doc to follow the corrected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen the comparator of `ArraySort` returns `null`, currently it handles it as `0` (equal).\r\n\r\nAccording to the doc,\r\n\r\n```\r\nIt returns -1, 0, or 1 as the first element is less than, equal to, or greater than\r\nthe second element. If the comparator function returns other\r\nvalues (including null), the function will fail and raise an error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's fine to return non -1, 0, 1 integers to follow the Java convention (still need to update the doc, though), but it should throw an exception for `null` result.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, if a user uses a comparator that returns `null`, it will throw an error after this PR.\r\n\r\nThe legacy flag `spark.sql.legacy.allowNullComparisonResultInArraySort` can be used to restore the legacy behavior that handles `null` as `0` (equal).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded some tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-10T18:24:32Z","updated_at":"2022-06-10T23:50:43Z","closed_at":"2022-06-10T23:50:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdcd1e5ffb3debf5f784b9f740c86e5c5c86dbe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dca12d430fbf6f86ddd776f5b85b3bfc89f70e74","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-39419/3.2/array_sort","ref":"issues/SPARK-39419/3.2/array_sort","sha":"dca12d430fbf6f86ddd776f5b85b3bfc89f70e74","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport of #36812.\r\n\r\nFixes `ArraySort` to throw an exception when the comparator returns `null`.\r\n\r\nAlso updates the doc to follow the corrected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen the comparator of `ArraySort` returns `null`, currently it handles it as `0` (equal).\r\n\r\nAccording to the doc,\r\n\r\n```\r\nIt returns -1, 0, or 1 as the first element is less than, equal to, or greater than\r\nthe second element. If the comparator function returns other\r\nvalues (including null), the function will fail and raise an error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's fine to return non -1, 0, 1 integers to follow the Java convention (still need to update the doc, though), but it should throw an exception for `null` result.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, if a user uses a comparator that returns `null`, it will throw an error after this PR.\r\n\r\nThe legacy flag `spark.sql.legacy.allowNullComparisonResultInArraySort` can be used to restore the legacy behavior that handles `null` as `0` (equal).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded some tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-10T18:21:23Z","updated_at":"2022-06-10T23:49:52Z","closed_at":"2022-06-10T23:49:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06178c8fc43edb9f4d9445d1c1662154dc6d2098","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36834/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36834/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36834/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4f41230740aae3c55e1cbc4ff429d022b4df1174","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-39419/3.3/array_sort","ref":"issues/SPARK-39419/3.3/array_sort","sha":"4f41230740aae3c55e1cbc4ff429d022b4df1174","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is the modified version of #36483\r\n\r\nPropagateEmptyRelation can simplify Join. For example, if the right side of LEFT JOIN is empty, then it can eliminate join to its left side.\r\n\r\nIf there is a shuffle on the left side, it can be considered that the shuffle is meaningless, and the shuffle can be optimized by using LocalRead.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM testData LEFT JOIN testData2 ON key = a and a > 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this pr:\r\n```tex\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=true\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   *(3) Project [key#13, value#14, cast(null as int) AS a#23, cast(null as int) AS b#24]\r\n   +- AQEShuffleRead coalesced\r\n      +- ShuffleQueryStage 0\r\n         +- Exchange hashpartitioning(key#13, 5), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS_MEANINGLESS, [id=#107]\r\n            +- *(1) SerializeFromObject

pr:\r\n```tex\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=true\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   *(3) Project [key#13, value#14, cast(null as int) AS a#23, cast(null as int) AS b#24]\r\n   +- AQEShuffleRead local\r\n

changes needed?\r\nAvoid remote shuffle read and improve efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a threshold to not in line CTE if the CTE is referenced at least this threshold and `spark.sql.exchange.reuse` is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. In some cases, the CTE can be heavy and referenced many times(The most I have seen is 39 times). Not in line CTE can reduce a lot of duplicate work. For example, scan this big table with a very heavy UDF:\r\n    <img width=\"751\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5399861/173006180-4b8a29f5-6ce9-408f-a940-a9ca5f3fba1e.png\">\r\n2. It can reduce the number of table scans and reduce the pressure on Namenode. Especially for tables with many small files.\r\n\r\n3. Hive has a similar implementation: HIVE-11752\r\n\r\n\r\nBut not in line CTE does not always get benefit. Such as TPC-DS q4.\r\n<img width=\"751\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5399861/173007436-2e57e46f-cb39-48e6-8379-8032ca4cdf46.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update `PySpark dependencies` section in Installation document.\r\n- https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/spark/v3.3.0-rc5-docs/_site/api/python/getting_started/install.html#dependencies\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark 3.3 requires `numpy` 1.15.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8765eea1c08bc58a0cfc22b7cfbc0b5645cc81f9/python/setup.py#L270-L274\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8765eea1c08bc58a0cfc22b7cfbc0b5645cc81f9/python/setup.py#L264-L265\r\n\r\nSo,\r\n- We need to update `numpy` to 1.15 from 1.14 accordingly in documentation.\r\n- We had better remove the duplicated NumPy packages (with two versions) because both `MLlib` and `pandas API on Spark` requires the same version.\r\n- We should use package names consistently.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is a doc-only change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

needed?\r\n\r\nAt the moment timestamp functions like now() can return different values within a query if subqueries are involved\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to don't support ANSI intervals by the percentile functions, and remove the YearMonthIntervalType and DayTimeIntervalType types from the list of input types. I propose to properly support ANSI intervals and enable them back after that.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo don't confuse users by results of the percentile functions when inputs are ANSI intervals. At the moment, the functions return DOUBLE (or ARRAY OF DOUBLE) type independently from inputs. In the case of ANSI intervals, the functions should return ANSI interval too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, since the functions haven't released yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.ExpressionInfoSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *ExpressionsSchemaSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *PercentileSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *PercentileQuerySuite\"\r\n```\r\nand checked manually that ANSI intervals are not supported as input types:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT percentile(col, 0.5) FROM VALUES (INTERVAL '0' MONTH), (INTERVAL '10' MONTH) AS tab(col);\r\nError in query: cannot resolve 'percentile(tab.col, CAST(0.5BD AS DOUBLE), 1L)' due to data type mismatch: argument 1 requires numeric type, however, 'tab.col' is of interval month type.; line 1 pos 7;\r\n```","created_at":"2022-06-09T07:41:26Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T09:03:57Z","closed_at":"2022-06-09T12:24:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b217e58c57941755799b56b643b33517850d557","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36817/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36817/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36817/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e65d7103ba745630496d47c25961d0e7ff3a662","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:percentile-disable-ansi-interval","ref":"percentile-disable-ansi-interval","sha":"0e65d7103ba745630496d47c25961d0e7ff3a662","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

Negative arguments now work correctly and result in ranges relative to the end and start of each group, Previously, negative arguments returned empty frames.\r\n\r\n* SPARK-39317 https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36699 In Spark 3.4, the infer schema process of `groupby.apply` in Pandas on Spark, will first infer the pandas type to ensure the accuracy of the pandas `dtype` as much as possible.\r\n\r\n* SPARK-39314 https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36711 In Spark 3.4, the `Series.concat` sort parameter will be respected to follow pandas 1.4 behaviors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor other test only fixes, I don't add migration doc: SPARK-38821 SPARK-39053 SPARK-38982\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the error message that is thrown when trying to run `SHOW CREATE TABLE` on a Hive table with an unsupported serde. Currently this results in an error like\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Failed to execute SHOW CREATE TABLE against table rcFileTable, which is created by Hive and uses the following unsupported serde configuration\r\n SERDE: org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.columnar.LazyBinaryColumnarSerDe INPUTFORMAT: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.RCFileInputFormat OUTPUTFORMAT: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.RCFileOutputFormat \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch improves this error message by adding a suggestion to use `SHOW CREATE TABLE ... AS SERDE`:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Failed to execute SHOW CREATE TABLE against table rcFileTable, which is created by Hive and uses the following unsupported serde configuration\r\n SERDE: org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.columnar.LazyBinaryColumnarSerDe INPUTFORMAT: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.RCFileInputFormat OUTPUTFORMAT: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.RCFileOutputFormat\r\nPlease use `SHOW CREATE TABLE rcFileTable AS SERDE` to show Hive DDL instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe suggestion's wording is consistent with other error messages thrown by SHOW CREATE TABLE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe existing error message is confusing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it improves a user-facing error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE rcFileTable(i INT)\r\n    ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.columnar.LazyBinaryColumnarSerDe'\r\n    STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.RCFileInputFormat'\r\n              OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.RCFileOutputFormat'\r\n\r\nSHOW CREATE TABLE rcFileTable\r\n```\r\n\r\nto trigger the error. Confirmed that the `AS SERDE` suggestion actually works.","created_at":"2022-06-09T02:01:26Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T19:35:19Z","closed_at":"2022-06-09T19:35:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4354b5532514b440d25f6dbaf38ea6852e686b34","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f119f430e336b681e625f47dad29e305fe9c8065","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:suggest-show-create-table-as-serde-in-error-message","ref":"suggest-show-create-table-as-serde-in-error-message","sha":"f119f430e336b681e625f47dad29e305fe9c8065","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes `ArraySort` to throw an exception when the comparator returns `null`.\r\n\r\nAlso updates the doc to follow the corrected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen the comparator of `ArraySort` returns `null`, currently it handles it as `0` (equal).\r\n\r\nAccording to the doc, \r\n\r\n```\r\nIt returns -1, 0, or 1 as the first element is less than, equal to, or greater than\r\nthe second element. If the comparator function returns other\r\nvalues (including null), the function will fail and raise an error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's fine to return non -1, 0, 1 integers to follow the Java convention (still need to update the doc, though), but it should throw an exception for `null` result.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, if a user uses a comparator that returns `null`, it will throw an error after this PR.\r\n\r\nThe legacy flag `spark.sql.legacy.allowNullComparisonResultInArraySort` can be used to restore the legacy behavior that handles `null` as `0` (equal).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded some

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe should not try casting everything returned by `removeLeadingZerosFromNumberTypePartition` to string, as it returns null value for the cases when partition has null value and is already replaced by `DEFAULT_PARTITION_NAME`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nfor null partitions where `removeLeadingZerosFromNumberTypePartition` is called it would throw a NPE and hence the query would fail. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35404 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36746 , to simplify the error handling of `TempResolvedColumn`.\r\n\r\nThe idea is:\r\n1. The rule `ResolveAggregationFunctions` in the main resolution batch creates `TempResolvedColumn` and only removes it if the aggregate expression is fully resolved. It either strips `TempResolvedColumn` if it's inside aggregate function or group expression, or restores `TempResolvedColumn` to `UnresolvedAttribute` otherwise, hoping other rules can resolve it.\r\n2. The rule `RemoveTempResolvedColumn` in a latter batch can still hit `TempResolvedColumn` if the aggregate expression is unresolved (due to input type mismatch for example, e.g. `avg(bool_col)`, `date_add(int_group_col, 1)`). At this stage, there is no way to restore `TempResolvedColumn` to `UnresolvedAttribute`  and resolve it differently. The query will fail and we should blindly strip `TempResolvedColumn` to provide better error message.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode cleanup\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nStart `HadoopDelegationTokenManager` when `LocalSchedulerBackend` starts.\r\nThe behavior is similar to `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` startup, but it does not support local mode.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter[ SPARK-23639](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23639), we can use `spark-sql --master=local --proxy-user xxx` to proxy a user to access the hive meta store in the kerberos environment.\r\n\r\nBut `spark-submit` does not support accessing the hive meta store, we will get The following exception.\r\n `No valid credentials provided (Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos tgt)`\r\n\r\nAnd `spark-sql/spark-submit` will not automatically refresh the token or automatically relogin when using `--keytab`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWrite a simple spark to access the Hive metastore application in the kerberos environment, submit it through `spark-submit --proxy-user`, in this PR, it can work normally.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-08T13:51:44Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T15:26:48Z","closed_at":"2022-06-09T05:41:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2554a6e1b12208ca752fad768a88fb83618786fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36808/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36808/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36808/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c396118d3041c66373e1e49363f2a8520aecb042","head":{"label":"cxzl25:SPARK-39415","ref":"SPARK-39415","sha":"c396118d3041c66373e1e49363f2a8520aecb042","user":{"login":"cxzl25","id":3898450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25","html_url":"https://github.com/cxzl25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119043888,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwNDM4ODg=","name":"spark","full_name":"cxzl25/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cxzl25","id":3898450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTg0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3898450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25","html_url":"https://github.com/cxzl25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxzl25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cxzl25/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe added the support to query the `_metadata` column with a file-based streaming source: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35676. \r\n\r\nWe propose to use `transformUp` instead of `match` when pattern matching the `dataPlan` in `MicroBatchExecution` `runBatch` method in this PR. It is fine for `FileStreamSource` because `FileStreamSource` always returns one `LogicalRelation` node (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/FileStreamSource.scala#L247). \r\n\r\nBut the proposed change will make the logic robust and we really should not rely on the upstream source to return a desired plan. In addition, the proposed change could also make `_metadata` work if someone wants to customize `FileStreamSource` `getBatch`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRobust\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAccept NumPy array in createDataFrame, with existing dtypes support.\r\n\r\nNote that \r\n-  by the constraint of Spark DataFrame, we support 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional arrays only.\r\n- full NunPy <> PySpark mappings will be introduced as a follow-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs part of SPARK-39405 for NumPy support in SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, NumPy array is accepted in createDataFrame now:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]))\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Can not infer schema for type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>\r\n\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(np.array([0.1, 0.2]))\r\nTraceback

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTS in spark-env.sh.template\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark support using SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTS to pass properties to `spark-submit` and the command that depends on spark-submit(including `spark-shell`, `pyspark`, `run-example`, `sparkR`) but does not mention it in `spark-env.sh.template`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChange AliasAwareOutputExpression to using expression rather than attribute to track if we can nomalize. So the aliased expression can also preserve the output partitioning and ordering.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe will pull out complex keys from grouping expressions, so the project can hold a alias with expression. Unfortunately we may lose the output partitioning since the current AliasAwareOutputExpression only support preserve the alias with attribute.\r\n\r\nFor example, the follow query will introduce three exchanges instead of two.\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT c1 + 1, count(*)\r\nFROM t1\r\nJOIN t2 ON c1 + 1 = c2\r\nGROUP BY c1 + 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, improve performance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Spark version 3.1.0 and newer, Spark creates extra filter predicate conditions for repeated parquet columns.\r\nThese fields do not have the ability to have a filter predicate, according to the [PARQUET-34](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-34) issue in the parquet library.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves this problem until the appropriate functionality is provided by the parquet.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n\r\nAssume follow Protocol buffer schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmessage Model {\r\n    string name = 1;\r\n    repeated string keywords = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuppose a parquet file is created from a set of records in the above format with the help of the parquet-protobuf library.\r\nUsing Spark version 3.1.0 or newer, we get following exception when run the following query using spark-shell:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval data = spark.read.parquet(\"/path/to/parquet\")\r\ndata.registerTempTable(\"models\")\r\nspark.sql(\"select * from models where array_contains(keywords, 'X')\").show(false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: FilterPredicates do not currently support repeated columns. Column keywords is repeated.\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.filter2.predicate.SchemaCompatibilityValidator.validateColumn(SchemaCompatibilityValidator.java:176)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.filter2.predicate.SchemaCompatibilityValidator.validateColumnFilterPredicate(SchemaCompatibilityValidator.java:149)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.filter2.predicate.SchemaCompatibilityValidator.visit(SchemaCompatibilityValidator.java:89)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.filter2.predicate.SchemaCompatibilityValidator.visit(SchemaCompatibilityValidator.java:56)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.filter2.predicate.Operators$NotEq.accept(Operators.java:192)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.filter2.predicate.SchemaCompatibilityValidator.validate(SchemaCompatibilityValidator.java:61)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.filter2.compat.RowGroupFilter.visit(RowGroupFilter.java:95)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.filter2.compat.RowGroupFilter.visit(RowGroupFilter.java:45)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.filter2.compat.FilterCompat$FilterPredicateCompat.accept(FilterCompat.java:149)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.filter2.compat.RowGroupFilter.filterRowGroups(RowGroupFilter.java:72)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetFileReader.filterRowGroups(ParquetFileReader.java:870)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetFileReader.<init>(ParquetFileReader.java:789)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetFileReader.open(ParquetFileReader.java:657)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetRecordReader.initializeInternalReader(ParquetRecordReader.java:162)\r\n  at org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetRecordReader.initialize(ParquetRecordReader.java:140)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetFileFormat.$anonfun$buildReaderWithPartitionValues$2(ParquetFileFormat.scala:373)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileScanRDD$$anon$1.org$apache$spark$sql$execution$datasources$FileScanRDD$$anon$$readCurrentFile(FileScanRDD.scala:127)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe cause of the problem is due to a change in the data filtering conditions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"select * from log where array_contains(keywords, 'X')\").explain(true);\r\n\r\n// Spark 3.0.2 and older\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n... \r\n+- FileScan parquet [link#0,keywords#1]\r\n  DataFilters: [array_contains(keywords#1, Google)]\r\n  PushedFilters: []\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n// Spark 3.1.0 and newer\r\n== Physical Plan == ... \r\n+- FileScan parquet [link#0,keywords#1]\r\n  DataFilters: [isnotnull(keywords#1),  array_contains(keywords#1, Google)]\r\n  PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(keywords)]\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nPushing filters down for repeated columns of parquet is not necessary because it is not supported by parquet library for now. So we can exclude them from pushed predicate filters and solve issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPredicate filters that are pushed down to parquet should not be created on repeated-type fields.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, It's only fixed a bug and before this, due to the limitations of the parquet library, no more work was possible.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd an extra test to ensure problem solved.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-06T20:28:58Z","updated_at":"2022-06-08T21:35:16Z","closed_at":"2022-06-08T20:31:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a9068eeaa0b8fc8ed2cc4cdd7dd1e9f991fadab1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36781/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36781/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36781/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c06d8f7b677a8b3c1e2a25376235501e24ade794","head":{"label":"Borjianamin98:master","ref":"master","sha":"c06d8f7b677a8b3c1e2a25376235501e24ade794","user":{"login":"Borjianamin98","id":42433652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDMzNjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42433652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98","html_url":"https://github.com/Borjianamin98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":500501961,"node_id":"R_kgDOHdUNyQ","name":"spark","full_name":"Borjianamin98/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Borjianamin98","id":42433652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDMzNjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42433652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98","html_url":"https://github.com/Borjianamin98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Borjianamin98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Borjianamin98/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35768 assume the expression in `And`, `Or` and `Not` must be predicate.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36370 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36325 supported push down expressions in `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`. But the children of `And`, `Or` and `Not` can be `FieldReference.column(name)`.\r\n`FieldReference.column(name)` is not a predicate, so the assert may fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR fix the bug for `PushableColumnWithoutNestedColumn`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\nLet the push-down framework more correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nShould throw the error if caused by Filesystem closed when we enable ignoreCorruptFiles\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf we set ignoreCorruptFiles to true, when some executors are preempted, the driver will stop these executors, which might cause the filesystem closed exception. As ignoreCorruptFIles is enabled, some tasks will finish directly and return the results to the driver, and the driver will not reschedule these tasks if get the result, this could cause data loss.\r\nAs these files actually not corrupt files, so I think spark should handle this scenario.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->","created_at":"2022-06-06T10:21:05Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T00:23:07Z","closed_at":"2022-11-10T00:23:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d683729277c33c8dcfc884d2b69ebac913becb3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36775/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36775/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36775/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1ed21196c21a11ddda79045189976ade440c3c3c","head":{"label":"boneanxs:SPARK-39389","ref":"SPARK-39389","sha":"1ed21196c21a11ddda79045189976ade440c3c3c","user":{"login":"boneanxs","id":10115332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTE1MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10115332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs","html_url":"https://github.com/boneanxs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":500381013,"node_id":"R_kgDOHdM1VQ","name":"spark","full_name":"boneanxs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"boneanxs","id":10115332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTE1MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10115332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs","html_url":"https://github.com/boneanxs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boneanxs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/boneanxs/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`OrcUtils.readCatalystSchema` method will trigger a file IO to read `orcSchema` when Orc pushes down predicates.\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-37463:\r\n\r\n-  For `OrcFileFormat`, we can reuse [a read `orcSchema`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/cc0bf563b8caea21da5692f05e34b5f77e002ab9/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/orc/OrcFileFormat.scala#L146) to save this file read IO when Orc pushes down predicates\r\n\r\n- For `OrcPartitionReaderFactory`  we can achieve the same goal by moving `OrcFile.createReader` before `pushDownPredicates`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are

replaced to other expression in runtime, This PR will only translate `REGR_INTERCEPT`, `REGR_R2`, `REGR_SLOPE`, `REGR_SXY` for pushdown.\r\n\r\nAfter this job, users could override

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen task status is failed and `executorRunTime` has no value, try to use `duration`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the executor is lost due to OOM or other reasons, the metrics of these failed tasks do not `have executorRunTime`, which results in that the duration cannot be displayed in the UI.\r\nSometimes it is not very intuitive to see how long this task runs before it fails.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIgnore the comment syntax in the dfs command when Spark SQL splits semicolons.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn version 3.2, Spark SQL ignores semicolons in comment syntax when splitting input lines. \r\n\r\nThis behavior throws an unexpected dfs command error:\r\n\r\n(Related PR: SPARK-33100 SPARK-30049)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir testDfsCommand\r\necho 'abc' > testDfsCommand/a---.txt\r\n\r\n./spark-2.4.8-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-sql -e 'dfs -cat testDfsCommand/a---.txt;'\r\n#

testDfsCommand/*;'\r\n# cat: `testDfsCommand/*;': No such file or directory\r\n# Command -cat testDfsCommand/*; failed with exit code = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce *any* user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nBecause the implementation of the dfs command always does not support comment syntax, I don't think this PR will cause compatibility issues with legacy SQL.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-04T19:50:44Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T00:30:55Z","closed_at":"2022-10-18T00:30:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"abe97667d255b3b764a787f5bffe647953134fc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36768/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36768/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36768/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49c34c7ed9f2e0555b677ba31de4079c159fcc64","head":{"label":"izchen:split_dfs_command","ref":"split_dfs_command","sha":"49c34c7ed9f2e0555b677ba31de4079c159fcc64","user":{"login":"izchen","id":67534059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTM0MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67534059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen","html_url":"https://github.com/izchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":277137796,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzcxMzc3OTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"izchen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"izchen","id":67534059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTM0MDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67534059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen","html_url":"https://github.com/izchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/izchen/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to #36654. That PR modified the existing `QueryPlan.transformDownWithSubqueries` to add additional arguments for tree pattern pruning.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I roll back the change to that method's signature and instead add a new `transformDownWithSubqueriesAndPruning` method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe original change breaks binary and source compatibility in Catalyst. Technically speaking, Catalyst APIs are considered internal to Spark and are subject to change between minor releases (see [source](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bb51add5c79558df863d37965603387d40cc4387/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/package.scala#L20-L24)), but I think it's nice to try to avoid API breakage when possible.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to compile some custom Catalyst code, I ran into issues when trying to call the `transformDownWithSubqueries` method without supplying a tree pattern filter condition. If I do `transformDownWithSubqueries() { f } ` then I get a compilation error. I think this is due to the first parameter group containing all default parameters.\r\n\r\nMy PR's solution of adding a new `transformDownWithSubqueriesAndPruning` method solves this problem. It's also more consistent with the naming convention used for other pruning-enabled tree transformation methods.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it normalize expr ids in `ListQuery` and `Exists` expressions. For example:\r\n```scala\r\nval testRelation = LocalRelation($\"a\".int, $\"b\".int, $\"c\".int)\r\nval x = testRelation.as(\"x\")\r\nval y = testRelation.as(\"y\")\r\n\r\nval originalQuery = x.where($\"x.a\".in(ListQuery(y.select($\"b\")))).analyze\r\n\r\nprintln(Optimize.execute(normalizeExprIds(originalQuery)))\r\n```\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\nFilter a#0 IN (list#0 [])\r\n:  +- Project [b#15]\r\n:     +- SubqueryAlias y\r\n:        +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#14, b#15, c#16]\r\n+- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#0, c#0]               \r\n```\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n```\r\nFilter a#0 IN (list#0 [])\r\n:  +- Project [b#0]\r\n:     +- SubqueryAlias y\r\n:        +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#0, c#0]\r\n+- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#0, c#0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`PlanTestBase.comparePlans` fails in some cases because the expr id not equal.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFollows up from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31666. This PR introduced a bug where the qualified star expansion of a subquery alias containing a NATURAL/USING output duplicated columns.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDuplicated, hidden columns should not be output from a star expansion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe query\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df1 = Seq((3, 8)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\") \r\nval df2 = Seq((8, 7)).toDF(\"b\", \"d\") \r\nval joinDF = df1.join(df2, \"b\")\r\njoinDF.alias(\"r\").select(\"r.*\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow outputs a single column `b`, instead of two (duplicate) columns for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n\r\n- Updates AppVeyor to use the latest R version 4.2.0.\r\n- Uses the correct way of checking if an object is a matrix: `is.matrix`.\r\n    After R 4.2.0,  `class(upperBoundsOnCoefficients) != \"matrix\")` fails:\r\n    ```\r\n    -- 1. Error (test_mllib_classification.R:245:3): spark.logit -------------------\r\n    Error in `if (class(upperBoundsOnCoefficients) != \"matrix\") {\r\n        stop(\"upperBoundsOnCoefficients must be a matrix.\")\r\n    }`: the condition has length > 1\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This fixes `spark.logit` when `lowerBoundsOnCoefficients` or `upperBoundsOnCoefficients` is specified. \r\n\r\n- Explicitly use the first element in `is.na` comparison. From R 4.2.0, it throws an exception as below:\r\n    ```\r\n    Error in if (is.na(c(1, 2))) print(\"abc\") : the condition has length > 1\r\n    ```\r\n    Previously it was a warning.\r\n\r\n    This fixes `createDataFrame` or `as.DataFrame` when the data type is a nested complex type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support/test the latest R. R community tends to use the latest versions aggressively.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, after this PR, we officially support R 4.2.0 in SparkR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should test it

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR removes the unlocking of write locks on task end from the `BlockInfoManager`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `BlockInfoManager` releases all locks held by a task when the task is done. It also release write locks, the problem with that is that a thread (other than the main task thread) might still be modifying the block. By releasing it the block now seems readable, and a reader might observe a block in a partial or non-existent state.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35991.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests should pass. I can add a tests if folks are onboard with this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently for `ALTER DATABASE SET LOCATION` command, Spark will throw exception when Hive version (e.g., specified via `spark.sql.hive.metastore.version`) is not 3.0/3.1. This PR removes the check so that the command works as long as the Hive version used by the Hive metastore (which could be different from the version used by Spark) supports the alter database location feature added via [HIVE-8472](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-8472). If it does not support it, the same exception will still be thrown from Spark side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor the command `ALTER DATABASE SET LOCATION` command, Spark currently throws exception like the following:\r\n```\r\nAnalysisException: Hive 2.3.9 does not support altering database location\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not accurate since it only considers the client version, while the feature support is on the Hive metastore server side. Therefore, the command should succeed if Spark is using Hive 2.3 while the remote Hive megastore is using Hive 3.1. On the other hand, the command will not succeed if Spark is using Hive 3.1 (thus no exception) but the remote Hive metastore is using 2.3.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, previously Spark users using Hive client with version other than 3.0/3.1 won't be able to run `ALTER DATABASE SET LOCATION` command against Hive metastore 3.x. After this PR it should work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why
