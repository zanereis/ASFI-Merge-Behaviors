What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nKeeps K8s executor resources present if case of failure or normal termination.\r\nIntroduces a new boolean config option: `spark.kubernetes.deleteExecutors`, with default value set to true.\r\nThe idea is to update Spark K8s backend structures but leave the resources around.\r\nThe assumption is that since entries are not removed from the `removedExecutorsCache` we are immune to updates that refer to the the executor resources previously removed.\r\nThe only delete operation not touched is the one in the `doKillExecutors` method.\r\nReason is right now we dont support [blacklisting](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23485) and dynamic allocation with Spark on K8s. In both cases in the future we might want to handle these scenarios although its more complicated.\r\nMore tests can be added if approach is approved. \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually by running a Spark job and verifying pods are not deleted.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-25T20:50:40Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T04:10:16Z","closed_at":"2018-12-03T17:07:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a1bb2ad1d7efe3c98d9167f1eed5ff8088803ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23136/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23136/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23136/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6857f5eba6671016d7c2277902cb9f9488835565","head":{"label":"skonto:keep_pods","ref":"keep_pods","sha":"6857f5eba6671016d7c2277902cb9f9488835565","user":{"login":"skonto","id":7945591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7945591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto","html_url":"https://github.com/skonto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48892104,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODg5MjEwNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"skonto/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skonto","id":7945591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7945591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto","html_url":"https://github.com/skonto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skonto/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose using of the locale option to parse (and infer) decimals from JSON input. After the changes, `JacksonParser` converts input string to `BigDecimal` and to Spark's Decimal by using `java.text.DecimalFormat`. New behavior is enabled for locales different from `en-US`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded 2 tests to `JsonExpressionsSuite` for the `en-US`, `ko-KR`, `ru-RU`, `de-DE` locales: \r\n- Inferring decimal type using locale from JSON field values\r\n- Converting JSON field values to specified decimal type using the locales.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose filtering out all empty files inside of `FileSourceScanExec` and exclude them from file splits. It should reduce overhead of opening and reading files without any data, and as consequence datasources will not produce empty partitions for such files.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test which creates an empty and non-empty files. If empty files are ignored in load, Text datasource in the `wholetext` mode must create only one partition for non-empty

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplement codegen for `LocalTableScanExec` and `ExistingRDDExec`. Refactor to share code between `LocalTableScanExec`, `ExistingRDDExec`, `InputAdapter` and `RowDataSourceScanExec`.\r\n\r\nThe difference in `doProduce` between these four was that `ExistingRDDExec` and `RowDataSourceScanExec` triggered adding an `UnsafeProjection`, while `InputAdapter` and `LocalTableScanExec` did not.\r\n\r\nIn the new trait `InputRDDCodegen` I added a flag `createUnsafeProjection` which the operators set accordingly.\r\n\r\nNote: `LocalTableScanExec` explicitly creates its input as `UnsafeRows`, so it was obvious why it doesn't need an `UnsafeProjection`. But if an `InputAdapter` may take input that is `InternalRows` but not `UnsafeRows`, then I think it doesn't need an unsafe projection just because any other operator that is its parent would do that. That assumes that that any parent operator would always result in some `UnsafeProjection` being eventually added, and hence the output of the `WholeStageCodegen` unit would be `UnsafeRows`. If these assumptions hold, I think `createUnsafeProjection` could be set to `(parent == null)`.\r\n\r\nNote: Do not codegen `LocalTableScanExec` when it's the only operator. `LocalTableScanExec` has optimized driver-only `executeCollect` and `executeTake` code paths that are used to return `Command` results without starting Spark Jobs. They can no longer be used if the `LocalTableScanExec` gets optimized.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCovered and used in existing tests.","created_at":"2018-11-23T20:02:58Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T05:41:55Z","closed_at":"2018-11-28T05:41:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22b10af4e9f396ccffe0f6c0a24362acaa29736d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3668f97b8848d68d3c85a2478783f7b33d2134cc","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-26159","ref":"SPARK-26159","sha":"3668f97b8848d68d3c85a2478783f7b33d2134cc","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently duplicated map keys are not handled consistently. For example, map look up respects the duplicated key appears first, `Dataset.collect` only keeps the duplicated key appears last, `MapKeys` returns duplicated keys, etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove duplicated map keys with last wins policy, to follow Java/Scala and Presto. It only applies to built-in functions, as users can create map with duplicated map keys via private APIs anyway.\r\n\r\nupdated functions: `CreateMap`, `MapFromArrays`, `MapFromEntries`, `StringToMap`, `MapConcat`, `TransformKeys`.\r\n\r\nFor other places:\r\n1. data source v1 doesn't have this problem, as users need to provide a java/scala map, which can't have duplicated keys.\r\n2. data source v2 may have this problem. I've added a note to `ArrayBasedMapData` to ask the caller to take care of duplicated keys. In the future we should enforce it in the stable data APIs for data source v2.\r\n3. UDF doesn't have this problem, as users need to provide a java/scala map. Same as data source v1.\r\n4. file format. I checked all of them and only parquet does not enforce it. For backward compatibility reasons I change nothing but leave a note saying that the behavior will be undefined if users write map with duplicated keys to parquet files. Maybe we can add a config and fail by default if parquet files have map with duplicated keys. This can be done in followup.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nupdated tests and new tests\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-23T05:33:45Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T07:33:43Z","closed_at":"2018-11-28T15:47:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ed73b680624e548e163802fd1722f6f4e545f6c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23124/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23124/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23124/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/72c771e691ae1071742bde5a612593d38f147ff5","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:map","ref":"map","sha":"72c771e691ae1071742bde5a612593d38f147ff5","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change behaviour of `UnivocityParser` and `FailureSafeParser`, and return all fields that were parsed and converted to expected types successfully instead of just returning a row with all `null`s for a bad input in the `PERMISSIVE` mode. For example, for CSV line `0,2013-111-11 12:13:14` and DDL schema `a int, b timestamp`, new result is `Row(0, null)`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was checked by existing tests from `CsvSuite` and `CsvFunctionsSuite`.","created_at":"2018-11-22T21:56:19Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:10Z","closed_at":"2018-12-03T10:30:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02d0809daa5ecf282a49051d327eb91a0d301cd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e09d41704a3f0cd940a1334914f07f5d1794a5d1","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:failuresafe-partial-result","ref":"failuresafe-partial-result","sha":"e09d41704a3f0cd940a1334914f07f5d1794a5d1","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nFor the current status, the test script that generates coverage information was merged\r\ninto Spark, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20204\r\n\r\nSo, we can generate the coverage report and site by, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun-tests-with-coverage --python-executables=python3 --modules=pyspark-sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nlike `run-tests` script in `./python`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed change\r\n\r\nThe next step is to host this coverage report via `github.io` automatically\r\nby Jenkins (see https://spark-test.github.io/pyspark-coverage-site/).\r\n\r\nThis uses my testing account for Spark, @spark-test, which is shared to Felix and Shivaram a long time ago for testing purpose including AppVeyor.\r\n\r\nTo cut this short, this PR targets to run the coverage in \r\n[spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7/)\r\n\r\nIn the specific job, it will clone the page, and rebase the up-to-date PySpark test coverage from the latest commit. For instance as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Clone PySpark coverage site.\r\ngit clone https://github.com/spark-test/pyspark-coverage-site.git\r\n\r\n# Remove existing HTMLs.\r\nrm -fr pyspark-coverage-site/*\r\n\r\n# Copy generated coverage HTMLs.\r\ncp -r .../python/test_coverage/htmlcov/* pyspark-coverage-site/\r\n\r\n# Check out to a temporary branch.\r\ngit symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/latest_branch\r\n\r\n# Add all the files.\r\ngit add -A\r\n\r\n# Commit current HTMLs.\r\ngit commit -am \"Coverage report at latest commit in Apache Spark\"\r\n\r\n# Delete the old branch.\r\ngit branch -D gh-pages\r\n\r\n# Rename the temporary branch to master.\r\ngit branch -m gh-pages\r\n\r\n# Finally, force update to our repository.\r\ngit push -f origin gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, it is a one single up-to-date coverage can be shown in the `github-io` page. The commands above were manually tested.\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\n\r\n- [x] Write a draft @HyukjinKwon \r\n- [x] `pip install coverage` to all python implementations (pypy, python2, python3) in Jenkins workers  - @shaneknapp \r\n- [x] Set hidden `SPARK_TEST_KEY` for @spark-test's password in Jenkins via Jenkins's feature\r\n This should be set in both PR builder and `spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7` so that later other PRs can test and fix the bugs - @shaneknapp \r\n- [x] Set an environment variable that indicates `spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7` so that that specific build can report and update the coverage site - @shaneknapp \r\n- [x] Make PR builder's test passed @HyukjinKwon \r\n- [x] Fix flaky test related with coverage @HyukjinKwon \r\n  -  6 consecutive passes out of 7 runs\r\n\r\nThis PR will be co-authored with me and @shaneknapp \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt will be tested via Jenkins.","created_at":"2018-11-22T08:26:41Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T07:22:27Z","closed_at":"2019-02-01T02:21:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f354f40ed4ee04f11ac3934251c971acd8cb2f7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23117/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23117/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23117/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/426ef1182dffb3bd01561af7d714d8ce3bb6ddde","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-7721","ref":"SPARK-7721","sha":"426ef1182dffb3bd01561af7d714d8ce3bb6ddde","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch defines an internal Spark interface for reporting shuffle metrics and uses that in shuffle reader. Before this patch, shuffle metrics is tied to a specific implementation (using a thread local temporary data structure and accumulators). After this patch, callers that define their own shuffle RDDs can create a custom metrics implementation.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, we would be able to create a better metrics for the SQL layer, e.g. reporting shuffle metrics in the SQL UI, for each exchange operator.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm separating read side and write side implementations, as they are very different, to simplify code review. Write side change is at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23106\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNo behavior change expected, as it is a straightforward refactoring. Updated all existing test cases.","created_at":"2018-11-21T14:59:53Z","updated_at":"2018-11-24T08:45:39Z","closed_at":"2018-11-23T22:18:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54cba51de4de59b0a625816c1598e58e35b15b16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23105/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23105/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23105/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a5ce2475936f4109a566407330feb9e9635f601","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-26140","ref":"SPARK-26140","sha":"1a5ce2475936f4109a566407330feb9e9635f601","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have deprecated `OneHotEncoder` at Spark 2.3.0 and introduced `OneHotEncoderEstimator`. At 3.0.0, we remove deprecated `OneHotEncoder` and rename `OneHotEncoderEstimator` to `OneHotEncoder`.\r\n\r\nTODO: According to ML migration guide, we need to keep `OneHotEncoderEstimator` as an alias after renaming. This is not done at this patch in order to facilitate review.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe explicitly avoid files with hdfs erasure coding for the streaming WAL\r\nand for event logs, as hdfs EC does not support all relevant apis.\r\nHowever, the new builder api used has different semantics -- it does not\r\ncreate parent dirs, and it does not resolve relative paths.  This\r\nupdates createNonEcFile to have similar semantics to the old api.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan tests with the WAL pointed at a non-existent dir, which failed before this change.  Manually tested the new function with a relative path as well.\r\nUnit tests via jenkins.","created_at":"2018-11-19T22:43:59Z","updated_at":"2018-12-04T22:39:23Z","closed_at":"2018-12-04T22:39:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dcdfb133412fa29d9d035ffc3044bf1082109057","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23092/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23092/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23092/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/891e37cd371350906035cfbf93c618035a4293b1","head":{"label":"squito:SPARK-26094","ref":"SPARK-26094","sha":"891e37cd371350906035cfbf93c618035a4293b1","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to pass the CSV option `encoding`/`charset` to `uniVocity` parser to allow parsing CSV files in different encodings when `multiLine` is enabled. The value of the option is passed to the `beginParsing` method of `CSVParser`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test to `CSVSuite` for different encodings and enabled/disabled

[proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uUmKCpWLdh9vHxP7AWJ9EgbwB_U6T3EJYNjhISGmiQg/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nIt adds the new API for batch read, without removing the old APIs, as they are still needed for streaming sources.\r\n\r\nMore concretely, it adds\r\n1. `TableProvider`, works like an anonymous catalog\r\n2. `Table`, represents a structured data set.\r\n3. `ScanBuilder` and `Scan`, a logical represents of data source scan\r\n4. `Batch`, a physical representation of data source batch scan.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes [SPARK-26114](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26114) issue that occurs when trying to reduce the number of partitions by means of coalesce without shuffling after shuffle-based transformations. \r\n\r\nThe leak occurs because of not cleaning up `ExternalSorter`'s `readingIterator` field as it's done for its `map` and `buffer` fields.\r\nAdditionally there are changes to the `CompletionIterator` to prevent capturing its `sub`-iterator and holding it even after the completion iterator completes. It is necessary because in some cases, e.g. in case of standard scala's `flatMap` iterator (which is used is `CoalescedRDD`'s `compute` method) the next value of the main iterator is assigned to `flatMap`'s `cur` field only after it is available. \r\nFor DAGs where ShuffledRDD is a parent of CoalescedRDD it means that the data should be fetched from the map-side of the shuffle, but the process of fetching this data consumes quite a lot of memory in addition to the memory already consumed by the iterator held by `flatMap`'s `cur` field (until it is reassigned).\r\n\r\nFor the following data\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.io._ \r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.io.compress._ \r\nimport org.apache.commons.lang._ \r\nimport org.apache.spark._ \r\n\r\n// generate 100M records of sample data \r\nsc.makeRDD(1 to 1000, 1000) \r\n  .flatMap(item => (1 to 100000) \r\n    .map(i => new Text(RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(3).toLowerCase) -> new Text(RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(1024)))) \r\n  .saveAsSequenceFile(\"/tmp/random-strings\", Some(classOf[GzipCodec])) \r\n```\r\n\r\nand the following job\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.hadoop.io._\r\nimport org.apache.spark._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.storage._\r\n\r\nval rdd = sc.sequenceFile(\"/tmp/random-strings\", classOf[Text], classOf[Text])\r\nrdd \r\n  .map(item => item._1.toString -> item._2.toString) \r\n  .repartitionAndSortWithinPartitions(new HashPartitioner(1000)) \r\n  .coalesce(10,false) \r\n  .count \r\n```\r\n\r\n... executed like the following\r\n```bash\r\nspark-shell \\ \r\n  --num-executors=5 \\ \r\n  --executor-cores=2 \\ \r\n  --master=yarn \\\r\n  --deploy-mode=client \\ \r\n  --conf spark.executor.memoryOverhead=512 \\\r\n  --conf spark.executor.memory=1g \\ \r\n  --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=false \\\r\n  --conf spark.executor.extraJavaOptions='-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp -Dio.netty.noUnsafe=true'\r\n```\r\n\r\n... executors are always failing with OutOfMemoryErrors.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is multiple leaks of ExternalSorter references.\r\nFor example, in case of 2 tasks per executor it is expected to be 2 simultaneous instances of ExternalSorter per executor but heap dump generated on OutOfMemoryError shows that there are more ones.\r\n\r\n![run1-noparams-dominator-tree-externalsorter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1523889/48703665-782ce580-ec05-11e8-95a9-d6c94e8285ab.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. This PR does not cover cases with CoGroupedRDDs which use ExternalAppendOnlyMap internally, which itself can lead to OutOfMemoryErrors in many places. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Existing unit tests\r\n- New unit tests\r\n- Job executions on the live environment\r\n\r\nHere is the screenshot before applying this patch\r\n![run3-noparams-failure-ui-5x2-repartition-and-sort](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1523889/48700395-f769eb80-ebfc-11e8-831b-e94c757d416c.png)\r\n\r\nHere is the screenshot after

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTask summary table displays the summary of the task table in the stage page. However, the 'Duration' metrics of 'task summary' table and 'task table' are not matching. The reason is because, in the 'task summary' we display 'executorRunTime' as the duration, and in the 'task table' the actual duration of the task. Except duration metrics, all other metrics are properly displaying in the task summary.\r\n\r\nIn Spark2.2, used to show 'executorRunTime' as duration in the 'taskTable'. That is why, in summary metrics also the 'exeuctorRunTime' shows as the duration. So, we need to show 'executorRunTime' as the duration in the tasks table to follow the same behaviour as the previous versions of spark.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nBefore

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR,  I propose new options for CSV datasource - `lineSep` similar to Text and JSON datasource. The option allows to specify custom line separator of maximum length of 2 characters (because of a restriction in `uniVocity` parser). New option can be used in reading and writing CSV files.  \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a few tests with custom `lineSep` for enabled/disabled `multiLine` in read as well as tests in write. Also I added roundtrip tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-18T11:56:17Z","updated_at":"2021-02-25T19:28:55Z","closed_at":"2018-11-23T15:54:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7fd7d6f6e08df4ab0e95f74e155ac4c78dd1f414","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a4c4b6710cb67bddd9badbb53aa07b0d93242bc5","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:csv-line-sep","ref":"csv-line-sep","sha":"a4c4b6710cb67bddd9badbb53aa07b0d93242bc5","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, some of PySpark tests sill assume the tests could be ran in Python 2.6 by importing `unittest2`. For instance:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif sys.version_info[:2] <= (2, 6):\r\n    try:\r\n        import unittest2 as unittest\r\n    except ImportError:\r\n        sys.stderr.write('Please install unittest2 to test with Python 2.6 or earlier')\r\n        sys.exit(1)\r\nelse:\r\n    import unittest\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile I am here, I removed some of unused imports and reordered imports per PEP 8.\r\n\r\nWe officially dropped Python 2.6 support a while ago and started to discuss about Python 2 drop. It's better to remove them out. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tests, and existing tests via Jenkins.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-18T08:24:50Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:20:31Z","closed_at":"2018-11-19T01:27:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1c53cf9b66203b2a039167b32c62c1ac58336c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23077/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23077/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23077/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a1880767041b325e4343bd6a1737cdccfe614792","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-26105","ref":"SPARK-26105","sha":"a1880767041b325e4343bd6a1737cdccfe614792","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

query plans can get extremely large (hundreds of megabytes).\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR puts in a limit on the nesting depth of trees to be printed when writing a plan string.  \r\n* The default limit is 15, which allows for reasonably nested plans.  \r\n* A new configuration parameter called spark.debug.maxToStringTreeDepth was added to control the depth.\r\n* When plans are truncated, \"...\" is printed to indicate that tree elements were removed.\r\n* A warning is printed out the first time a truncated plan is displayed.  The warning explains what happened and how to adjust the limit.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit test in QueryExecutionSuite which creates a highly nested plan and then ensures that the printed plan is not too long.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-18T06:38:02Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T18:11:00Z","closed_at":"2018-11-28T18:11:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fabca22b86677bb91f434c25f35ac2cb5e90e2d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/42e4fcfb5678e83018013f7181c5bafc96c8136e","head":{"label":"DaveDeCaprio:max-log-tree-depth","ref":"max-log-tree-depth","sha":"42e4fcfb5678e83018013f7181c5bafc96c8136e","user":{"login":"DaveDeCaprio","id":841146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79563979,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTU2Mzk3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"DaveDeCaprio/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DaveDeCaprio","id":841146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/841146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio","html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaveDeCaprio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DaveDeCaprio/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an exception in `AggregateExpression.references` called on unresolved expressions. It implements the solution proposed in [SPARK-26084](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26084), a minor refactoring that removes the unnecessary dependence on `AttributeSet.toSeq`, which requires expression IDs and, therefore, can only execute successfully for resolved expressions.\r\n\r\nThe refactored implementation is both simpler and faster, eliminating the conversion of a `Set` to a\r\n`Seq` and back to `Set`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test based on the failing case in [SPARK-26084](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26084).\r\n\r\n@hvanhovell

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe corrupt column specified via JSON/CSV option *columnNameOfCorruptRecord* must have the `string` type and be `nullable`. This has been already checked in `DataFrameReader`.`csv`/`json` and in `Json`/`CsvFileFormat` but not in `from_json`/`from_csv`. The PR adds such checks inside functions as well.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests to `Json`/`CsvExpressionSuite` for checking type of the corrupt column. They don't check the `nullable` property because `schema` is forcibly casted to nullable.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis restores scaladoc artifact generation, which got dropped with the Scala 2.12 update. The change looks large, but is almost all due to needing to make the InterfaceStability annotations top-level classes (i.e. `@InterfaceStability.Stable` -> `@Stable`), unfortunately. A few inner class references had to be qualified too.\r\n\r\nLots of scaladoc warnings now reappear. We can choose to disable generation by default and enable for releases, later.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A; build runs scaladoc now.","created_at":"2018-11-17T11:26:19Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T02:23:18Z","closed_at":"2018-11-19T15:17:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c3d8dc37c63ce682a939207200ace9e1485a9f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/25a311beb9da709b61931dca12a7c443f43efa65","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-26026","ref":"SPARK-26026","sha":"25a311beb9da709b61931dca12a7c443f43efa65","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe build has a lot of deprecation warnings. Some are new in Scala 2.12 and Java 11. We've fixed some, but I wanted to take a pass at fixing lots of easy miscellaneous ones here.\r\n\r\nThey're too numerous and small to list here; see the pull request. Some highlights:\r\n\r\n- `@BeanInfo` is deprecated in 2.12, and BeanInfo classes are pretty ancient in Java. Instead, case classes can explicitly declare getters\r\n- Eta expansion of zero-arg methods; foo() becomes () => foo() in many cases\r\n- Floating-point Range is inexact and deprecated, like 0.0 to 100.0 by 1.0\r\n- finalize() is finally deprecated (just needs to be suppressed)\r\n- StageInfo.attempId was deprecated and easiest to remove here\r\n\r\nI'm not now going to touch some chunks of deprecation warnings:\r\n\r\n- Parquet deprecations\r\n- Hive deprecations (particularly serde2 classes)\r\n- Deprecations in generated code (mostly Thriftserver CLI)\r\n- ProcessingTime deprecations (we may need to revive this class as internal)\r\n- many MLlib deprecations because they concern methods that may be removed anyway\r\n- a few Kinesis deprecations I couldn't figure out\r\n- Mesos get/setRole, which I don't know well\r\n- Kafka/ZK deprecations (e.g. poll())\r\n- Kinesis\r\n- a few other ones that will probably resolve by deleting a deprecated method\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, including manual testing with the 2.11 build and Java 11.","created_at":"2018-11-17T02:52:36Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T13:15:51Z","closed_at":"2018-11-20T00:27:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cfede8808a89df039d2c2872d9b2dfc61355b92e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23065/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23065/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23065/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0cfcd9056f4d93dfdeb447110e5e26030ad4ad3a","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-26090","ref":"SPARK-26090","sha":"0cfcd9056f4d93dfdeb447110e5e26030ad4ad3a","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change fixes a particular scenario where default spark SQL can't encode (thrift) types that are generated by twitter scrooge. These types are a trait that extends `scala.ProductX` with a constructor defined only in a companion object, rather than a actual case class. The actual case class used is child class, but that type is almost never referred to in code. The type has no corresponding constructor symbol and causes an exception. For all other purposes, these classes act just like case classes, so it is unfortunate that spark SQL can't serialize them nicely as it can actual case classes. For an full example of a scrooge codegen class, see https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ba13d4b612396ca72725eaa989900314.\r\n\r\nThis change catches the case where the type has no constructor but does have an `apply` method on the type's companion object. This allows for thrift types to be serialized/deserialized with implicit encoders the same way as normal case classes. This fix had to be done in three places where the constructor is assumed to be an actual constructor:\r\n\r\n1) In serializing, determining the schema for the dataframe relies on inspecting its constructor (`ScalaReflection.constructParams`). Here we fall back to using the companion constructor arguments.\r\n2) In deserializing or evaluating, in the java codegen ( `NewInstance.doGenCode`), the type couldn't be constructed with the new keyword. If there is no constructor, we change the constructor call to try the companion constructor.\r\n3)  In deserializing or evaluating, without codegen, the constructor is directly invoked (`NewInstance.constructor`). This was fixed with scala reflection to get the actual companion apply method.\r\n\r\nThe return type of `findConstructor` was changed because the companion apply method constructor can't be represented as a `java.lang.reflect.Constructor`.\r\n\r\nThere might be situations in which this approach would also fail in a new way, but it does at a minimum work for the specific scrooge example and will not impact cases that were already succeeding prior to this change\r\n\r\nNote: this fix does not enable using scrooge thrift enums, additional work for this is necessary. With this patch, it seems like you could patch `com.twitter.scrooge.ThriftEnum` to extend `_root_.scala.Product1[Int]` with `def _1 = value` to get spark's implicit encoders to handle enums, but I've yet to use this method myself.\r\n\r\nNote: I previously opened a PR for this issue, but only was able to fix case 1) there: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18766\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI've fixed all 3 cases and added two tests that use a case class that is similar to scrooge generated one. The test in ScalaReflectionSuite checks 1), and the additional asserting in ObjectExpressionsSuite checks 2) and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `BlockManager`, `getRemoteValues` gets a `ChunkedByteBuffer` (by calling `getRemoteBytes`) and creates an `InputStream` from it. `getRemoteBytes`, in turn, gets a `ManagedBuffer` and converts it to a `ChunkedByteBuffer`.\r\nInstead, expose a `getRemoteManagedBuffer` method so `getRemoteValues` can just get this `ManagedBuffer` and use its `InputStream`.\r\nWhen reading a remote cache block from disk, this reduces heap memory usage significantly.\r\nRetain `getRemoteBytes` for other callers.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nImran Rashid wrote an application (https://github.com/squito/spark_2gb_test/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/cloudera/sparktest/LargeBlocks.scala), that among other things, tests reading remote cache blocks. I ran this application, using 2500MB blocks, to test reading a cache block on disk. Without this change, with `--executor-memory 5g`, the test fails with `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`. With the change, the test passes with `--executor-memory 2g`.\r\nI also ran the unit tests in core. In particular, `DistributedSuite` has a set of tests that exercise the `getRemoteValues` code path. `BlockManagerSuite` has several tests that call `getRemoteBytes`; I left these unchanged, so `getRemoteBytes` still gets

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR breaks down the large mllib/tests.py file that contains all Python MLlib unit tests into several smaller test files to be easier to read and maintain.\r\n\r\nThe tests are broken down as follows:\r\n```\r\npyspark\r\n├── __init__.py\r\n...\r\n├── mllib\r\n│   ├── __init__.py\r\n...\r\n│   ├── tests\r\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_algorithms.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_feature.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_linalg.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_stat.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_streaming_algorithms.py\r\n│   │   └── test_util.py\r\n...\r\n├── testing\r\n...\r\n│   ├── mllibutils.py\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan tests manually by module to ensure test count was the same, and ran `python/run-tests --modules=pyspark-mllib` to verify all passing with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6. Also installed scipy to include optional tests in test_linalg.","created_at":"2018-11-16T03:09:37Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T05:45:33Z","closed_at":"2018-11-16T16:16:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a897728e5f1f8090d55d95d28a77cb5e569536f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23056/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23056/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23056/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2759521df7f2dffc9ddb9379e0b1dac6721da366","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:python-test-breakup-mllib-SPARK-26034","ref":"python-test-breakup-mllib-SPARK-26034","sha":"2759521df7f2dffc9ddb9379e0b1dac6721da366","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to postpone creation of `OutputStream`/`Univocity`/`JacksonGenerator` till the first row should be written. This prevents creation of empty files for empty partitions. So, no need to open and to read such files back while loading data from the location.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests for Text, JSON and CSV datasource where empty dataset is written but should not produce any files.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-15T21:14:01Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:08Z","closed_at":"2018-11-29T16:36:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a41e7022b4e407de0f60d543b9959c453fa3791e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23052/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23052/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23052/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/083d411ec1822986dbb82fbe1896a6c0d846c7d8","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:text-empty-files","ref":"text-empty-files","sha":"083d411ec1822986dbb82fbe1896a6c0d846c7d8","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd QueryStage and the framework for adaptive execution.\r\n\r\nThe main benefit from this PR is that the reducer count is set automatically based on a target file size.\r\n\r\nWe got this PR (branch ae-02) from https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/spark-adaptive/pull/43, which is based on branch ae-01, but I decided to not merge those in because they require invasive changes to spark-core, and a protocol change to the external shuffle service.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be relatively safe to merge because most of the code changes are to adaptive query execution, which isn't turned on by default.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-15T21:04:08Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T21:04:17Z","closed_at":"2018-11-15T21:04:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8868d6d71efbc7be61c62ebce9d8a7ce0fdab7a9","head":{"label":"palantir:juang/cherry-pick-ae-02","ref":"juang/cherry-pick-ae-02","sha":"8868d6d71efbc7be61c62ebce9d8a7ce0fdab7a9","user":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30919203,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDkxOTIwMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"palantir/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"palantir","id":303157,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwMzE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir","html_url":"https://github.com/palantir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palantir/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/palantir/spark","description":"Palantir

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen I try to run scripts (e.g. `start-master.sh`/`start-history-server.sh ` in latest master, I got such error:\r\n```\r\nPresence of build for multiple Scala versions detected.\r\nEither clean one of them or, export SPARK_SCALA_VERSION in spark-env.sh.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error message is quite confusing. Without reading `load-spark-env.sh`,  I didn't know which directory to remove, or where to find and edit the `spark-evn.sh`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to make the error message more clear. Also change the script for less maintenance when we add or drop Scala versions in the future.\r\nAs now with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22967, we can revise the error message as following(in my local setup):\r\n\r\n```\r\nPresence of build for multiple Scala versions detected (/Users/gengliangwang/IdeaProjects/spark/assembly/target/scala-2.12 and /Users/gengliangwang/IdeaProjects/spark/assembly/target/scala-2.11).\r\nRemove one of them or, export SPARK_SCALA_VERSION=2.12 in /Users/gengliangwang/IdeaProjects/spark/conf/spark-env.sh.\r\nVisit https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#environment-variables for more details about setting environment variables in spark-env.sh.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously in from_avro/to_avro, we override the method `simpleString` and `sql` for the string output. However, the override only affects the alias naming:\r\n```\r\nProject [from_avro('col, \r\n...\r\n, (mode,PERMISSIVE)) AS from_avro(col, struct<col1:bigint,col2:double>, Map(mode -> PERMISSIVE))#11]\r\n```\r\nIt only makes the alias name quite long: `from_avro(col, struct<col1:bigint,col2:double>, Map(mode -> PERMISSIVE))`).\r\n\r\nWe should follow `from_csv`/`from_json` here, to override the method prettyName only, and we will get a clean alias name\r\n\r\n```\r\n... AS from_avro(col)#11\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDue to implementation limitation, currently Spark can't compare or do equality check between map types. As a result, map values can't appear in EQUAL or comparison expressions, can't be grouping key, etc.\r\n\r\nThe more important thing is, map loop up needs to do equality check of the map key, and thus can't support map as map key when looking up values from a map. Thus it's not useful to have map as map key.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to stop users from creating maps using map type as key. The list of expressions that are updated: `CreateMap`, `MapFromArrays`, `MapFromEntries`, `MapConcat`, `TransformKeys`. I manually checked all the places that create `MapType`, and came up with this list.\r\n\r\nNote that, maps with map type key still exist, via reading from parquet files, converting from scala/java map, etc. This PR is not to completely forbid map as map key, but to avoid creating it by Spark itself.\r\n\r\nMotivation: when I was trying to fix the duplicate key problem, I found it's impossible to do it with map type map key. I think it's reasonable to avoid map type map key for builtin functions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding another excpetion rule for a popular case where ID columns are saved as decimal(x,0) and are compared with same ID columns in other tables which are saved as strings:\r\n```\r\nselect '22222222222222222224' = 22222222222222222223BD -- returns true\r\n```\r\nthis causes a major bug when we join to tables if one is defined as decimal and the other as string. in current situation we get a mix of good and bad results. we would prefer not to get results at all.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded a unit tests and made some manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe test failure is because `assertErrorAndClosed` misses one possible error message: `java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException`. This happens when the second `uploadStream` is called after the channel has been closed. This can be reproduced by adding `Thread.sleep(1000)` below this line: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/03306a6df39c9fd6cb581401c13c4dfc6bbd632e/common/network-common/src/test/java/org/apache/spark/network/RpcIntegrationSuite.java#L217\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the above issue and also improves the test failure messages of `assertErrorAndClosed`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch
