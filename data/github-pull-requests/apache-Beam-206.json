Translate from proto to v1b3 instead of duplicating various logic, such as the CoGBK expansion.\r\n* Fixed some smaller issues: root computations under CoGBK, unique naming in Dataflow. \r\n* Add utilities for proto pipeline manipulations towards using the translation as a more general Dataflow proxy. This also cleans up the graph to proto translation.\r\n* Added more Go integration tests and fixed some issues.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

want to run a Beam job in my Spark cluster that uses the S3FileSystem. My Spark cluster is configured to require a proxy server with authentication in order to make outbound connections. A small change is required to enable ClientConfiguration to be added to the configuration to enable this.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to specify the four proxy related properties of

change does two things:\r\n\r\n1. It modifies the way that the Dataflow Runner transmits combines to\r\nDataflow so that it can support combiner lifting. This is done by, when\r\ntranslating CombineGroupedValues transforms, encoding the ID of the\r\nparent Combine Per Key transform as a Serialized Fn.\r\n\r\n2. This change also preemptively fixes an issue that occurs that would\r\ncause CombineGroupedValues with side inputs to get translated that way\r\nfor Combiner lifting, despite the parent transform being an anonymous\r\ncomposite transform, indicating that the CombineGroupedValues should\r\nbe translated as a ParDo. This is fixed by adjusting the PTransform\r\nOverrides in DataflowRunner slightly.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

BEAM-646 points out, some existing runners intercept pipeline.apply()\r\nand replaces transform during pipeline execution. To construct a\r\npipeline that can be executed by those runners, interactive runner need\r\nto go through the interception process when adding new transforms to the\r\npipeline (ReadCache and WriteCache).\r\n\r\nThis change could be removed once BEAM-646 is resolved.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

doesn't let us completely get rid of .withTemplateCompatiblity() - it's possible that someone runs a template job where BigQueryIO.read() is just one of the IOs and it's not templated; in that case, .withTemplateCompatibility() is still needed because it still runs repeatedly. But this PR does make BQIO.read() kinder on people who forget to use it in simple pipelines.\r\n\r\nR: @reuvenlax

PR move SQL and Nexmark to the new schema framework.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n   * SQL now works seamlessly on PCollection<UserType> as long as UserType has a schema (which is simple for POJOs and Java Beans)\r\n   * Row conversion for POJOs and Java Beans should be more efficient than the old version.\r\n   * We now fully recursive and array fields in POJOs and Java Beans; these did not work previously in SQL.\r\n   * A large amount of code is now deleted - InferredRowCoder, all the Nexmark ModelAdaptor code)\r\n\r\nNote: this can not be merged until schemas are enabled for all major runners (BEAM-4793). A PR is currently out for review to make schemas work for all runners except for the Gearpump runner.\r\n\r\nR: @apilloud

As of writing, there's only one such IO - HBaseIO.readAll() - but this enables writing more of them without being worried that people can't use them.\r\n\r\nThis does *not* yet necessarily make it possible to rewrite existing bounded IOs to be SDF-based rather than BoundedSource-based:\r\n\r\n* For those that support liquid sharding and are frequently used in production with Dataflow (file-based sources, Bigtable, HBase), rewriting them would require SDF to support it too, otherwise performance degradation will be too large.\r\n* For those that don't support liquid sharding but support size estimation or splitting into chunks of given size - actually these could probably be rewritten, implementing `@SplitRestriction` by splitting into chunks of some reasonable size computed from the size estimate: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/5886 is a pretty good example and may be good enough.\r\n\r\nR: @iemejia \r\nCC: @lukecwik @jbonofre @aljoscha @tweise

solves the problem where jars would overwrite each other when specifying -Ppublishing by fixing classifiers for shadowJar and jar to not conflict when publishing since jar by default uses null.\r\n\r\nNote that I also fixed:\r\n* some permissions issues of files\r\n* javadoc issues that came up when I was attempting to publish\r\n* the usage of :runners:google-cloud-dataflow-java:examples and examples-streaming. This was creating an empty project that was being published which was causing issues when attempting to perform a release.\r\n\r\nI was able to run a publishToMavenJavaPublicationToMavenLocal in parallel but didn't explicitly enable all the publishing plugins and remove the need for -Ppublishing because I didn't get enough time to test it. This cut publishing time down to about 8 mins from over 20 mins in a clean workspace on my machine.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

Simplify unbounded limit by reusing code with best of effort. Remove extra defined DoFn, class and enum, and reuse `Collector`. \r\n2. Make unbounded limit more compatible with distributed runners. In distributed runners, the shared in-memory queue will be replaced by a shared message queue (e.g. Google Cloud Pubsub). Therefore, it makes more sense to monitor the size of in-memory queue and in the future the size of shared message queue when running in distributed runner.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

pull request finishes the preparation of the io subpackage for Python 3 support. The work for io was started in #5715, however the py27-lint3 test was missing in tox.ini, resulting in some open issues and missing checks for new PRs.\r\n\r\nThe PR is part of a series in which all subpackages will be updated using the same approach.\r\nThis approach has been documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xDG0MWVlDKDPu_IW9gtMvxi2S9I0GB0VDTkPhjXT0nE/edit) and the first pull request in the series (Futurize coders subpackage) demonstrating this approach can be found at #5053.\r\n\r\nR: @aaltay @tvalentyn @RobbeSneyders @charlesccychen @superbobry\r\n\r\nPost-Commit
