makes `TestPipeline` implement a JUnit5 extension, making it usable with the JUnit5 extensions mechanism (what used to be \"Rules\" in JUnit4). \r\n\r\nIt's semantically the same code, the only outward noticeable change would be JUnit5 uses `@Tag` instead of `@Category`, and they're string values not classes, so `@Category(NeedsRunner.class)` becomes `@Tag(\"needsRunner\")` -- open to guidance on the value here, happy to consider the existing one a placeholder.\r\n\r\nThis also adds a separate JUnit5 test for the capablities of `TestPipeline` and a JUnit5 run in the `build.gradle`. It should be fine running side-by-side (both in theory and at least my experience) since they use different annotations etc., JUnit5 will only pick up the Jupiter annotations and JUnit4 will only use the `org.junit` ones.\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

_bug_ and it should be eliminated.\r\n\r\nSee next [user@ thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r7220ad2732e3d93e23e1f8af8051c5f6f6d72efdf556a467b9afb9fc%40%3Cuser.beam.apache.org%3E) where no one responded. Perhaps because it is complex and esoteric.\r\n\r\nImportant points to consider about this change, worth repeating in the PR:\r\n- the method is annotated \"experimental\" but it has been around since the very early days of Beam so we should ignore that\r\n- it was added as response to a _real user problem_: sliding windows + `EARLIEST` timestamp combiner delays downstream aggregations a lot\r\n- but when that problem occurred, timestamp combiner `EARLIEST` was the default; with the change to how lateness is defined we changed the default to `END_OF_WINDOW`\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR in a series of PRs to add sources and sinks for Google Cloud Firestore.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a sink for writing Documents to Cloud Firestore. This PR also \r\nincludes common code that is shared between the sources and Firestore SDK \r\nadapter which will be added in follow up PRs. (If desired I can split the common\r\ncode into a separate PR, but I thought it wouldn't make much sense without the \r\ncontext of it being used).\r\n\r\nEach commit has a detailed commit message, however a brief summary of the 4 \r\ncommits included in this PR are as follows:\r\n\r\n### Gradle \r\nAdd Google Cloud Firestore dependencies. Version 2.2.4+ is needed for all dependencies\r\nwhich include bugfixes and the necessary grpc client, protos and bootstraping\r\ncode.\r\n\r\n### Common Classes\r\nA set of base classes which underpin the added PTransforms and DoFns that will\r\nmake up the connector. This change also includes the base classes used in the\r\nunit and integration test suites which are present for each component of the\r\nconnector.\r\n\r\n### RPC QoS Classes\r\nAll read and write RPC Operations are managed in coordination with the RPC QoS\r\nlayer. Attempt counts, backoff amounts, batch sizing, success, failure metrics,\r\nthrottling are all managed here.\r\n\r\n### Firestore v1 Write Operations\r\nAdd PTransforms for writing to Cloud Firestore via the BatchWrite API. There are\r\ntwo implementations which only differ in what happens when an error is \r\nencountered. The first implementation will throw an exception if an error is \r\nencountered, whereas the second implementation will output a failure object \r\n(functioning similar to a dead letter queue).\r\n\r\n## Integration Tests\r\nThe integration test suite will only run if `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or\r\n`FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` are present in the environment. The project the tests\r\nrun against must have a [Firestore in Native mode](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/firestore-or-datastore#in_native_mode)\r\ndatabase configured (Firestore in Native Mode and Firestore in Datastore Mode cannot\r\nboth be present in the same project at this time). All integration tests are self\r\ncontained and do not depend on preconfigured external state, and clean up after\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nA future PR will be created for sources, and another PR for a Firestore SDK\r\nadapter which both will leverage the common code added in this PR.\r\n\r\n## Reviewers\r\n\r\nR: @chamikaramj\r\nR: @jlara310 (Firestore Technical Writer)\r\nR: @clement (Firestore Dataplane TL)\r\nR: @danthev (Firestore SRE)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds a new test to run all NDFrame doctests. Several examples for shared Series/DataFrame functionality are only implemented in NDFrame, and don't get picked up in our tests that run Series/DataFrame tests individually.\r\n\r\nIn addition the PR implements a few simple operatiosn that are tested on NDFrame:\r\n- `first`, `last`, `head`, `tail` are all now `WontImplement(order-sensitive)` on both DataFrame and Series\r\n- Adds an implementation for `tz_localize`.\r\n- Adds implementations for `bool()`, `size`, `empty`, `equals()` (all of these do some pre-aggregation followed by a final Singleton aggregation).\r\n- Adds implementation for `ndim` that defers to the proxy.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
