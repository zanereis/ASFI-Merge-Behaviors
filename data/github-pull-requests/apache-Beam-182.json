is a first working version of a Java Runner based on Hazelcast Jet (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jet). With it we have aimed for the batching (bounded data) scenario for now, but adding the missing pieces for unbounded data is something we fully intend to do. \r\n\r\nThe functionality is relatively complete, see the **`validatesRunner`** task in the `:beam-runners-jet` module. I've excluded the Splittable DoFn tests completely, because we have not implemented that functionality yet and also the single test case for Impulse, because we have a problem with that related to parallelism. Beyond these though the results are: `235 tests completed, 10 failed, 2 skipped`. The 10 failed ones are also caused by missing features, like timer support, multi-graph support and such. Again, to be solved soon.\r\n\r\nThe **Nexmark testsuite** also runs, I'm using the following params: `-Pnexmark.runner=:beam-runners-jet -Pnexmark.args=\"--runner=JetRunner --suite=SMOKE --streaming=false --manageResources=false --monitorJobs=true --jetGroupName=jet\"`\r\n\r\nThe last two Nexmark queries aren't being run successfully, but the cause of that seems to be external to our specific runner, a `NullPointerException` at `NexmarkQueryName.fromNumber(NexmarkQueryName.java:78)`. \r\n\r\nThis is it. What we have done so far is mostly about pure functionality. We have not yet worked on performance (for example we don't do any pipeline surgery or fusing), which is far away from what standalone Jet is capable of, but I hope that this is still a worth-vile start. \r\n\r\nLots and lots of things remain to be added and improved but I'm really curious what you think about it so far and would really appreciate your feedback.\r\n\r\nR: @kennknowles \r\nR: @mxm \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change updates code in sdks/go/pkg/beam to use the new errors package, and (mostly) does not change code in any sub-directories. It should be the first of several PRs to update all our Go SDK code to use the new errors where possible.\r\n\r\nThat said, this change isn't as \"clean\" as I'd like it to be. During the course of changing the calls I decided to change some of the messages slightly to more accurately match the intended style of errors that this package promotes (i.e. context should say \"doing this\" instead of \"something broke\"). You can see this in the spots where I completely changed error messages. But in order to retain all the useful information, I sometimes had to go and edit the calls that generated the error and so forth. So this PR is a mix of actual error improvements and just changing calls.\r\n\r\nFor future PRs in this effort I'm definitely going to keep it more strict and not change any error implementations (I can note those down and put them in their own PR). Unfortunately I was too far into this change to separate it out easily, so whoever reviews this gets the short end of the stick.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a way to construct a stream with control over elements and\r\ntime. In total, 40 ValidatesRunner tests make use of this feature (tagged via\r\nUsesTestStream). So far only the DirectRunner supported TestStream which meant\r\nthat those tests were not executed for other Runners, e.g. Flink.\r\n\r\nImplementing TestStream for Flink was not hard, except for supporting the\r\nprocessing time functionality for which a clean solution seems impossible.\r\nHowever, only 2 of the 40 UsesTestStream tests make use of processing time.\r\nAn annotation (UsesTestStreamWithProcessingTime) was added to allow Runners to\r\nexclude those tests.\r\n\r\nThis still adds 38 new ValidatesRunner tests in Flink streaming mode.\r\n\r\nCC @tweise @kennknowles

avoids unnecessary serialization. For example, if a groupByKey is happening & part of the shuffle ends up on the current worker, we'll avoid the unnecessary serialize/deserialize cycle.\r\n\r\nThe main actual change in this PR (other than replacing `byte[]` with `ValueAndCoderSerializable`) is in `GroupNonMergingWindowsFunctions`. The semantics are slightly different in that we defer to Spark's serializer to serialize the values. This allows the previous optimization to keep working in a lazy way - if there are a lot of windows for a single value, Spark *should* serialize them only once since it's the same reference. In case Kryo is being used, the option `spark.kryo.referenceTracking` controls this behavior & defaults to true. For Java serialization, it's the only behavior available.\r\n\r\nI didn't touch spark streaming in this PR because I'm not sure how to address the backwards compatibility problem. Any thoughts there?\r\n\r\nR: @iemejia @RyanSkraba \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

attempt to reconnect logging client causes SDKHarness to get stuck during termination and eventually cause thread leak as each attempt to reconnect create some threads on GRPC side.\r\n\r\nThe pr deletes the logging stub before reconnecting so that grpc can clean its state.\r\nThe PR also introduces _alive flag which is used to determine if logging client should reconnect on disconnect.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Beam, a timer with timestamp `T` is only illegible for firing when the time\r\nhas moved past this time stamp, i.e. `T < current_time`. In the case of event\r\ntime, current_time is the watermark, in the case of processing time it is the\r\nsystem time.\r\n\r\nFlink's TimerService has different semantics because it only ensures \r\n`T <= current_time`. To make up for this, we previously subtracted one from the\r\nWatermark. However, this does not fix the problem for processing time. We can't\r\nmodify processing time easily like we can for event time via the watermark.\r\n\r\nTo fix processing timers, we change Flink's internal timer timestamp. We add one\r\nmillisecond to the timestamp to ensure that the time has moved past the original\r\ntimer timestamp in both event and processing time.\r\n\r\nNote that we do not modify Beam's timestamp and we do not expose Flink's\r\ntimestamp. For consistency this approach has also been applied to event time\r\ntimers.\r\n\r\nCC @aljoscha @kennknowles @pbartoszek\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

there is only a single split key, `splitKeysToFilters` does not compute the correct result. For example, if the split key is \"_id: 56\", only the range filter \"_id lower than or equal to 56\" is produced. It should also include a filter \"_id greater than 56\". If this happens, the resulting PCollection includes only the data until the first split; the remainder is not included.\r\n\r\nWhile producing the fix for this issue, I noticed that `splitKeysToMatch` suffers from the same issue, and additionally, that the last split is also produced incorrectly. If the splits are, say, 56, 109, and 256, it produces <=56, 56--109 and >= 109, instead of <=56, 56--109, 109--256 and >=256. A fix for both issues is included as well.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Python3 performance benchmarks - part 2\r\n\r\nKeep use of Perfkit performance infrastructure for Python3 benchmarking due to exist integration with Python pipeline and automated metrics publishing. Part 1 changes are on PerfkitBenchmarker in https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/pull/1900/commits/d0ad984e2ae4d836fc7d6440e44104d2b469ec98\r\n\r\nChanges include in this PR:\r\n- Move python performance test parameters to new class `PythonPerformanceTestConfiguration` to make task construction clear and easier to maintain.\r\n- Create `enablePythonPerformanceTest` in `BeamModulePlugin` so that people can enable python performance test in different projects by simply calling this function.\r\n- Enable performance tests in Python3 project `sdks/python/test-suites/dataflow/py3`\r\n- Fix a bug in `run_integration_test.sh` due to wrong check order.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

discussion on the mailing list (and repeated failures of `:testWebsite` on my PRs), I think it might be wise to disable testing external links for that task by default. If one wishes, external links can optionally be tested with the following command:\r\n\r\n`./gradlew :beam-website:testWebsite -PdisableExternal=false`\r\n\r\nUpdate: I added the full website test as a postcommit. Now precommit does _not_ check external links, while the postcommit does. One can also invoke the full test on a PR by commenting `Run Full Website Test`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
