But when you build\r\nprod images, you would accidentaly override it with the\r\npython base image available in python repo which might be\r\ndifferent (newer and not yet tested in CI).

taskgroup decorator which can be used to create taskgroup from python callable. Inside python callable tasks can be grouped by calling tasks (python callable ) created with task decorator.\r\n\r\n- taskgroup decorator takes both optional and keyword argument which are passed to Constructor of TaskGroup class.\r\n\r\n- TaskGroup can be created with one of following syntax\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n@taskgroup\r\n@taskgroup()\r\n@taskgroup(group_id='group_name')\r\n```\r\n\r\n- TaskGroup class  constructor takes one mandatory argument group_id, if not given in decorator it sets group_id to python callable name.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a simple example demonstrating use of taskgroup decorator grouping multiple tasks.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n@task\r\ndef task_1(value):\r\n  return f'[ Task1 {value} ]'\r\n\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_2(value):\r\n  print(f'[ Task2 {value} ]')\r\n\r\n\r\n@taskgroup\r\ndef section_1(value):\r\n  return task_2(task_1(value))\r\n```\r\n\r\ntaskgroup decorator utilizes existing TaskGroup context manager currently used for creating TaskGroup, which means we can create nested taskgroup by created nested callable. Following is an example demonstrating use of nested taskgroup.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n@task\r\ndef task_start():\r\n    return '[Task_start]'\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_end():\r\n    print(f'[ Task_End ]')\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_1(value):\r\n    return f'[ Task1 {value} ]'\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_2(value):\r\n    print(f'[ Task2 {value} ]')\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_3(value):\r\n    return f'[ Task3 {value} ]'\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef task_4(value):\r\n    print(f'[ Task4 {value} ]')\r\n\r\n@taskgroup\r\ndef section_1(value):\r\n\r\n    @taskgroup\r\n    def section_2(value2):\r\n        return task_4(task_3(value2))\r\n\r\n    op1 = task_2(task_1(value))\r\n    return section_2(op1) \r\n```\r\n\r\nDedicated test cases for taskgroup decorator is created in file \r\n/tests/utils/test_task_group_decorator.py\r\n\r\ncloses: #11870\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

than counting changed layers in the image (which was\r\nenigmatic, difficult and prone to some magic number) we rely now\r\non random file generated while building the image.\r\n\r\nWe are using the docker image caching mechanism here. The random\r\nfile will be regenerated only when the previous layer (which is\r\nabout installling Airflow dependencies for the first time) gets\r\nrebuild. And for us this is the indication, that the building\r\nthe image will take quite some time. This layer should be\r\nrelatively static - even if setup.py changes the CI image is\r\ndesigned in the way that the first time installation of Airflow\r\ndependencies is not invalidated.\r\n\r\nThis should lead to faster and less frequent rebuild for people\r\nusing Breeze and static checks.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

new Python version is released (bugfixes), we rebuild the CI image\r\nand replace it with the new one, however releasing of the python\r\nimage and CI image is often hours or even days apart (we only\r\nrelease the CI image when tests pass in master with the new python\r\nimage). We already use a better approach for Github - we simply\r\npush the new python image to our registry together with the CI\r\nimage and the CI jobs are always pulling them from our registry\r\nknowing that the two - python and CI image are in sync.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the same approach. We not only push CI image\r\nbut also the corresponding Python image to our registry. This has\r\nno ill effect - DockerHub handles it automatically and reuses\r\nthe layers of the image directly from the Python one so it is\r\nmerely a label that is stored in our registry that points to the\r\nexact Python image that was used by the last pushed CI image.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is a followup PR for what I was describing in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/10584#issuecomment-715530418.\r\n\r\nThis adds support for:\r\n\r\n* Creating configMaps and secrets from the chart itself ; this can be used for https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/11707 (especially connections values that should end up in a secret) and maybe other use cases.\r\n* Adding extra `env` and `envFrom` items to the airflow containers created by the chart (strictly independent from `extraSecrets` / `extraConfigMaps`).\r\n\r\nThe values are of type string to enable for generic templating.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found in the commits messages.\r\n\r\nCloses #10584\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

K9s is fantastic tool that helps to debug a running k8s\r\ninstance. It is terminal-based windowed CLI that makes you\r\nseveral times more productive comparing to using kubectl\r\ncommands. We've integrated k9s (it is run as a docker container\r\nand downloaded on demand). We've also separated out KUBECONFIG\r\nof the integrated kind cluster so that it does not mess with\r\nkubernetes configuration you might already have.\r\n\r\nAlso - together with that the \"surrounding\" of the kubernetes\r\ntests were simplified and improved so that the k9s integration\r\ncan be utilized well. Instead of kubectl port forwarding (which\r\ncaused multitude of problems) we are now utilizing kind's\r\nportMapping feature + custom NodePort resource that maps\r\nport 8080 to 30007 NodePort which in turn maps it to 8080\r\nport of the Webserver. This way we do not have to establish\r\nan external kubectl port forward which is prone to error and\r\nmanagement - everything is brought up when Airflow gets\r\ndeployed to the Kind Cluster and shuts down when the Kind\r\ncluster is stopped.\r\n\r\nYet another problem fixed was killing of postgres by one of the\r\nkubernetes tests ('test_integration_run_dag_with_scheduler_failure').\r\nInstead of just killing the scheduler it killed all pods - including\r\nthe Postgres one (it was named 'airflow-postgres.*'). That caused\r\nvarious problems, as the database could be left in a strange state.\r\nI changed the tests to do what it claimed was doing - so killing only the\r\nscheduler during the test. This seemed to improve the stability\r\nof tests immensely in my local setup.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request
