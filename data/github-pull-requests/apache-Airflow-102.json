change ##30302 split Job from JobRunner, but it missed the fact that SchedulerJob had a special case of checking the threshold - instead of using the standard grace multiplier, it used whatever has been defined in the `scheduler_helth_check_threshold`. The `is_alive` method in SchedulerJobRunner has remained unused, and default 2.1 grace multiplier has been used for both /health endpoint and `airflow jobs check`.\r\n\r\nThis PR brings the exception for SchedulerJob back and clarifies that the same treshold is also used for airflow jobs check in the documentation.\r\n\r\nFixes: #31200\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Deprecating the `delimiter` parameter and wildcards in source objects is essential. These features are not native to the GCS API; they were implemented as a workaround that now heavily misuses the `delimiter` parameter. This implementation likely stems from the fact that the new parameter, `match_glob`, did not exist when these features were initially implemented. By utilizing this parameter instead of `delimiter` - the original issue resolves.\r\n2. Unfortunately, the `match_glob` param is not supported by the official GCS **Python** API today. To deal with it, I copied and patched [list_blob()](https://github.com/googleapis/python-storage/blob/504995f193239a0d69a62020b6af3ce88201f677/google/cloud/storage/client.py#L1107) directly from their source code to the hook. I'm unsure if it's OK to do regarding licensing and maintainability from our side. If it's fine, let me know if I need to add any additional licensing comments - otherwise, we'll have to wait until the official release (according to GCP's comment on my [issue](https://github.com/googleapis/python-storage/issues/1035) - it should be around Q3).\r\n4. Within the modified transfer operations (`GCSToGCSOperator`, `GCSToSFTPOperator`, `GCSToGoogleDriveOperator`), there is an internal logic that deals with wildcards in the store object(s) and calls the `list()` method with the `delimiter` param. To avoid any chances of breaking existing behavior, I intentionally avoided using the `match_glob` param there. I added commentary that instructs what should be changed when finalizing the deprecation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

bumping the dependencies of Google Provider we found out that elasticsearch >= 7.15.0 (which we never tested before because of other constraints) breaks our tests. Since there is an 8 version of eleastic search available as of 2021, we should - rather than solve the tests in 7, likely migrate to version 8, which should likely involve getting rid of elastisearch-dsl, because it has limitations of elasticsearch <8.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

leveraging Generics, the typing for Runners and Job and JobPydantic is now more complete and accurate.\r\n\r\n* Scheduler and Backfill Runners limit their code to Job and can use all the things that ORM Job allows them to do\r\n\r\n* Other runners are limited to union of Job and JobPydantic version so that they can be run on the client side of the internal API without having all the Job features.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up after #31182 that fixed missing job_type for DagProcessor Job and nicely extracted job to BaseRunner but broke MyPy/Typing guards implemented in the runners that should aid the AIP-44 implementation.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

was a 404 on the DAG Audit Log for bootstrap toggle css, which as far as I can tell, we aren't even trying to use. So we will no longer try and add it to the page.\r\n\r\nThis highlighted the fact that if we don't have an asset in the manifest, `url_for_asset` would just leave off the filename completely. This resulted in the href being just `/static/`, with no filename as a breadcrumb in the eventual 404. Now we will just use the filename as-is so the 404 is more meaningful.","created_at":"2023-05-11T23:26:38Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T06:22:29Z","closed_at":"2023-05-12T19:12:14Z","merged_at":"2023-05-12T19:12:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b4ad8a18c7c3975a30afe86030b2db9f8daf6f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

the change in PR #27376, we started pushing the Spark `appId` \r\nto `XCOM` when executing the `LivyOperator` in standard (non-defferable) \r\nmode. This commit now pushes the `appId` to `XCOM` in `deferrable` mode \r\ntoo to keep the expected outcome consistent for the operator so that \r\nsubsequent tasks can fetch and use the `appId` from `XCOM`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

requires that the bucket is empty before it can be deleted but does not provide a convenient `empty_bucket` method.  We have found that on some edge cases, an API call might write logs or artifacts to the S3 bucket with a delay, which causes the delete_bucket task to fail if the object was added while we were iterating the list of objects.  This PR attempts to ensure all objects are actually deleted by retrying (up to N times) until no objects remain before trying to delete the bucket.\r\n\r\n@o-nikolas , @vincbeck , @vandonr-amz  - This

added some code earlier to get a description of the pod when k8s system tests are failing (#30134)\r\n\r\nI thought I had tested this code, but apparently not well enough, because there was 2 problems:\r\n 1. the way the bash command was written was incorrect, the arguments were passed to `/bin/bash` instead of the command it was running (so it was failing on the first command because it didn't \"see\" the `--reinstalled` and returned an error saying aws cli was already installed)\r\n 2. name of the pod, needed to be able to describe it, is only pushed to xcom at the end of the `execute`, so if there is an error in there, it's not pushed, and we don't know what to describe.\r\n\r\nI fixed the bash by using `;` instead of `&&` to chain commands, and moved the xcom parameter setting higher in the operator.\r\n\r\nAlso, while I was at it, I realized it was a bit stupid to force reinstall each time just to have no error, and replaced that with a `|| true` to just ignore the error if there is one.","created_at":"2023-05-10T21:36:03Z","updated_at":"2023-05-11T19:00:01Z","closed_at":"2023-05-11T18:52:18Z","merged_at":"2023-05-11T18:52:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"e7cb9ca2c152e7ba1e8b785d6d2a60ac79edba02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

was an upper version bound on pymongo of `<4.0.0` because versions 4.0.0+ removed the `ssl_cert_reqs` parameter from client connection options. However, comparing the pymongo 3.7.0 docs (https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/3.7.0/examples/tls.html#certificate-verification-policy) to the 4.3.3 docs\r\n(https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/4.3.3/examples/tls.html#certificate-verification-policy) it seems that `ssl_cert_reqs` has been effectively renamed to `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes upper version bound on pymongo, and adds a test to set `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates` for pymongo 4.0.0 and later, while continuing to use `ssl_cert_reqs` for earlier versions of

Description\r\n\r\nWe're running custom probes on the dag processor component.\r\n\r\nSince the DagProcessor component is represented as a `job_runner`, we're running SQL queries to check the latest_heartbeat for the associated job object.\r\n\r\nTo speed up queries in big deployments, we're using a the index on `job_type`:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT latest_heartbeat FROM job\r\n  WHERE\r\n    job_type = 'DagProcessorJob'\r\n  AND\r\n    hostname = '%s';\r\n```\r\n (hostname being the IP address of the k8s pod).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there's a bug currently, and the job_type is always

are several improvements for the docker-compose tests of ours. They have not been well documented and explained, also they had problems with running in the new docker-comppose v2 environment. The healthcheck failures were not easy to debug as well when they failed in CI.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all the problems:\r\n\r\n* TESTING.rst describes the tests explains how they work and provides instructions on how to reproduce them locally and debug them\r\n\r\n* The test now check which version of docker-compose is available and act accordingly (both v2 and v1 version are automatically supported)\r\n\r\n* When the test fails, additionally to docker compose logs and process status, the state of all health checks is dumped so that it is clear why the health check failed\r\n\r\n* A way is added to not shut down docker-compose after the test complete, which allows to inspect them\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

a configuration flag to disable the use of md5 for security in Python >= 3.9. If Python < 3.9 is being used, this flag will not provide any effect on the existing behaviour. This is mainly for backward compatibility suggested in: https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/25625\r\n\r\nWith this configuration combined with the newly introduced flag to change the caching hash method (introduced in: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30675), airflow will be able to run in the environment restricted by FIPS 140-2 requirements.\r\n\r\nBackground: I have been running in FIPS enabled environment for my company, in order to do that we would have to fork out Airflow and introduce all the changes so that Airflow is fully functional. That added extra complexity when upgrading Airflow to the latest version. Also, a few people show interest in running Airflow in FIPS environment so I want to introduce the change in Airflow so we can all take advantage of that.\r\n\r\n Testing done:\r\n - run pre-commit\r\n - running unit tests with `Breeze` for the following Python versions: python 3.9, python 3.7\r\n - Starting up airflow with `Breeze` and running the preloaded example dags in both Python 3.9 and Python 3.7 \r\n \r\nThanks @vchiapaikeo for the work on the hashlib wrapper and the configurable caching\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-09T21:22:58Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T16:07:12Z","closed_at":"2023-05-26T13:06:37Z","merged_at":"2023-05-26T13:06:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"22e44ab9f2f3a68aa2ed236cfe514554dd479a38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6T

a provider package depends on new version of another provider that might not yet been released, we have to make sure that this provider is part of the chunk that is being installed in parallell runs, otherwise the installation might fail due to a conflict as the pip version of the provider will not be found.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by adding directly downstream providers to the chunk that is being installed. It also handles two edge cases:\r\n\r\n1) when number of providers is lower than parallelism we only launch\r\n   as many parallel processes as we have providers\r\n\r\n2) when number of providers is 0, we short-circuit the installation\r\n   immediately.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR adds `BigQueryExtractor` that gets OpenLineage data from `BigQueryExecuteQueryOperator`.\r\n\r\nDespite being SQL-based, this extractor isn't based on the SQLExtractor due to the fact that BigQuery has an API that allows us to get the lineage data directly from it.

like to use Airflow's own datetime picker widget, especially when writing web view plugins with FAB. With the existing implementation, the input is always required, but sometimes I have use cases where a datetime value is optional. This pull request made a simple change that parameterize whether the input tag will have the `required` attribute when instantiating an instance of this widget.\r\n\r\nA default `True` is assigned so that the original behavior is preserved.","created_at":"2023-05-09T04:21:19Z","updated_at":"2023-07-16T03:31:13Z","closed_at":"2023-07-16T03:31:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8438c1fd030c084102abc19d62b0c679f08964a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"utkarsharma2","id":13021213,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDIxMjEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13021213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsharma2","html_url":"https://github.com/utkarsharma2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsharma2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsharma2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsharma2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsharma2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsharma2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsharma2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsharma2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsharma2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/utkarsharma2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type"

change adds conditional processing of output based on criteria that can be overridden by the operator extending the common.sql BaseSQLOperator. Originally, output processing has only been happening if \"do_xcom_push\" was enabled, but in some cases we want to run processing also when do_xcom_push is disabled (for example in case of databricks SQL operator, it might be done when the output is redirected to a file).\r\n\r\nThis change enables it.\r\n\r\nFixes: #31080\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
