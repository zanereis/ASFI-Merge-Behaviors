The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThrows an exception if a variant is the input/output type to/from python UDF, UDAF, UDTF\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\ncurrently, variant input/output types to scalar UDFs will fail during execution or return a `net.razorvine.pickle.objects.ClassDictConstructor` to the user python code. For a better UX, we should fail during query compilation for failures, and block returning `ClassDictConstructor` to user code as we one day want to actually return `VariantVal`s to the user code. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes - attempting to use variants in python UDFs will now throw an exception rather than returning a `ClassDictConstructor` as before. However, we want to make this change now as we one day want to be able to return `VariantVal`s to the user code and do not want users relying on this current behavior\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI think there are two issues regarding the default column name of `cast`:\r\n1, It seems unclear that when the name is the input column or `CAST(...)`, e.g. in Spark Classic,\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.range(1).select(col(\"id\").cast(\"string\"), lit(1).cast(\"string\"), col(\"id\").cast(\"long\"), lit(1).cast(\"long\")).printSchema\r\nwarning: 1 deprecation (since 2.13.3); for details, enable `:setting -deprecation` or `:replay -deprecation`\r\nroot\r\n |-- id: string (nullable = false)\r\n |-- CAST(1 AS STRING): string (nullable = false)\r\n |-- id: long (nullable = false)\r\n |-- CAST(1 AS BIGINT): long (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2, the column name is not consistent between Spark Connect and Spark Classic.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to resolve the second issue, that is, making default column name of `cast` compatible with Spark Classic, by comparing with classic implementation\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9cf6dc873ff34412df6256cdc7613eed40716570/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Column.scala#L1208-L1212\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nthe default column name is not consistent with the spark classic\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes,\r\n\r\nspark classic:\r\n```\r\nIn [2]:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR addresses a type casting issue in Spark SQL where comparing a string column to an integer value results in an empty result set. The changes ensure that Spark SQL handles such comparisons in a manner similar to Redshift by casting the integer to a string before comparison.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current behavior in Spark SQL leads to unexpected empty result sets when comparing a string column to an integer value. This is inconsistent with the behavior of other SQL systems like Redshift, which cast the integer to a string for comparison. The changes are needed to make Spark SQL's behavior more intuitive and consistent with other systems.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Users will now get expected results when comparing string columns to integer values in Spark SQL. Previously, such comparisons would yield empty result sets due to type casting issues.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch was tested by adding new unit tests in the **BinaryComparisonSuite** to cover various comparison scenarios between string columns and integer values. These tests ensure that the comparisons behave as expected and return correct results.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-07T21:49:28Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T00:24:38Z","closed_at":"2025-01-20T00:24:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b08dcefe2e0197db26015d247c74acd75ca7a43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Masykus","id":29818007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE4MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29818007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masykus","html_url":"https://github.com/Masykus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masykus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masykus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masykus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masykus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masykus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masykus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masykus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masykus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masykus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"abhiips07","id":70813641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODEzNjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70813641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiips07","html_url":"https://github.com/abhiips07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiips07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiips07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiips07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiips07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiips07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiips07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiips07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiips07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhiips07/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8897629d74b94f305992d2d801e97cbd45d15c11","head":{"label":"Zawa-ll:SPARK-48652","ref":"SPARK-48652","sha":"8897629d74b94f305992d2d801e97cbd45d15c11","user":{"login":"Zawa-ll","id":112773683,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrjKMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112773683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll","html_url":"https://github.com/Zawa-ll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":825471124,"node_id":"R_kgDOMTOwlA","name":"spark","full_name":"Zawa-ll/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Zawa-ll","id":112773683,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrjKMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112773683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll","html_url":"https://github.com/Zawa-ll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zawa-ll/received_events

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEagerly execute union multi commands together.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMultiInsert is split to multiple sql executions, resulting in no exchange reuse.\r\n\r\nReproduce sql:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table wangzhen_t1(c1 int);\r\ncreate table wangzhen_t2(c1 int);\r\ncreate table wangzhen_t3(c1 int);\r\ninsert into wangzhen_t1 values (1), (2), (3);\r\n\r\nfrom (select /*+ REPARTITION(3) */ c1 from wangzhen_t1)\r\ninsert overwrite table wangzhen_t2 select c1\r\ninsert overwrite table wangzhen_t3 select c1; \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Spark 3.1, there is only one SQL execution and there is a reuse exchange.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/17894939/5ff68392-aaa8-4e6b-8cac-1687880796b9)\r\n\r\nHowever, in Spark 3.5, it was split to multiple executions and there was no ReuseExchange.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/17894939/afdb14b6-5007-4923-802d-535149974ecf)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/17894939/0d60e8db-9da7-4906-8d07-2b622b55e6ab)\r\n\r\n\r\n###

behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes,  multi  inserts will executed in one execution.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded unit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-05T07:09:50Z","updated_at":"2024-07-10T12:26:40Z","closed_at":"2024-07-10T01:10:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ecb579106ccdbd7f16af692598e48f50b233eef6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/01f34634067b8dbf2469e384b918f26a596c7c89","head":{"label":"wForget:SPARK-48817","ref":"SPARK-48817","sha":"01f34634067b8dbf2469e384b918f26a596c7c89","user":{"login":"wForget","id":17894939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk0OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17894939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget","html_url":"https://github.com/wForget","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":362712307,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjI3MTIzMDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"wForget/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wForget","id":17894939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk0OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17894939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget","html_url":"https://github.com/wForget","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wForget/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wForget/spark","description":"Apache

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove the error handling of the `stop()` API in the `SparkSesion`\r\nclass to not throw if there is any error related to releasing a session or\r\nclosing the underlying GRPC channel. Both are best effort.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Pyspark, do not fail if the local Spark Connect service\r\ncannot be stopped.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the Spark Connect Service will terminate the session, usually\r\nbecause the underlying cluster or driver has restarted.\r\nIn the cases, calling stop() throws an error which is unactionable. However,\r\nstop() still needs to be called in order to reset the active session.\r\n\r\nFurther, the stop() API should be idempotent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAttached unit tests.\r\n\r\nConfirmed that removing the code changes results in the\r\ntests failing (as expected).\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-04T13:11:42Z","updated_at":"2024-07-10T07:07:36Z","closed_at":"2024-07-08T08:04:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ed35ea93df726f35da7187384d06a8d5cb1fb5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47215/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47215/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47215/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b07a28b15913b352fea59297027366cc8a06ba09","head":{"label":"nija-at:session-stop","ref":"session-stop","sha":"b07a28b15913b352fea59297027366cc8a06ba09","user":{"login":"nija-at","id":16217941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at","html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":590063058,"node_id":"R_kgDOIyul0g","name":"spark","full_name":"nija-at/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nija-at","id":16217941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at","html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to using `pydata_sphinx_theme`'s `embedded` `version-switcher` to reimplement `spark version drop down` of the `PySpark doc site` and fix bug for `4.0.0-preview1`'s python api docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- When I was reviewing  `4.0.0-preview1`'s docs, I found that `spark version drop down of the PySpark doc site` is no longer usable (when clicking, `the dropdown menu` will no longer display), as follows:\r\n  https://spark.apache.org/docs/4.0.0-preview1/api/python/index.html\r\n  <img width=\"1164\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/e4bf241b-180b-4f03-aec3-809ebb697faf\">\r\n  With the continuous updates of sphinx and its dependent component versions that generate Python documents, the `version-switcher` originally implemented by custom extensions is no longer usable, and we need to fix it\r\n\r\n- After\r\n  <img width=\"1384\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/40d37913-a23c-43a4-b95e-391ad4a0edc9\">\r\n  **It looks more in line with the current theme `CSS style` and looks more `beautiful`**\r\n\r\n- In addition, to cooperate with this fix, we need to update the content of the `spark-website/site/static/versions.json` file, as follows:\r\n  <img width=\"494\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/fc25af5a-34e0-4c05-8476-3557510cda27\">\r\n **I will complete it in another separate PR**\r\n  The modified file `versions.json` will be compatible with the implementation of `spark 3.5.1` and the `new implementation`.\r\n  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/310f8ea2456dad7cec0f22bfed05a679764c3d7e/python/docs/source/_templates/version-switcher.html#L63-L73\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-04T12:04:42Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T03:53:00Z","closed_at":"2025-01-14T03:52:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fa52de3e036138a6d40401d14470044bbf663f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e3dff8e73ab34ffd6bf8cbc8a7acf606bfbf961","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-48809","ref":"SPARK-48809","sha":"3e3dff8e73ab34ffd6bf8cbc8a7acf606bfbf961","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the internal code of Spark, there are instances where, despite having a SparkSession instance, the bridged APIs based on SparkSession#sqlContext are still used. Therefore, this PR makes some simplifications in this regard:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1. `SparkSession#sqlContext#read` -> `SparkSession#read`\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n/**\r\n   * Returns a [[DataFrameReader]]

`SparkSession#sharedState`\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nprivate[sql] def sharedState: SharedState = sparkSession.sharedState\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. `SparkSession#sqlContext#streams` -> `SparkSession#streams`\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n/**\r\n   * Returns a `StreamingQueryManager` that allows managing all the\r\n   * [[org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.StreamingQuery StreamingQueries]] active on `this` context.\r\n   *\r\n   * @since 2.0.0\r\n   */\r\n  def streams: StreamingQueryManager = sparkSession.streams\r\n```\r\n\r\n8. `SparkSession#sqlContext#uncacheTable` -> `SparkSession#catalog#uncacheTable`\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n/**\r\n   * Removes the specified table from the in-memory cache.\r\n   * @group cachemgmt\r\n   * @since 1.3.0\r\n   */\r\n  def

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduces `spark.profile.render` for SparkSession-based profiling.\r\n\r\nIt uses [`flameprof`](https://github.com/baverman/flameprof/) for the default renderer.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install flameprof\r\n```\r\n\r\nrun `pyspark` on Jupyter notebook:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.pyspark.udf.profiler\", \"perf\")\r\n\r\ndf = spark.range(10)\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"long\")\r\ndef add1(x):\r\n    return x + 1\r\n\r\nadded = df.select(add1(\"id\"))\r\nadded.show()\r\n\r\nspark.profile.render(id=2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1103\" alt=\"pyspark-udf-profile\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/506656/795972e8-f7eb-4b89-89fc-3d8d18b86541\">\r\n\r\nOn CLI, it will return `svg` source string.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n'<?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"no\"?>\\n<!DOCTYPE svg  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently only `renderer=\"flameprof\"` for `type=\"perf\"` is supported as a builtin renderer.\r\n\r\nYou can also pass an arbitrary renderer.\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef render_perf(stats):\r\n    ...\r\nspark.profile.render(id=2, type=\"perf\", renderer=render_perf)\r\n\r\ndef render_memory(codemap):\r\n    ...\r\nspark.profile.render(id=2, type=\"memory\", renderer=render_memory)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBetter debuggability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, `spark.profile.render` will be available.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded/updated the related tests, and manually.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup to a bug identified from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45362.  When setting `maxCachedFiles` to 0 (to force a full relisting of files for each batch, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44924) subsequent batches of files would be skipped due to a logic error that carried forward an empty array of `unreadFiles` which was only being null checked.  This update includes additional checks to verify that `unreadFiles` is also non-empty as a guard condition to prevent batches executing with no files, as well as checks to ensure that `unreadFiles` is only set if a) there are files remaining in the listing and b) `maxCachedFiles` is greater than 0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSetting the `maxCachedFiles` configuration to 0 would inadvertently cause every other batch to contain 0 files, which is an unexpected behavior for users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nFixes the case where users may want to always perform a full listing of files each batch by setting `maxCachedFiles` to 0\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew test added to verify `maxCachedFiles` set to 0 would perform a file listing each batch\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-03T04:12:36Z","updated_at":"2024-07-08T07:24:09Z","closed_at":"2024-07-08T07:24:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8150099bd3c3634245ccf55a596d933c9abbe52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd task on/off heap execution memory in `TaskMetrics`, tracked in `TaskMemoryManager`, **assuming `acquireExecutionMemory` is the only one narrow waist for acquiring execution memory.**\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no task on/off heap execution memory metrics. \r\n\r\nThere is a [peakExecutionMemory](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3cd35f8cb6462051c621cf49de54b9c5692aae1d/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/TaskMetrics.scala#L114)  metrics, however, the semantic is a confusing: it only cover the execution memory used by shuffle/join/aggregate/sort, which is accumulated in specific operators and thus not really reflect the real execution memory.\r\n\r\nTherefore it's necessary to add these two metrics. \r\n\r\nAlso I created two followup sub tickets:\r\n\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48788 : accumulate task metrics in stage, and display in Spark UI\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48789 : deprecate `peakExecutionMemory` once we have replacement for it.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is to have these two metrics ready (as accumulated stage metrics in Spark UI as well) and deprecate `peakExecutionMemory`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nSupposedly no. But two followup sub tickets will have user-facing change: new metrics exposed to Spark UI, and old metrics deprecation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnew test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNO\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-03T01:21:56Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T16:39:32Z","closed_at":"2024-08-07T18:52:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"48cb7d72084552175b27819badd86aee73bd4f9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47192/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47192/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47192/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/07c271327ef98b7c49d2223056a312cae1db2b31","head":{"label":"liuzqt:SPARK-48628","ref":"SPARK-48628","sha":"07c271327ef98b7c49d2223056a312cae1db2b31","user":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":511387078,"node_id":"R_kgDOHnslxg","name":"spark","full_name":"liuzqt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt/spark","description":"Apache

If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nStored procedures are routines invoked via CALL statements. They are commonly used for encapsulating non-trivial operations and may contain multiple commands, conditional logic, and side effects. These changes are needed to allow catalogs to expose custom routines to Spark. This effort aims to enhance Spark’s ability to interact with external connectors and allow users to perform more operations in plain SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, this PR adds new connector APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR I propose that we introduce versioning of connectors that is different of spark versioning.\r\nEach connector should have its own version. This way we decouple spark version from connector versions, and customers can upgrade spark without the need to modify connectors as well.\r\nOften times we introduce breaking changes (such as type mapping for example, which can cause schema do not match exception for hive tables).\r\n\r\nI suggest we introduce 2 level of versions that each connector will have:\r\n - JDBC version (for common changes, such as `JdbcUtils`)\r\n - Dialect version (for dialect specific changes, such as `PostgresDialect`)\r\n\r\nIdea is to always roll forward and avoid config explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo decouple spark version from connector version.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nExposes new configs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis is config change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to #47152 against `branch-3.5`.\r\n\r\nAdd migration guide for `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT...` behavior change. \r\n\r\nSPARK-41859 changes the behaviour for `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT ...` from OVERWRITE to APPEND when `spark.sql.legacy.allowNonEmptyLocationInCTAS` is set to `true`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndrop table if exists test_table;\r\ncreate table test_table location '/tmp/test_table' stored as parquet as select 1 as col union all select 2 as col;\r\ndrop table if exists test_table;\r\ncreate table test_table location '/tmp/test_table' stored as parquet as select 3 as col union all select 4 as col;\r\nselect * from test_table;\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis produces {3, 4} in Spark <3.4.0 and {1, 2, 3, 4} in Spark 3.4.0 and later. This is a silent change in `spark.sql.legacy.allowNonEmptyLocationInCTAS` behaviour which introduces wrong results in the user application.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis documents a behavior change starting in Spark 3.4 for `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n`doc build\r\n`\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this pull request i propose to change default ISO pattern we use for formatting timestamps when we are writing to json,xml and/or csv as well as when to_(xml|json|csv) is used.\r\n\r\nOlder timestamps sometimes have offsets that contain seconds part as well. Current default formatting used is omitting seconds hence providing wrong results.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\nsql(\"SET spark.sql.session.timeZone=America/Los_Angeles\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT to_json(struct(CAST('1800-01-01T00:00:00+00:00' AS TIMESTAMP) AS ts))\").show(false)\r\n{\"ts\":\"1799-12-31T16:07:02.000-07:52\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users will now see different results for older timestamps (correct ones).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove the exposed `SQLContext` which was added in SPARK-46575. And migrate STS internal used `SQLContext` to `SparkSession`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`SQLContext` is not recommended since Spark 2.0, the suggested replacement is `SparkSession`. We should avoid exposing the deprecated class to Developer API in new versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. It touched the Developer API added in SPARK-46575, but is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GHA, and `dev/mima` (not breaking changes involved)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n * Add a constraint for `numpy<2` to the PySpark package\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPySpark references some code which was removed with NumPy 2.0. Thus, if `numpy>=2` is installed, executing PySpark may fail.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47083 updates the `master` branch to be compatible with NumPy 2. This PR adds a version bound for older releases, where it won't be applied.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNumPy will be limited to `numpy<2` when installing `pypspark` with extras `ml`, `mllib`, `sql`, `pandas_on_spark` or `connect`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nVia existing CI jobs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-07-02T09:04:04Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T09:50:53Z","closed_at":"2024-07-03T00:23:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35c31722b78ea14e009ff23f21fe30b30cb72981","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47175/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47175/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47175/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f11f316aad12bf984ef4b6101a31b20aaa420710","head":{"label":"codesorcery:SPARK-48710-numpy-upper-bound","ref":"SPARK-48710-numpy-upper-bound","sha":"f11f316aad12bf984ef4b6101a31b20aaa420710","user":{"login":"codesorcery","id":6949483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDk0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6949483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery","html_url":"https://github.com/codesorcery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":819830482,"node_id":"R_kgDOMN2e0g","name":"spark","full_name":"codesorcery/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codesorcery","id":6949483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDk0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6949483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery","html_url":"https://github.com/codesorcery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codesorcery/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/codesorcery/spark","description":"Apache

spark commit task will commit to committedTaskPath\r\n`${outputpath}/_temporary//${appAttempId}/${taskId}`\r\nSo in #36564 's case, since before #38980, each task's job id's date is not the same,  when the task writes data success but fails to send back TaskSuccess RPC, the task rerun will commit to a different committedTaskPath then causing data duplicated.\r\n\r\nAfter #38980, for the same task's different attempts, the TaskId is the same now, when re-run task commit, will commit to the same committedTaskPath, and hadoop CommitProtocol will handle such case then data won't be duplicated.\r\n\r\nNote: The taskAttemptPath is not same since in the path contains the taskAttemptId.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNo need anymore\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

spark commit task will commit to committedTaskPath\r\n`${outputpath}/_temporary//${appAttempId}/${taskId}`\r\nSo in #36564 's case, since before #38980, each task's job id's date is not the same,  when the task writes data success but fails to send back TaskSuccess RPC, the task rerun will commit to a different committedTaskPath then causing data duplicated.\r\n\r\nAfter #38980, for the same task's different attempts, the TaskId is the same now, when re-run task commit, will commit to the same committedTaskPath, and hadoop CommitProtocol will handle such case then data won't be duplicated.\r\n\r\nNote: The taskAttemptPath is not same since in the path contains the taskAttemptId.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNo need anymore\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch makes ii possible to mark scala UDFs as foldable. UDFs marked as foldable will be constant folded when when it is deterministic and all the children are foldable.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBy allowing the expression to be folded we can allow for more optimizations. Zero argument UDFs are commonly used for literals of custom types.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it allows scala UDFs to be constant folded during analysis.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in ConstantFoldingSuite.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to:\r\n- fix some error prompts when `variant` type data is invalid.\r\n- provide a clear `error-condition` for `variant` related errors.\r\n- use `checkError` to check exception in the `VariantSuite` class.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Reproduction examples\r\n  <img width=\"446\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/840690ea-7378-4fd8-a3b3-4459a66f989b\">\r\n\r\n  For reproduction examples detail, please refer to: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47162#issuecomment-2202255944\r\n\r\n- When there is only `value` or `metadata` in `variant` data, it will throw `variant with more than two field`, which is obviously incorrect.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/930422389352b8349e5a845c8cae9993d30dce17/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/ParquetSchemaConverter.scala#L405-L408\r\n\r\n- When `SQLConf.PARQUET_VECTORIZED_READER_ENABLED` is true or false, there is a difference in the error prompt, and we should align it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fix some error prompts when `variant` type data is invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisted UT & Update UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix internal function `_capture_call_site` for filtering out IPython-related frames from user stack.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIPython-related frames are unnecessarily polluting the user stacks so it harms debuggability of IPython Notebook.\r\n\r\nFor example, there are some garbage stacks recorded from `IPython` and `ipykernel` such as:\r\n\r\n- `...lib/python3.9/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py...`\r\n- `...lib/python3.9/site-packages/ipykernel/zmqshell.py...`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the user stack from IPython will be cleaned up as below:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n<img width=\"457\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-01 at 3 26

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move the connect server to builtin module.\r\n\r\nFrom:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconnector/connect/server\r\nconnector/connect/common\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconnect/server\r\nconnect/common\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSo the end users do not have to specify `--packages` when they start the Spark Connect server. Spark Connect client remains as a separate module. This was also pointed out in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39928#issuecomment-1428264541.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users don't have to specify `--packages` anymore.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should verify them.\r\nAlso manually tested several basic commands such as:\r\n\r\n- Maven build\r\n- SBT build\r\n- Running basic Scala client commands\r\n   ```bash\r\n   cd connector/connect\r\n   bin/spark-connect\r\n   bin/spark-connect-scala-client\r\n   ```\r\n- Running basic PySpark client commands\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   bin/pyspark --remote local\r\n   ```\r\n- Connecting to the server launched by `./sbin/start-connect-server.sh`\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ./sbin/start-connect-server.sh\r\n    bin/pyspark --remote \"sc://localhost\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-07-01T02:00:03Z","updated_at":"2024-07-16T10:00:42Z","closed_at":"2024-07-11T00:15:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84acd84aa511855001345766568ed9160d6c6e7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIntroduce ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER BY SQL syntax to change the clustering columns:\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE tbl CLUSTER BY (a, b);  -- update clustering columns to a and b\r\nALTER TABLE tbl CLUSTER BY NONE;  -- remove clustering columns\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change updates the clustering columns for catalogs to utilize. Clustering columns are maintained in:\r\n* CatalogTable's `PROP_CLUSTERING_COLUMNS` for session catalog\r\n* Table's `partitioning` transform array for V2 catalog\r\n\r\nwhich is consistent with CREATE TABLE CLUSTER BY( https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42577).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord
