Driver class is implemeted, which includes the following functions:\n-  Init() to init glogs, gflags (may remove the dependency on flags later); register built-in layers, updaters, etc.; setup folders; init MPI if MPI is used for message passing.\n-  RegisterLayer/Updater/Worker/Param, for registering user defined layers, updaters, etc.\n-  Submit() for submitting the job configuration.\n  The main function calls Driver::Init and Dirver::Submit to launch a training job.\n\nRefactor Param class to clean the code of ParseUpdateMsg and fix the bugs from initializing parameters based on fan in number.  There are many layers using weight matrix, e.g., convolution layer and innerproduct layer. Some initialization methods of the weight matrix are based on the fan-in of the matrix, i.e., the dimension interacts with the other operator. E.g., for v_W, W's fan-in is the number of rows; For v_W^T, W's fan-in is the number of columns. However, the Param::InitValues() method does not know the position (and transposition) of the matrix in the multiplication operation. We have to fix the fan-in dimension. Particularly, we fix it to the second dimension (i.e., number of columns) and assume users use the weight matrix correctly. The current implementation of convolution layer and innerproduct layer have different fan-in dimension, which should be unified to the second dimension. For the convolution layer, its operation is W_v. W's fan-in is already the number of columns. For the innerproduct layer, the current operation is v_W, which should be updated to v*W^T, then the fan-in is the number of

this bug arising from calling Worker::Put() in Worker::InitLocalParam().\nPreviously, the version/step passed to Put() is step_ which starts from ModelProto::step.\nHence, the params in the servers are put with version step_. When the params are load from checkpoint files and their param versions are not reset, then the trainining may get stuck after one iteration. Because if the start step is small (usually 0), parame version at the server side is small (i.e., 0), while the local_version() (assigned from version()) is the one from last checkpoint, which is large. Hence the Worker::Collect() function will get stuck. To fix this bug, just pass the current param->version() to Worker::Put().\n\nUpdate default value for ModelProto::reset_param_version to true. It will reset all parameter version to ModelProto::step. For resuming training from checkpoints, if users do not set it, the Trainer::Resume() function will set it to false. Hence the parameter versions will continue from last checkpoint.\nIf users set it to true, then all parameters will be reset to the version as ModelProto::step.\nIf using the checkpoint as pre-training to initalize new model parameters, users better use the default value (i.e., true), otherwise some parameters' version would be much larger than others.\n","created_at":"2015-07-30T05:54:23Z","updated_at":"2015-08-29T13:38:25Z","closed_at":"2015-08-03T02:39:06Z","merged_at":"2015-08-03T02:39:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"105f071782ea5f8e330f169015d751dc81999ca7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/40/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/40/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/40/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/statuses/a92a1c7786c2f65344f8f3ff1cfc4aa545724b09","head":{"label":"nudles:fixbug-checkpoint","ref":"fixbug-checkpoint","sha":"a92a1c7786c2f65344f8f3ff1cfc4aa545724b09","user":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34988072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk4ODA3Mg==","name":"singa","full_name":"nudles/singa","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nudles/singa","description":"Mirror

ClusterProto and ModelProto are merged into JobProto.\nA SingaProto is added for global singa configuration including zookeeper info, log dir setting. \nFor distributed training, users must configure conf/singa.conf correctly.\n\nThe driver program (i.e., main.cc) cleaned.\n1. Users include singa.h and their own headers the the drvier program.\n2. They prepare the job configuration\n   and singa configuration (may make this transparent to users, e.g., through environment variable, SINGA_HOME).\n3. They register the layers them implemented.\n4. Call the trainer to start the training\n\nAfter linking the driver program with libsinga, users pass the executable to bin/singa-run.sh\ntogether with the workspace where job.conf is stored to submit the job. By default the script will search for the default executable `singa`. Hence for the default driver program, the path to the executable file can be omitted.\n\nSome layers are moved into optional_layer.cc(.h) if they have dependencies on external libs (e.g., lmdb and opencv). If users do not need these layers, they do not need to install the dependencies. TODO update configure script to add these options. USE_OPTIONAL_LAYER controls the compliation of optional_layer.cc(.h).\n\nMove command line argument singa.conf into trainer.cc. Usually, users do not need to pass this argument explicitly. The sing-run.sh script will find it automatically.\n","created_at":"2015-07-23T02:17:17Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T05:59:26Z","closed_at":"2015-07-23T06:49:37Z","merged_at":"2015-07-23T06:49:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"536844acc2b3c568a5eeca25b7ef0bc3910c776a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/37/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/37/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/37/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/statuses/0478e8cfdb54688c7c627cd328af04aa6aa30a63","head":{"label":"nudles:jobconf","ref":"jobconf","sha":"0478e8cfdb54688c7c627cd328af04aa6aa30a63","user":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34988072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk4ODA3Mg==","name":"singa","full_name":"nudles/singa","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nudles/singa","description":"Mirror

ticket is to implement RBM in SINGA.\nTo training RBM models, the Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm should be implemented. \nWe have implemented a BPWorker to run the Back-Propagation algorithm. To implement the CD algorithm, we follow the same way to create a CDWorker whose RunOneBatch function controls the logic of the CD algorithm, including positive phase, negative phase and computing gradient phase.\nRBM's layers are different to the layers for feed-forward neural networks, hence new layers for RBM models should be added.\n","created_at":"2015-07-21T14:37:45Z","updated_at":"2015-07-23T08:24:37Z","closed_at":"2015-07-23T08:24:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99c508689eab2b9b1fb741a44f76608a34d5668e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/36/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/36/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/36/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/statuses/437a4244fa8a6b016ca93a7c372691518d88b9bb","head":{"label":"lzjpaul:feature-paramshare-cleancode","ref":"feature-paramshare-cleancode","sha":"437a4244fa8a6b016ca93a7c372691518d88b9bb","user":{"login":"lzjpaul","id":8807719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDc3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8807719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul","html_url":"https://github.com/lzjpaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35958925,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTk1ODkyNQ==","name":"incubator-singa","full_name":"lzjpaul/incubator-singa","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lzjpaul","id":8807719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDc3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8807719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul","html_url":"https://github.com/lzjpaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lzjpaul/incubator-singa","description":"Mirror

checkpoint is done in the Worker class and controlled by two model configuration fields: checkpoint_after and checkpoint_frequency.\n\nOnly do checkpoint for the Params owning the param values from the first group. The name, version and values of one Param are dumped onto disk (the path is <workspace>/checkpoint/step<training step>-worker<worker id>.bin). It is possible that the snapshot is separated into multiple files because the neural net is partitioned into multi workers.\n\nThe checkpoint files can be used:\n- application 1: to restore (resume) the training by setting the command line argument -resume = true.\n  The Resume function of the Trainer will find the files for the latest snapshot and add them to the model.conf's checkpoint filed. It also set the model config's step field to the snapshot step (extracted from file name).\n- application 2: as the pre-training result of another model. Users have to config the new model's checkpoint field to add the paths of all checkpoint files of the same snapshot.\n\nThe Worker's InitLocalParam will init Param's from checkpoint files if available. Otherwise it randomly init them using user configured init method. It matches the Param objects based on name. If the Param is not configured with a name, NeuralNet class will automatically create one for it based on the name\nof the layer to which the Param belongs. In this case,\n- for application 2, users have to configure the names of the new model params carefully to\n  match the names of params from the pre-trained model\n- for application 1, the worker-server topology cannot be changed.\n\nRestore for params which are partitioned due to model partitioning is not supported.

the synchronous training frameworks, one worker group and one server group are launched.\nGradients for the same Param are aggregated locally at each process's stub.    The server conducts update until receive all gradients for the same Param (slice). After udpate, the server sends back new Param (slice) values to every process who has sent update request.    The worker_shard_ and server_shard consist of ParamEntrys, each of which stores the information of one unique Param (slice), e.g.,    the number of shares of each Param (slice), and the local shares for each Param (slice).\n\nThe Msg class is improved to have clean/simple API. The msg header now includes a src (int), a dst (int) and a trgt (int value and int version),    representing the source addr, destination addr and target of the msg. The address is constructed by the entity who creates the msg. Any addr is valid as long as it is unique for one entity.    Function Addr(int grp, int id_or_proc, int type) is provided to construct the addr using   group ID, worker/server ID (or procs ID) and entity type (kServer, kStub, etc.). Functions are also provided to extract    the group, worker/server ID from the addr (int). Similarly, the target field can be constructed using ParamTrgt function    which wraps the Param ID and Slice ID into a target value (int). ParamID() and SliceID() are to extract the info from target value.\n","created_at":"2015-07-17T08:23:07Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T05:57:03Z","closed_at":"2015-07-18T08:38:46Z","merged_at":"2015-07-18T08:38:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"a6f9db1f58fa164413b3e556cbf9979cc0906760","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/32/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/32/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/32/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/statuses/96bedb2264f7d4ebd8a2a0cad67dc9a91f5419c9","head":{"label":"nudles:feature-synctrain","ref":"feature-synctrain","sha":"96bedb2264f7d4ebd8a2a0cad67dc9a91f5419c9","user":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34988072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk4ODA3Mg==","name":"singa","full_name":"nudles/singa","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nudles/singa","description":"Mirror

ticket is to implement RBM in SINGA.\nTo training RBM models, the Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm should be implemented. \nWe have implemented a BPWorker to run the Back-Propagation algorithm. To implement the CD algorithm, we follow the same way to create a CDWorker whose RunOneBatch function controls the logic of the CD algorithm, including positive phase, negative phase and computing gradient phase.\nRBM's layers are different to the layers for feed-forward neural networks, hence new layers for RBM models should be added.\n","created_at":"2015-06-26T07:36:26Z","updated_at":"2015-07-22T11:26:16Z","closed_at":"2015-07-22T11:26:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c855874e5308eff418ede3f2a7fe8dd6ca09fa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/20/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/20/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/20/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/statuses/49897a7c8ad7bca51a9f5168b3badceef63cecc9","head":{"label":"lzjpaul:feature-DBM","ref":"feature-DBM","sha":"49897a7c8ad7bca51a9f5168b3badceef63cecc9","user":{"login":"lzjpaul","id":8807719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDc3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8807719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul","html_url":"https://github.com/lzjpaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35958925,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTk1ODkyNQ==","name":"incubator-singa","full_name":"lzjpaul/incubator-singa","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lzjpaul","id":8807719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDc3MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8807719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul","html_url":"https://github.com/lzjpaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzjpaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lzjpaul/incubator-singa","description":"Mirror

Param objects in deep learning models are much larger than other Param objects. For example, a weight matrix is usually 100 times larger than a bias vector. The difference in Param size causes two problems,\n1. if there are multiple servers in one server group, then the servers may be assigned different number of parameters to update.\n2. if there are multiple server groups, e.g., in distributed Hogwild framework, then these server groups may be assigned different number of parameters to maintain.\n\nThis ticket its to slice large Param objects to solve the load-balance problem. \nA simple slicing algorithm is used to make it possible to partition all sliced objects into m boxes such that all boxes are assigned similar size of parameters. Because these sliced objects may be partitioned among servers within one group and among server groups,  m is the least common multiplier of nserver_per_group and nsever_groups.\n\nThe slicing algorithm iterates over every box and fills in Param objects if it has enough space. The box capacity is total_param_number/m. But to avoid small slices, it may assign at most m/10 additional space for one box to include a complete Param object. For example, if one box has 100 free space, but the next Param object is 150 and m=1000. In such case, it will put this Param object into the box because 100+1000/10=200>150. Consequently, it avoids slicing a Param object.\n\nThe Param class is updated to include some fields for the slices (one Param object may have multiple slices). The code for workers is almost untouched, but the code for the stub thread has been changed a lot to convert a Param object into multiple slices. The Server treats one slice as a Param object, hence there is not much change for its processing logic except that it has to use the slice ID from a message as Param ID to look up its  param shard.\n","created_at":"2015-06-23T12:44:15Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T05:56:57Z","closed_at":"2015-06-23T14:14:10Z","merged_at":"2015-06-23T14:14:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ea564f4237370994ab068a15a5ad43b3332d261","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/17/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/17/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/17/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/statuses/56d32e8a0dbfa3226053442d6b97602c0e386936","head":{"label":"nudles:feature-sliceparam","ref":"feature-sliceparam","sha":"56d32e8a0dbfa3226053442d6b97602c0e386936","user":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34988072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk4ODA3Mg==","name":"singa","full_name":"nudles/singa","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nudles/singa","description":"Mirror

ConnectStub function wraps the ping-pong messages for connecting worker dealers (including the dealer for transferring parameters and the dealer for transferring features) with the stub router.\nThe bug comes from that we fixed the entity type to kWorkerParam. Consequently, it can only work for one dealer. The other dealer then gets stuck. It happens when we need to transfer features between workers, e.g., model partitioning as shown in the [quick start

to Xuan Liu (from google) for pointing out that the Singleton implementation in SINGA is not thread-safe. Discussions on efficient thread-safe singleton are available at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2576022/efficient-thread-safe-singleton-in-c. \n\nThis pull request updates the utils/singleton.h file to make the two singletons thread-safe.\nIn specific, for the Singleton class, we simple use C++11's static construction as suggested in [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19907903).\nThe ASingleton (constructor with Argument) was used for sharing the Mshadow::Random among Layers and Params. To make it thread-safe, \n1. we change it to TSingleton (Thread specfic singlton).\n2. we add a construtor without arguments for Mshadow::Random which uses a seed generated based on the system clock.\n3. we replace the rand/srand in Mshaodw::Random<cpu> with C++11's random functions, i.e., from random.h\n\nNow each thread will have a separate Mshadow::Random object if it calls TSingleton<Random<cpu>>::Instance() to generate random numbers.\nHence it is thread-safe.\n","created_at":"2015-06-14T08:18:01Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T05:57:30Z","closed_at":"2015-06-15T05:14:47Z","merged_at":"2015-06-15T05:14:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"dcf20c7e182d17c52e42623834994c60dc15c55f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/5/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/5/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/5/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/statuses/eaaf5b81b78cd218ebe8ae879cd57530e13f703a","head":{"label":"nudles:fixbug-singleton","ref":"fixbug-singleton","sha":"eaaf5b81b78cd218ebe8ae879cd57530e13f703a","user":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34988072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk4ODA3Mg==","name":"singa","full_name":"nudles/singa","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nudles/singa","description":"Mirror

support for shared memory Hogwild [1] training in single process (node).\nHogwild training is enabled by setting share_memory to true (i.e., worker groups share memory space for parameter values) in cluster.conf.\nDepending on the configurations of cluster.conf, there are two places to do the update:\n1. if sever_update is true (default) and there is at least one server group, workers send gradients to servers\n   which conduct the update based on sending worker's running iteration.\n2. otherwise, workers update parameters locally.\n\nThe first group conducts the training, validation and test. The training performance is reported periodically for the first group. Validation and test performance is reported immediately. Training performance for other groups are omitted currently.\n\n[1]B.

is a runtime service that manages dynamic configuration and status of the whole cluster.\n\nThe first task for ClusterRuntime is to manage the termination of the singa processes. To stop each process (node), we need to stop both its local workers and servers. For worker threads, they will exit when they finish all training steps. For server threads, they can exit only when all connected workers have stopped.\n\nThe implementation is based on zookeeper. Each process will register server/worker in zookeeper during setup. When a worker finish its execution, it will be de-registered from its server group. Once all workers in a server group leaves, servers will be notified and then they can terminate their service safely.\n","created_at":"2015-05-27T06:32:45Z","updated_at":"2015-06-16T09:10:16Z","closed_at":"2015-05-27T14:39:11Z","merged_at":"2015-05-27T14:39:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"09604860f71a473339d6a82b1362a4f94408013a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/3/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/3/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/3/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/statuses/3921c293f660e9fe69566338dbb99aacb16f6894","head":{"label":"wangsheng1001:feature-zookeeper","ref":"feature-zookeeper","sha":"3921c293f660e9fe69566338dbb99aacb16f6894","user":{"login":"wangsheng1001","id":9816581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTY1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9816581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001","html_url":"https://github.com/wangsheng1001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35159469,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTE1OTQ2OQ==","name":"incubator-singa","full_name":"wangsheng1001/incubator-singa","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangsheng1001","id":9816581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MTY1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9816581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001","html_url":"https://github.com/wangsheng1001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangsheng1001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangsheng1001/incubator-singa","description":"Mirror

are two bugs on ZeroMq:\n1. zsys_init: Assertion `!s_process_ctx' failed\n2. zsock_connect( ) fail for inproc communication\n\nThe first one is caused by multiple threads calling zsys_init function concurrently.  ZeroMQ restricts the order of binding and connect for inproc communication. \nhttp://api.zeromq.org/4-0:zmq-connect says that \"The first exception is when using the inproc:// transport: you must call zmq_bind() before calling zmq_connect().\"\n\nhttp://api.zeromq.org/4-0:zmq-connect says that \"The first exception is when using the inproc:// transport: you must call zmq_bind() before calling zmq_connect().\"\nThe second one is because the endpoint to connect has not bind yet. The comments for zsys_init is as follows,\n//  Initialize CZMQ zsys layer; this happens automatically when you create\n//  a socket or an actor; however this call lets you force initialization\n//  earlier, so e.g. logging is properly set-up before you start working.\n//  Not threadsafe, so call only from main thread. Safe to call multiple\n//  times. Returns global CZMQ context.\nHence, we need to call zsys_init in the main thread before starting sub-threads, e.g., by creating a socket using zsock_new.\n","created_at":"2015-05-26T13:35:26Z","updated_at":"2015-07-30T05:58:57Z","closed_at":"2015-05-26T14:04:21Z","merged_at":"2015-05-26T14:04:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"b143491b46eb2aee177df6da53c538a3acd943a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/2/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/2/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/issues/2/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/singa/statuses/af235456bc348d33502162f2b291557c69662d23","head":{"label":"nudles:fixbug-zsock","ref":"fixbug-zsock","sha":"af235456bc348d33502162f2b291557c69662d23","user":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34988072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk4ODA3Mg==","name":"singa","full_name":"nudles/singa","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nudles","id":3797447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTc0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3797447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles","html_url":"https://github.com/nudles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nudles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nudles/singa","description":"Mirror

training scheme partitions one batch data into sub-batches where each worker in the group process one sub-batch. It is implemented by partitioning the layers (except the data and parser layers) of the original neural network into sub-layers where each sub-layer holds a sub-batch of the features. These sub-layers share the same set of parameter objects. There is one worker who is the owner for each parameter object. Each worker owns a partition of the neural network and computes the gradients of parameters over it.\n\nThe work flow is,\n- Each parameter object is initialized by its owner worker. A put request is then sent to the server by the owner worker.\n- Each worker waits for the fresh parameters and runs the Back-propagation algorithm over its owned partitions (i.e., layers). Once getting the gradients, it send an update message to the main thread (i.e., the stub).\n- The main thread averages the gradients from all workers for the same parameter and sends the update
