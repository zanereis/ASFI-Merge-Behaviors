#29781 \r\n\r\n---\r\nCurrently when we provide `file_pattern` to `SFTPSensor`, it tries to get the first matched file and return `True` when it finds one. But it does the same thing when `newer_than` is provided, so instead of checking if there is at least one file newer than the provided date, it checks if the first matched file is newer than this date.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this bug by getting all the matched files, and returning `True` when there is at least one file newer than the provided

This makes the loading of that view very slow, and it is also not needed, applying the same logic, we only need to retrieve the mapped instances of one of the expansions to get the status of the rest

FIX FOR THE MR: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/27833\r\n\r\n### 1) Handling project location param on async BigQuery dts trigger\r\nCurrently, async version of BigQuery dts operator with trigger cannot be used in other regions except us (default) region.\r\nwhen I used it on another region, trigger task raise error like below.\r\n```\r\nairflow.exceptions.AirflowException: Trigger failed with exception: 404 The requested transfer config (projects/****/locations/us/transferConfigs/*****) was not found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added config param in order to cover all the gcp locations.\r\n\r\n### 2) convert type of field `seconds` to int, if it was str\r\n`requested_run_time` is in the `template_fields` of `BigQueryDataTransferServiceStartTransferRunsOperator`.\r\nbut google python sdk client needs it to be `int` type. so it must be converted to `int` type after task is executed.\r\n```\r\nTypeError: '1676991600' has type str, but expected one of: int\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-27T15:06:31Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T21:51:25Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T21:51:24Z","merged_at":"2023-03-15T21:51:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"5a3be7256b2a848524d3635d7907b6829a583101","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

basic serialization capabilities for the ORM SqlAlchemy models that we use on the client side of the Internal API. Serializing the whole ORM models is rather complex, therefore it seems much more reasonable to convert the ORM models into serializable form and use them - rather than the SQLAlchemy models.\r\n\r\nThere are just a handful of those models that we need to serialize, and it is important to maintain typing of the fields in the objects for MyPy verification so we can allow some level of duplication and redefine the models as pure Python objects.\r\n\r\nWe only need one-way converstion (from database models to Python models), because all the DB operations and modifications of the Database entries will be done in the internal API server, so the server side of any method will be able to use primary key stored in the serializable object, to retrieve the actual DB model to update.\r\n\r\nWe also need to serialization to work both way - an easy way to convert such Python classees to json and back - including validation.\r\n\r\nWe could serialize those models manually, but this would be quite an overhead to develop and maintain - therefore we are harnessing the power of Pydantic, that has already ORM mapping to plain Python (Pydantic) classes built in.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements definition of the Pydantic classes and tests for the classes testing:\r\n\r\n* conversion of the ORM models to Pydantic objects\r\n* serialization of the Pydantic classes to json\r\n* deserialization of the json-serialized classes to Pydantic objects\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

discovered by @uranusjr in other PRs, loading the Metadata info at runtime is surprisingly expensive.\r\n\r\nRecent versions of setuptools (including the one we already say we depend upon in pyproject.toml) have the ability to pull the version from an attribute using an \"ast-eval\" method so this keeps the property of there being a single source of truth for the Airflow version, it just moves that places to airflow/__init__.py.\r\n\r\nYou might wonder why this particular case matters at runtime? In the grand scheme of things it likely doesn't, except that the airflow/operators/python.py imports this at the top level (or did before this PR) which made me look in to it and discover a quick win here.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

decide that solution is too complex to keep it then I am happy to remove the log as well or set a message to \"File has been uploaded.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Google API doesn't return full path of the

only use Connexion's App class to create a Flask Blueprint, so really we can go one level lower and use the FlaskApi interface directly instead.\r\n\r\nConnexion's spec-loading also supports dynamic spec templating via Jinja2, but we don't and CAN'T use it (won't work for any of the OpenAPI clients), so it can be entirely skipped by passing in a pre-loaded dict (instead of a path to the YAML

reads information from the actual installations, which is a lot of IO that we can avoid by caching.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this depends on how many packages you have in your installation. It’s nearly zero with a bare Airflow installation, and I observed a ~7% save (17s to 16s) for the webserver to finish init (launch until `when_ready` is emitted) in a setup with all official providers installed.\r\n\r\nThe downside is we are now persisting a lot of small objects in memory.

PR implements a new `web_identity_token_loader` for the AWS connection `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` authentication mechanism that fetches the access token from a location on the Airflow instance's filesystem.\r\n\r\nThis can be especially useful for Kubernetes environments with the [Service Account Volume Projection](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-token-volume-projection) feature enabled.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the built-in boto mechanism configured through the `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` environment variables but is much more flexible as it can be configured individually at the Airflow connection level.","created_at":"2023-02-20T05:07:37Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T21:16:30Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T18:07:47Z","merged_at":"2023-02-28T18:07:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b36137a31241d0f502604213546b6bf677fea69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Taragolis","id":3998685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTg2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3998685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis","html_url":"https://github.com/Taragolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Taragolis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon
