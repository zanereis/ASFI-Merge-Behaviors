the JIRA ticket here.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-2601)\r\n\r\nThe banner (see `Banner.java`) was being logged twice every time a locator was started up in gfsh. The cause was that both locators (see `InternalLocator.java`) and distributed systems (see `InternalDistributedSystem.java`) contained code to log the banner because previously, it was possible for locators and distributed systems to exist without each other. However, now, since the locators started up by gfsh will always be part of a distributed system, code for logging the banner during locator startup was removed, and code for logging the banner during distributed system startup was retained.\r\n\r\n**_Precheckin status: Completed - mostly green with a few unrelated failures_**\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the JIRA ticket here.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-2936)\r\n\r\n`OrderByComparator.java` contained a lot of redundant and confusing code, as well as somewhat misleading comments (for example, the `compare` method was supposed to throw a `ClassCastException` if the parameters given could not be compared using this comparator, but it didn't. This has been fixed). Code that is shared by both the `compare` and `evaluateSortCriteria` methods has been moved to helper methods to improve readability and reduce redundancy.\r\n\r\n_**Precheckin status**: successful after second round of tests (6/27/17)_\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR is intended for initial review, not to be actively considered for acceptance.  Sufficient testing is still required and `develop` shifted enough today that I need to rebase again.\r\n\r\nThis currently addresses most of the finer-grained security as listed [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Finer+grained+security).

But the new copy of bucket might have not finished initialization yet (because shadow bucket is still initializing), the rebalance will just remove the old bucket. Thus the new primary candidate can never finish initialization. The fix is to wait until new primary exists before remove the old primary's bucket in rebalance.\r\n\r\n2) There's a race condition: data region bucket , 2 colocated child region bucket (one is index region bucket, another one is shadow region bucket for AEQ) did not initialize atomically. The shadow bucket failed to initialize when the remote one is slow to start. When this senario happened, there's no way to create a shadow region bucket later. The fix is to remove the leader bucket if any colocated child bucket failed to initialize. Thus to make sure colocated buckets are initialized atomically. \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

still needs to be done on this change, but wanted to get some eyeballs on the change in parallel.\r\n\r\nThis fix will attempt to push the shadowkey back to the front of the eventSeqNumQueue when we remove the event from the peekedEvents list (this is done when we lose primary for that bucket/event).  That way the event will either be in the eventSeqNumQueue or the peekedEvents at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n@upthewaterspout @boglesby
