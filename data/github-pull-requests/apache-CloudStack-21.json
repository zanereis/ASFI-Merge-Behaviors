Description\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following Guest OS hypervisor mapping improvements.\r\n- Support for the Guest OS / hypervisor mapping addition from upgrade path (using GuestOsMapper)\r\n- Support to copy hypervisor mappings from older version from upgrade path (using GuestOsMapper)\r\n- Provision to validate the OS mapping name in hypervisor when enabled using the new parameter 'osmappingcheckenabled' in addGuestOsMapping API\r\n- Provision to get/check the hypervisor guest OS names (that can be used to add proper mapping) for VMware and XenServer using new API: getHypervisorGuestOsNames.\r\n- Display the Guest OS hypervisor mappings in UI.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #6455 \r\n\r\nThe default storage adaptor - `LibvirtStorageAdaptor` - is used by different storage types and doesn't use the annotation `@StorageAdaptorInfo`. In this case, a storage plugin that wants to adopt one of the predefined storage pool types will override the default behaviour. If fixing the issue in general (for new storage plugins or current ones that want to reuse the existing storage pool types) would affect all volume/snapshot/VM cases. This will lead to the need of extensive testing for each storage plugin for which we don't have the resources to do it. That's why this patch fixes the old behaviour for the SharedMountPoint by adding a new storage pool type for the StorPool plugin.\r\n\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nFew of the smoke tests fail on XCP-ng8 with PV drivers not installed for the VM.\r\nThis PR makes changes to use get_suitable_test_template instead of get_template to use the appropriate template for the VM deployed during the test.\r\nAfter volume migration VM becomes unusable for attach/detach volume action.\r\nA new template could be used in future. For workaround right now, tests are ordered in a way that migrate volume test run at the end.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/6209 where the snapshot revert operation fails after certain volume operations like Migrate VM with volume / migrate volume / reinstall VM.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue after these volume operations, the primary storage entry is getting deleted for that volume. We have fixed it here to get the primary datastore entry wrt volume and continue the operation.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n1.

Marcus Sorensen <mls@apple.com>\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a feature designed to allow CloudStack to manage a generic volume encryption setting. The encryption is handled transparently to the guest OS, and is intended to handle VM guest data encryption at rest and possibly over the wire, though the actual encryption implementation is up to the primary storage driver.\r\n\r\nIn some cases cloud customers may still prefer to maintain their own guest-level volume encryption, if they don't trust the cloud provider. However, for private cloud cases this greatly simplifies the guest OS experience in terms of running volume encryption for guests without the user having to manage keys, deal with key servers and guest booting being dependent on network connectivity to them (i.e. Tang), etc, especially in cases where users are attaching/detaching data disks and moving them between VMs occasionally.\r\n\r\nThe feature can be thought of as having two parts - the API/control plane (which includes scheduling aspects), and the storage driver implementation.\r\n\r\nThis initial PR adds the encryption setting to disk offerings and service offerings (for root volume), and implements encryption support for KVM SharedMountPoint, NFS, Local, and ScaleIO storage pools.\r\n\r\nNOTE: While not required, operations can be significantly sped up by ensuring that hosts have the `rng-tools` package and service installed and running on the management server and hypervisors. For EL hosts the service is `rngd` and for Debian it is `rng-tools`. In particular, the use of SecureRandom for generating volume passphrases can be slow if there isn't a good source of entropy. This could affect testing and build environments, and otherwise would only affect users who actually use the encryption feature. If you find tests or volume creates blocking on encryption, check this first.\r\n\r\n#### Management Server\r\n\r\n##### API\r\n\r\n* createDiskOffering now has an 'encrypt' Boolean\r\n* createServiceOffering now has an 'encryptroot' Boolean. The 'root' suffix is added here in case there is ever any other need to encrypt something related to the guest configuration, like the RAM of a VM.  This has been refactored to deal with the new separation of service offering from disk offering internally.\r\n* listDiskOfferings shows encryption support on each offering, and has an encrypt boolean to choose to list only offerings that do or do not support encryption\r\n* listServiceOfferings shows encryption support on each offering, and has an encrypt boolean to choose to list only offerings that do or do not support encryption\r\n* listHosts now shows encryption support of each hypervisor host via `encryptionsupported`\r\n* Volumes themselves don't show encryption on/off, rather the offering should be referenced. This follows the same pattern as other disk offering based settings such as the IOPS of the volume.\r\n\r\n##### Volume functions\r\n\r\nA decent effort has been made to ensure that the most common volume functions have either been cleanly supported or blocked. However, for the first release it is advised to mark this feature as *experimental*, as the code base is complex and there are certainly edge cases to be found.\r\n\r\nMany of these features could eventually be supported over time, such as creating templates from encrypted volumes, but the effort and size of the change is already overwhelming.\r\n\r\nSupported functions:\r\n* Data Volume create\r\n* VM root volume create\r\n* VM root volume reinstall\r\n* Offline volume snapshot/restore\r\n* Migration of VM with storage (e.g. local storage VM migration)\r\n* Resize volume\r\n* Detach/attach volume\r\n\r\nBlocked functions:\r\n* Online volume snapshot\r\n* VM snapshot w/memory\r\n* Scheduled snapshots (would fail when VM is running)\r\n* Disk offering migration to offerings that don't have matching encryption\r\n* Creating template from encrypted volume\r\n* Creating volume from encrypted volume\r\n* Volume extraction (would we decrypt it first, or expose the key? Probably the former).\r\n\r\n##### Primary Storage Support\r\n\r\nFor storage developers, adding encryption support involves:\r\n\r\n1. Updating the `StoragePoolType` for your primary storage to advertise encryption support. This is used during allocation of storage to match storage types that support encryption to storage that supports it.\r\n\r\n2. Implementing encryption feature when your `PrimaryDataStoreDriver` is called to perform volume lifecycle functions on volumes that are requesting encryption. You are free to do what your storage supports - this could be as simple as calling a storage API with the right flag when creating a volume. Or (as is the case with the KVM storage types), as complex as managing volume details directly at the hypervisor host. The data objects passed to the storage driver will contain volume passphrases, if encryption is requested.\r\n\r\n##### Scheduling\r\n\r\nFor the KVM implementations specified above, we are dependent on the KVM hosts having support for volume encryption tools. As such, the hosts `StartupRoutingCommand` has been modified to advertise whether the host supports encryption. This is done via a probe during agent startup to look for functioning `cryptsetup` and support in `qemu-img`. This is also visible via the listHosts API and the host details in the UI.  This was patterned after other features that require hypervisor support such as UEFI.\r\n\r\nThe `EndPointSelector` interface and `DefaultEndpointSelector` have had new methods added, which allow the caller to ask for endpoints that support encryption.  This can be used by storage drivers to find the proper hosts to send storage commands that involve encryption. Not all volume activities will require a host to support encryption (for example a snapshot backup is a simple file copy), and this is the reason why the interface has been modified to allow for the storage driver to decide, rather than just passing the data objects to the EndpointSelector and letting the implementation decide.\r\n\r\nVM scheduling has also been modified. When a VM start is requested, if any volume that requires encryption is attached, it will filter out hosts that don't support encryption.\r\n\r\n##### DB Changes\r\n\r\nA volume whose disk offering enables encryption will get a passphrase generated for it before its first use. This is stored in the new 'passphrase' table, and is encrypted using the CloudStack installation's standard configured DB encryption. A field has been added to the volumes table, referencing this passphrase, and a foreign key added to ensure passphrases that are referenced can't be removed from the database.  The volumes table now also contains an encryption format field, which is set by the implementer of the encryption and used as it sees fit.\r\n\r\n#### KVM Agent\r\n\r\nFor the KVM storage pool types supported, the encryption has been implemented at Qemu itself, using the built-in LUKS storage support. This means that the storage remains encrypted all the way to the VM process, and decrypted before the block device is visible to the guest.  This may not be necessary in order to implement encryption for /your/ storage pool type, maybe you have a kernel driver that decrypts before the block device on the system, or something like that. However, it seemed like the simplest, common place to terminate the encryption, and provides the lowest surface area for decrypted guest data.\r\n\r\nFor qcow2 based storage, `qemu-img` is used to set up a qcow2 file with LUKS encryption. For block based (currently just ScaleIO storage), the `cryptsetup` utility is used to format the block device as LUKS for data disks, but `qemu-img` and its LUKS support is used for template copy.\r\n\r\nAny volume that requires encryption will contain a passphrase ID as a byte array when handed down to the KVM agent. Care has been taken to ensure this doesn't get logged, and it is cleared after use in attempt to avoid exposing it before garbage collection occurs.  On the agent side, this passphrase is used in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. In cases where the volume experiences some libvirt interaction it is loaded into libvirt as an ephemeral, private secret and then referenced by secret UUID in any libvirt XML. This applies to things like VM startup, migration preparation, etc.\r\n\r\n2. In cases where `qemu-img` needs to use this passphrase for volume operations, it is written to a `KeyFile` on the cloudstack agent's configured tmpfs and passed along. The `KeyFile` is a `Closeable` and when it is closed, it is deleted. This allows us to try-with-resources any volume operations and get the KeyFile removed regardless.\r\n\r\nIn order to support the advanced syntax required to handle encryption and passphrases with `qemu-img`, the `QemuImg` utility has been modified to support the new `--object` and `--image-opts` flags. These are modeled as `QemuObject` and `QemuImageOptions`.  These `qemu-img` flags have been designed to supersede some of the existing, older flags being used today (such as choosing file formats and paths), and an effort could be made to switch over to these wholesale. However, for now we have instead opted to keep existing functions and do some wrapping to ensure backward compatibility, so callers of `QemuImg` can choose to use either way.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that there are also a few different Enums that represent the encryption format for various purposes. While these are analogous in principle, they represent different things and should not be confused. For example, the supported encryption format strings for the `cryptsetup` utility has `LuksType.LUKS` while `QemuImg` has a `QemuImg.PhysicalDiskFormat.LUKS`.\r\n\r\nSome additional effort could potentially be made to support advanced encryption configurations, such as choosing between LUKS1 and LUKS2 or changing cipher details. These may require changes all the way up through the control plane. However, in practice Libvirt and Qemu currently only support LUKS1 today. Additionally, the cipher details aren't required in order to use an encrypted volume, as they're stored in the LUKS header on the volume there is no need to store these elsewhere.  As such, we need only set the one encryption format upon volume creation, which is persisted in the volumes table and then available later as needed.  In the future when LUKS2 is standard and fully supported, we could move to it as the default and old volumes will still reference LUKS1 and have the headers on-disk to ensure they remain usable. We could also possibly support an automatic upgrade of the headers down the road, or a volume migration mechanism.\r\n\r\nEvery version of cryptsetup and qemu-img tested on variants of EL7 and Ubuntu that support encryption use the XTS-AES 256 cipher, which is the leading industry standard and widely used cipher today (e.g. BitLocker and FileVault).\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nHOST DETAILS UI\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-07-01 at 6 24 30 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1047709/176979751-6f58f014-16e5-4ae0-a315-a1f01d2bc460.png)\r\n\r\nCOMPUTE OFFERING MODAL\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-07-01 at 6 23 31 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1047709/176979757-21912267-15af-47ea-ab56-eb00d3971f21.png)\r\n\r\nDISK OFFERING MODAL\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-07-01 at 6 22 56 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1047709/176979766-4ca8bc9b-1642-4e58-89ee-0686a2494fe3.png)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIncluded smoke tests, unit tests, local testing.\r\n\r\nThe majority of testing has been done over time, and prior to the recent major KVM snapshot and service offering changes.

Description\r\nThis is in the workflow of attaching and detaching a root volume of a VM. We can detach the root volume from a VM and Cloudstack marks it as datadisk. We can reattach the volume to make it root volume again. During attach Device ID 0 has to be passed so that the volume will be converted back to ROOT again\r\n\r\nAdded a small information in the DeviceID section in Attach volume form.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe

Description\r\nFixes #6514 \r\n\r\nOn latest systemvm template used for CKS `/usr/sbin` is not present in the `$PATH` for normal user used during upgrade. This leads to failure for `blkid` command. Due to this during k8s version upgrade ISO is not being able to mount on the k8s cluster VMs and upgrade process is not carried out.\r\nThis PR fixes mounting of k8s version ISO and also returns failure for script when ISO mounting is failed.\r\nSame failure is not seen during deployment of the cluster because `setup-kube-system` workflow is executed as ROOT user and it has a different value for $PATH.\r\nFrom `/etc/login.defs`:\r\n```\r\nENV_SUPATH\tPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\r\nENV_PATH\tPATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n\r\nBy deploying a k8s cluster with version 1.23.3 and upgrading it to 1.24.0\r\n\r\nk8s cluster and version\r\n```\r\n(localcloud) 🐱 > list kubernetesclusters filter=id,name,kubernetesversionid,kubernetesversionname,ipaddress\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 2,\r\n  \"kubernetescluster\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"8ee0e819-0a59-4417-ab79-e0daee6bb6d9\",\r\n      \"kubernetesversionid\": \"8429a514-38cb-4c9e-a81c-7d3491ad8f6a\",\r\n      \"kubernetesversionname\": \"v1.23.3\",\r\n      \"name\": \"t1\",\r\n      \"ipaddress\": \"10.0.52.23\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"7684079e-bf0a-4260-8102-57f7cad800cf\",\r\n      \"kubernetesversionid\": \"8429a514-38cb-4c9e-a81c-7d3491ad8f6a\",\r\n      \"kubernetesversionname\": \"v1.23.3\",\r\n      \"name\": \"t2\",\r\n      \"ipaddress\": \"10.0.52.24\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n(localcloud) 🐱 > list kubernetessupportedversions filter=id,name,semanticversion\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 2,\r\n  \"kubernetessupportedversion\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"8429a514-38cb-4c9e-a81c-7d3491ad8f6a\",\r\n      \"name\": \"v1.23.3\",\r\n      \"semanticversion\": \"1.23.3\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"302266c2-6414-467a-97a7-d866d59568d9\",\r\n      \"name\": \"v1.24.0\",\r\n      \"semanticversion\": \"1.24.0\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpgrade k8s cluster t1\r\n```\r\n(localcloud) 🐱 > upgrade kubernetescluster id=8ee0e819-0a59-4417-ab79-e0daee6bb6d9 kubernetesversionid=302266c2-6414-467a-97a7-d866d59568d9\r\n{\r\n  \"kubernetescluster\": {\r\n    \"account\": \"admin\",\r\n    \"associatednetworkname\": \"t1-network\",\r\n    \"autoscalingenabled\": false,\r\n    \"controlnodes\": 1,\r\n    \"cpunumber\": \"4\",\r\n    \"description\": \"t1\",\r\n    \"domain\": \"ROOT\",\r\n    \"domainid\": \"2e8b5f3a-f71a-11ec-87b5-1e0057000461\",\r\n    \"endpoint\": \"https://10.0.52.23:6443/\",\r\n    \"hasannotations\": false,\r\n    \"id\": \"8ee0e819-0a59-4417-ab79-e0daee6bb6d9\",\r\n    \"ipaddress\": \"10.0.52.23\",\r\n    \"ipaddressid\": \"a70d3bdb-892f-42bc-8c47-cb35b31e28ee\",\r\n    \"kubernetesversionid\": \"302266c2-6414-467a-97a7-d866d59568d9\",\r\n    \"kubernetesversionname\": \"v1.24.0\",\r\n    \"masternodes\": 1,\r\n    \"memory\": \"4096\",\r\n    \"name\": \"t1\",\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest upgraded k8s cluster -

Description\r\n\r\nWhile deleting a traffic type, ACS validates if there is any VM related to it. However, if we have several physical networks containing a traffic type, ACS does not filter the physical network to do the validation. For instance, if we have two (2) physical networks containing the traffic type Guest, the first one having VMs related, and the second not having VMs related, if we try to remove the second traffic type, ACS give us the message `The Traffic Type is not deletable because there are existing networks with this traffic type:Guest`.\r\n\r\nThe API `deleteTrafficType` was designed to filter the physical network where the traffic type is, however, due to a typo this filtering was not been applied correctly. This PR intends to fix this typo to honor the API behavior.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn an advanced zone I created 4 physical networks, one for each traffic type (Public, Guest, Management, Storage). I instantiated some VMs so they get guest IPs. In the Public physical network I added a Guest traffic type. I tried to remove the new Guest traffic type from Public physical network, which did not have any VMs related to it, and, before the changes, I was getting the message `The Traffic Type is not deletable because there are existing networks with this traffic type:Guest`. After the changes, I could remove successfully the new Guest traffic type via API deleteTrafficType. I also tried to remove the Guest traffic type which had VMs related to it, however, as expected, I received the `The Traffic Type is not deletable...` message.\r\n\r\nI also created a unit test to validate the data

Description\r\n\r\nThe new release [Libvirt-Java v0.5.3](https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt-java/-/tags/v0.5.3) now supports `virDomainMigrate3`[[1]](https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt-java/),[[2]](https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt-java/-/commit/e45d3fb8bccab2d3048f902f0be74308afc923df), a powerful and flexible _domain migrate_ command in Libvirt. This command allows pointing just the Root volume to be migrated, saving a lot of compute resources, network bandwidth, and time. \r\n\r\nLikely, data disks hold TBs of data, while Root volumes hundreds of GBs. This allows saving crucial time, bandwidth, and processing.\r\n\r\nIt can easily save several hours to offload a KVM machine depending on the amount of VMs to be migrated and data disks attached to the respective VMs.\r\n\r\n[[1] Libvirt-Java](https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt-java/)\r\n[[2] commit that added `virtDomainMigrate3` into the Libvirt-Java](https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt-java/-/commit/e45d3fb8bccab2d3048f902f0be74308afc923df)\r\nFore reference, PR https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/6472 added `libvirt-java v0.5.3` into CloudStack.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nTested migration of VM with local Root (50GB) + data-disk (100GB)\r\n1. As an example, this is a scenario without this PR:\r\n```\r\n~# virsh domjobinfo i-2-345-VM\r\nJob type:         Unbounded   \r\nOperation:        Outgoing migration\r\nTime elapsed:     17063        ms\r\nData processed:   2.938 GiB\r\nData remaining:   147.065 GiB\r\nData total:       150.004 GiB\r\nFile processed:   2.938 MiB\r\nFile remaining:   147.065 GiB\r\nFile total:       150.004 GiB\r\n```\r\n**Data total 150.004  GiB**\r\n\r\n2. When testing the same migration but with the changes of the PR:\r\n```\r\n~# virsh domjobinfo i-2-345-VM\r\nJob type:         Unbounded   \r\nOperation:        Outgoing migration\r\nTime elapsed:

Description\r\nWhen detaching a volume, if the volume is in use inside the VM, the hypervisor waits until it is possible to execute the task. This waiting period causes ACS to interpret that the disk could not be removed and presents an error message to the user. This behavior can generate inconsistencies because the volume detach is performed, but the ACS does not identify this information. If the user requests the volume detach again, a new error message is presented, saying that the volume in question is not contained in the target instance.\r\n\r\nTo work around the situation, the `wait.detach.device` global configuration was created. It determines, in milliseconds, the time ACS will wait before considering the detach command to have failed. The default value of this property is 10000 (10 seconds).\r\n\r\nAlso, changes have been made so that an exception is not thrown when the user tries to remove a volume that is no longer contained in the VM. That way, if the detach command fails to extrapolate the time configured by the `wait.detach.device`, but the volume is still removed from the instance by the hypervisor, the user can later remove it via the UI, without having to stop the VM to perform this procedure.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nA value was defined in the `wait.detach.device` configuration, after that we sent the `detachVolume` command. By watching the Agent log we could see if the command was successful or if the volume was busy during the `detachVolume`; if the Volume was busy, we will wait for the value defined in `wait.detach.device` before assuming that ACS failed to detach the Volume and then we will notify the operators that the volume could not be detached with the message: \"Could not detach volume after sending the command and waiting for [`wait.detach.device` value] milliseconds.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the frequency of execution of the logrotate service, in virtual routers, is defined to be executed every hour, and it is not possible to change this value via ACS.\r\n\r\nThis behavior has been fixed so that the operator is now able to define this interval using the global configuration `router.logrotate.frequency`, which follows the pattern adopted by the onCalendar field of the Systemd Timers tool. Such a pattern uses the format: `[* *-*-* *:*:*]` which means `[<DAY_OF_WEEK> <YEAR>-<MONTH>-<DAY> <HOUR>:<MINUTE>:<SECOND>]`. However, the ACS uses only the last block of this format, that is, `[<HOUR>:<MINUTE>:<SECOND>]`, since the use cases presented show that times greater than 24 hours lead to problems in the VRs resulting from discharge disk space usage.\r\n\r\nThe default value for this setting was kept, being represented by: `*:00:00` (hourly). The table below represents some of the possible values and their meanings:\r\n\r\n\r\n| Valor         | Significado                       |\r\n|---------------|-----------------------------------|\r\n| \\*:\\*:00      |  Every minute                  |\r\n| \\*:\\*/15:00   |  Every 15 minutes                 |\r\n| \\*:00:00      |  Every hour                         |\r\n| \\*/2:00:00    |  Every 2 hours                    |\r\n| 00:00:00      |  Every day at exactly 00:00:00   |\r\n\r\n**Note**: the minimum file size is fixed at 10M, which means that the logrotate service will run, but it will not rotate the log files if it does not reach the minimum size.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x]

Description\r\n\r\nCloudStack has the functionality to upload volumes, templates, and local ISOs. To execute the process, ACS generates a link to the secondary storage (using its public IPs), where the resource must be sent. The *links* are always generated with the HTTPS protocol and the environment has to be configured to handle HTTPS, requiring us to have SSL certificates. However, for environments that do not need to use certificates (such as staging ones), via the UI, we need a workaround (get the URL generated by the API for generating upload links, open it in a new tab, and accept an insecure connection with the application).  \r\n\r\nThe ACS was changed so that it also handles HTTP to upload volumes/images/ISOs according to the global configuration `use.https.to.upload`; then operators can choose whether to use the HTTPS or HTTP protocol to generate upload links. By default (true) HTTPS will be used.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring

Description\r\n\r\nThere is currently no way in ACS to redirect users to external links. To resolve the situation, one new property has been added to the `plugin` component inside `config.json` settings file so that redirects to external links can be defined. The `isExternalLink` property define if the component will be shown as an external link in the top corner of the page, or if it will be treated as a plugin. If the property is omitted the component will be treated as a plugin.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"plugins\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\": \"some testing\",\r\n    \"icon\": \"cloud\",\r\n    \"path\": \"https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.17/\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\": \"Cloudstack\",\r\n    \"icon\": \"myIcons/cloudstach.png\",\r\n    \"path\": \"https://cloudstack.apache.org/\",\r\n    \"isExternalLink\": \"true\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\": \"\",\r\n    \"icon\": \"\",\r\n    \"path\": \"\",\r\n    \"isExternalLink\": \"\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"name\": \"Apache\",\r\n    \"icon\": \"https://www.apache.org/icons/apache.png\",\r\n    \"path\": \"https://apache.org/\",\r\n    \"isExternalLink\": \"true\"\r\n  }\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following rules govern the redirection feature for external links:\r\n    - If the property is not defined, the redirect button will not be displayed to the user;\r\n    - The `path` attribute of the `plugin` component is mandatory in this context, and elements of this property that do not have the `path` attribute or are empty will be disregarded. The `name` and `icon` attributes are optional, if an icon is not defined a default icon will be applied;\r\n    - When the `name` attribute is not set, the `path` will be displayed instead.\r\n\r\nOnce the `name`, `path`, `icon` and `isExternalLink` attributes are informed, two possible behaviors can be observed:\r\n\r\n1. Only one defined element: in this context, a button will be displayed, which, when clicked, will redirect the user to the `path` defined in the `plugin` component;\r\n\r\n![image1](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/92582a0991b079ab177fa65a62273962be4ec995/68747470733a2f2f7265732e636c6f7564696e6172792e636f6d2f73632d636c6f7564732f696d6167652f75706c6f61642f76313635333035313639302f72656c656173652d6e6f7465732f342e31362e302e372d7363636c6f7564732f2532313234362f65787465726e616c2d6c696e6b2d696d6167652d315f78676f72396d2e706e67)\r\n\r\n2.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen the user resizes the page to a certain point, or clicks the button to collapse the side menu, the logo configured in the environment is cropped to fit the size of the menu. The default logo of the ACS has a design in such a way that this behavior does not impact the presentation of the same, which, when cut, becomes a kind of \"mini logo\".  \r\n\r\nAn extension was made to allow the administrator to define a logo for when the side menu is collapsed. In order to customize this behavior, the logo and mini logo properties in the `/usr/share/cloudstack-management/webapp/config.json` configuration file must be changed. These changes need to be performed on all MS nodes in the environment.  \r\n\r\nThe properties referring to this enhancement are presented below, note that other properties of this file were omitted

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no way to migrate running system VMs, using the KVM hypervisor, with volumes; this means, we cannot move their volumes to a new storage pool in runtime. This PR aims to add this feature by altering the behavior of the `migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume` API to support system VMs. Furthermore, the `listVolumes` API was changed to also return system VMs root volumes, to provide easy access to the system VMs volume's UUID to the root admins. For this, a new parameter called `listsystemvms` was added to the `listVolumesCmd`. Moreover, it was added unit test for `MigrateVirtualMachineWithVolumeCmd` class.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the changes made by this feature required some tweaking in the UI as the system VM's volumes were now available. When these volumes were accessed, the path led to `/vm/<vm-uuid>`. However, ACS has a different path to VRs and system VMs resulting in a 404 page. This bug was fixed with the new changes; moreover, it was added a Volumes tab to system VMs and VRs as well.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nVR volume's tab:  \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/188019574-96803c0f-b4cb-49e5-a94f-03f66b39c46e.png)\r\n\r\nSystem volume's tab:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/188019745-dc796283-8aeb-405f-abe3-a18395cf9879.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested on a local lab through CloudMonkey, using the command `migrate virtualmachinewithvolume` with the UUID of a system VM and migrating its volume to another storage pool. The command ran as expected. Furthermore, it was added unit test to verify the API behavior.\r\n\r\nFor the UI, I tried to access the volumes of system VMs and VRs as well as the volumes of user VMs to check if nothing was broken.

Description\r\nIf Linstor protocol is selected it makes no sense to show other\r\nproviders as Linstor only works with the Linstor provider.\r\nAnd also the install wizard doesn't use the correct

don't know how cloudstack's\r\nmerge/PR's work.\r\nBut this should be definitely merged to 4.17.* and main\r\n\r\n<!---

to service offering details, allow details to be provided and\r\ndisplayed.

With Service offering details, any arbitrary values provided can be saved and displayed, which can be used as metadata to tag, classify, or organize offerings by higher level consumers.  With disk offerings, any detail that isn't recognized is ignored, so this PR relaxes that and persists arbitrary details as well.\r\n\r\nNote that with both disk offerings and service offerings, there are a few 'special' detail keys that are marked `display=false` when they are persisted, and this functionality remains intact.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested locally, properly displays arbitrary details and hides the special details that are marked `display=false` when queried as non-admin user.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(localhost) 🐱 > create diskoffering name=test displaytext=test disksize=1 details[0].foo=bar details[0].iopsLimit=200\r\n{\r\n  \"diskoffering\": {\r\n    \"created\": \"2022-06-15T16:29:17+0000\",\r\n    \"details\": {\r\n      \"foo\": \"bar\",\r\n      \"iopsLimit\": \"200\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"disksize\": 1,\r\n    \"displayoffering\": true,\r\n    \"displaytext\": \"test\",\r\n    \"hasannotations\": false,\r\n    \"id\": \"a9787073-4704-4bdc-a03f-69e514b79926\",\r\n    \"iscustomized\": false,\r\n    \"name\": \"test\",\r\n    \"provisioningtype\": \"thin\",\r\n    \"storagetype\": \"shared\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n(localhost) 🐱 > set profile localhost-user\r\nLoaded in-built API cache.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the backup date in Veeam is collected as a `String` and saved as `VARCHAR(255)` in the database, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nWe are proposing with this PR to persist the backup dates as a `DATETIME` object, which will enable us to properly manipulate it, regardless of the date format used in the environment. The UI was also changed to display the complete data format.\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading the DB schema, we delete all backup entries in the DB; these backups are synchronized with Veeam backups by ACS afterwards. In the end, no Veeam backups should be lost. Only dummy backups will be permanently deleted, and since they are not relevant in production, no harm will be caused.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nStorage->Backups\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48719461/174315752-68bb7273-84d9-414d-b742-76611f6315be.png)\r\n\r\nInstances->VM->Backups\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48719461/174315868-6f5e7606-2d39-4cc1-972b-4bc35257d5a6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab, by upgrading the DB schema and then checking if ACS would correctly synchronize with Veeam.

Description\r\n\r\nACL rules are currently not enforced when a Load Balancer is used. When created, ACL rules are implemented in the VR in the FORWARD chain. In order for the LB to work only through the configured IPs, it is necessary to configure the rule in the INPUT chain. However, since all traffic into the VR is being allowed, only forwarding is blocked to the unconfigured IPs.\r\n\r\nTo work around this situation, it is possible to configure LB rules via `createLoadBalancerRule` API. However, the `cidrlist` parameter used to configure the CIDRs that can access the load balancer, had been deprecated in favor of the firewall rule implementation, which is not intuitive and does not support VRs in VPCs. Therefore, the parameter was reimplemented to allow users to create rules in the Load Balancer backend that restrict the access according to the source IP.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nNew unit tests were created.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue #6427 -> SAML request must be appended to an IdP URL as a query param with an ampersand, if the URL already contains a question mark, as opposed to always assume that IdP URLs don't have any query params.\r\nGoogle's IdP URL for instance looks like this: `https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=<ID>`, therefore the expected redirect URL would be `https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=<ID>&SAMLRequest=<SAMLRequest>`\r\n\r\nThis code change is backwards compatible with the current behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug

#6427 \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the redirect URL for SAML authentication while using Google as IdP.\r\n\r\nNote: I could not test my fix because choosing google as idp for a user requires the SSO url which also contains the unique IDP id created by google. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\nSSO URL: https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?dpid={IDP-ID}\r\nEntity ID: https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid={IDP-ID}\r\n\r\nTo set up a custom google saml app requires a google workspace account which was not possible for me to create at the moment.\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nWhen we remove the NIC of a network from a VM and add a new NIC of the same network, we will have two registers in the database for the same VM and network, one of them being marked as `removed`. In API `listLoadBalancerRuleInstances`, specifically in the method `LoadBalancingRulesManagerImpl#listLoadBalancerInstances`, ACS retrieves the instances according to the user's account and the network where the LB is being created; however, it lists all the NICs, even the marked as `removed`, which causes the following error while listing the VMs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-05-16 14:06:32,859 ERROR [c.c.a.ApiServer] (qtp365590665-27:ctx-5ce79f30 ctx-9de90969) (logid:a3518976) unhandled exception executing api command: [Ljava.lang.String;@55d45499\r\njava.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 2 out of bounds for length 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to fix this error by filtering the removed NICs while listing the LB intances.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIn a local lab, I created a VM with a random network. I added a NIC for a specific network (`test`) to the VM. I removed the NIC of network `test` and then added it again. I created a LB rule with this VM.

Description\r\n\r\nPR #5297 introduced the disk-only snapshot feature for KVM, which changed the whole snapshot workflow for KVM. While taking a volume snapshot and the global setting `snapshot.backup.to.secondary` is `true`, ACS will backup the snapshot from the primary storage to the secondary storage. As the disk-only snapshot process generates an external file, the backup process only copies it to the secondary storage.\r\nThe extract snapshot from VM snapshot feature uses the same backup workflow to extract the snapshot from the VM directly to the secondary storage. However, as the process was changed to only copy the file, the following error occurs when trying to extract a snapshot from a VM snapshot:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-05-30 11:55:19,152 DEBUG [kvm.storage.KVMStorageProcessor] (agentRequest-Handler-2:null) (logid:565d35b1) Executing: /usr/share/cloudstack-common/scripts/storage/qcow2/managesnapshot.sh -b i-2-5-VM_VS_20220530114135 -n i-2-5-VM_VS_20220530114135 -p /mnt/3ac1f06a-3f50-3e03-b53e-92faead36a85/snapshots/2/5 -t 248e458e-f2c5-48c3-86bc-5201104a5832 \r\n2022-05-30 11:55:19,155 DEBUG [kvm.storage.KVMStorageProcessor] (agentRequest-Handler-2:null) (logid:565d35b1) Executing while with timeout : 21600000\r\n2022-05-30 11:55:19,167 DEBUG [kvm.storage.KVMStorageProcessor] (agentRequest-Handler-2:null) (logid:565d35b1) Exit value is 3\r\n2022-05-30 11:55:19,168 DEBUG [kvm.storage.KVMStorageProcessor] (agentRequest-Handler-2:null) (logid:565d35b1) ***Failed to backup snapshot i-2-5-VM_VS_20220530114135, undefined type i-2-5-VM_VS_20220530114135\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the VM snapshot is internal, the backup workflow has to be different. This PR address the fix for the situation, by using the previous backup workflow when a snapshot is being extracted from a VM snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab I created a VM and took a VM snapshot.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently it is not possible to create CPU-capped SSVMs or CPVMs, even if the system offering used by these system VMs has this enabled. This is due to the fact that, when creating and persisting SSVMs and CPVMs in the database, the CPU cap configuration of the system offering is not being respected and the value false is always used for the CPU usage limitation option. This behavior has been corrected, so that it is now possible to deploy a CPU-limited SSVM or CPVM, according to the settings of the system offering.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the standard system offerings for System VMs has been updated so that the CPU cap is enabled, as keeping system VMs without CPU usage limits opens up space for different types of infrastructure attacks/misuses.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n###

] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTo test this patch, I ran the SQL script, then checked the DB to see if everything is as expected; then, I recreated the SSVM and CPVM and checked if they were configured with CPU limits.\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-30T12:25:07Z","updated_at":"2022-06-24T19:56:29Z","closed_at":"2022-06-24T19:56:29Z","merged_at":"2022-06-24T19:56:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"8448fe27a617b9d3c8e69cc789f3bf009750e3af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073307,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMzMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:secondary-storage","name":"component:secondary-storage","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073449,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM0NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:ssvm","name":"component:ssvm","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6420/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6420/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/6420/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/162899de9128482f5be9b528324a784317d0bd43","head":{"label":"scclouds:enable-cpu-cap-for-SVMs","ref":"enable-cpu-cap-for-SVMs","sha":"162899de9128482f5be9b528324a784317d0bd43","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache
