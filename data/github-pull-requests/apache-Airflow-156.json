Remove dag file parsing in `airflow tasks run --local` process**\r\n\r\n1. Read serialized dag in `airflow tasks run --local` process\r\n2. Add dag file parsing to `fork` in the `TaskRunner` since `airflow tasks run --local` process won't parse the dag_file\r\n\r\n**2. Move callbacks from `airflow tasks run --local` process to `airflow tasks run --raw` process.**\r\n\r\n1. After the AIP 45, the `airflow tasks run --local` process won't parse the dag file,  thus callbacks cannot be run in the `airflow task run --local` process. \r\n4.  Running callbacks in the `airflow tasks run --local` is not secure, when there is run_as_user for the task, the process owner of the `airflow tasks run --local` is `sudoable`, so the callbacks of the task are run by the sudoable user not the task's run_as_user.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

version 3.1.2 requires PyJWT>=2.3.0 which clashes with Flask App\r\nBuilder where PyJWT is <2.0.0 Actually GitHub3.1.0 already introduced\r\nPyJWT>=2.3.0 but so far `pip` was able to resolve it without getting\r\ninto a long backtracking loop and figure out that github3 3.0.0 version\r\nis the right version similarly limiting it to 3.1.2 causes pip not to\r\nenter the backtracking loop. Apparently when there Are 3 versions with\r\nPyJWT>=2.3.0 (3.1.0, 3.1.1 an 3.1.2) pip enters into backtrack loop and\r\nfails to resolve that github3 3.0.0 is the right version to use.\r\nThis limitation could be removed if PyJWT limitation < 2.0.0 is dropped\r\nfrom FAB or when pip resolution is improved to handle the case, The\r\nissue which describes this PIP behaviour and hopefully allowing to\r\nimprove it is tracked in https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10924.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

think we can call this attribute `dag_run_id` without suffering too much ambiguity, principally because _dag_ does  not, strictly speaking, have a `run_id`; it's the dag _run_ that has a `run_id`.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, the codebase has used `dag_run_id` or \"dagrun id\" to refer to the dagrun.run_id column.\r\n\r\nAs of recently, we now have `dagrun_id` alongside `dag_run_id` -- the former is supposed to refer to `DagRun.id` and the latter to `DagRun.run_id`.  But personally I think that retains too much ambiguity.  When reading it, you're not sure if it maybe is just a typo, or what exactly it is / how it is different from dag_run_id.  And it doesn't obey standard camel-to-snake conversion.\r\n\r\nI think we can do a better job of reducing ambiguity by using, wherever possible, `run_id` to mean `DagRun.run_id` and `dag_run_id` to mean the integer PK. (i don't think we have to resort to the painfully verbose `dag run run id`).\r\n\r\nSo, this PR hopes to rename `dagrun_id` to `dag_run_id`, and tries to replace any old references to \"dag run id\" to simply \"run id\".\r\n\r\nThe one wrinkle is the API.  There are references to \"dag_run_id\".  What I've done here is leave that alone.  We could think  of the DagRun.id as internal, and not user-facing from the rest API perspective.  We could consider deprecating / renaming this param, but I'm considering that out of scope since it's already been out there and is unaffected by the recent changes (which this PR hopes to address before they go out in 2.3.\r\n","created_at":"2022-02-24T21:55:20Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T17:56:00Z","closed_at":"2022-03-02T19:03:19Z","merged_at":"2022-03-02T19:03:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"42e2b801fe4cdb9e6fcff3c53b7d732bde59282b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_

PR addresses two bugs concerning dag level access permissions.\r\n\r\n1.  Dag level permissions are not checked properly if a post request is sent from within the web ui (i.e. clear a task or dag run). If a user has can_read on any dag any operation that involves a post request is allowed even though the user does not have the can_write permission for this dag as far as the appropriate other permissions like edit_task_instance or edit_dag_run were granted. This is caused by the dag_id being extracted from `request.args` which only exists for get requests (i.e. change the status of a task). Otherwise `None` is used as dag_id in `appbuilder.sm.check_authorization` which essentially leads to ignoring the dag level access permissions.\r\n2. The inheritance of dag level access permissions for subdags makes dag level (edit) access unusable for any dag that contains a dot in its id. Consider two dags `A` and `A.B` where the later is not a subdag. The current implementation makes it impossible to define dag level access permissions for `A.B`. Instead the dag level permissions of `A` are silently applied to `A.B`. I couldn't find any hint in the documentation that either addresses this behaviour nor states that you can or sould not use a dot in the dag id.\r\n\r\n**Concerning 1.**\r\nWe changed the extraction of dag_id from the request object to first try the query string, then the form data and lastly the json body if it exists.\r\n\r\n**Concerning 2.**\r\nWe removed the special logic of splitting the dag id after the first dot. \r\nThis essentially removes the dag level permission inheritance for subdags in favour of enabling dag level access permissions for all dags with dots in its ids. Since we could not think of an easy way to enable both and subdags are considered deprecated, as far as we understood, we think this to be the more sustainable version.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last let me thank you all for your great work and this outstanding piece of

testing the RC for 2.2.4, the `multiple_outputs` inference did not function correctly when a `@task` decorator was simply \"called\" or had args passed.\r\n\r\nFor example, given the below task definition, we should expect `multiple_outputs` to be True and `XComs` to unroll into separate keys.\r\n```python\r\n    def do_stuff():\r\n        return {\"First\": 1, \"Second\": 2}\r\n    \r\n    @task()\r\n    def call_task_dec() -> Dict:\r\n        my_stuff = do_stuff()\r\n        return my_stuff\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately this does not occur:\r\n<img width=\"658\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48934154/155414911-96849f67-4948-4e21-a809-f656446bea37.png\">\r\n\r\nHowever, when testing this on `main` the `multiple_outputs` inference does function as expected:\r\n<img width=\"672\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48934154/155415051-2c1848c6-450f-4adb-9d65-a081a37ee8d6.png\">\r\n\r\nWhile this behavior is not a regression since I confirmed the inference in this scenario _does not_ work as well in 2.2.3, cherry-picking the `main` changes would not be trivial since this logic was refactored.\r\n\r\nA [discussion](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/21669#issuecomment-1048160108) on this can be found in the RC testing issue.\r\n\r\nIn order to guard against future regressions, this PR adds some unit tests to ensure the inference works as expected when invoking a decorator's `__call__()` method.\r\n\r\nHappy to hear any feedback on possibly parameterizing these tests as well to decrease some duplication.\r\n\r\nCC: @jedcunningham \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

are a few high-level questions for this integration.\r\n\r\n**1. How to implement this hook?**\r\nThe first way is similar to PubSubHook when all functionality is in the hook. Like `PubSubHook.publish()`.\r\nThe second way is similar to FirehoseHook when the hook is just a wrapper of the `boto` client which is used to interact with Kinesis.\r\nTalking about the Apache Pulsar (#21618), it has a good client that manages and reuses sessions for producers and consumers. That's why for Pulsar second way is better.\r\nBut for Kafka, there are a few separate classes for producer and consumer.\r\n\r\n**2. What python package to use?**\r\nThe [kafka-python](https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python) is more popular, but there are no new commits last 2 years.\r\nOn the other hand, [confluent-kafka-python](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python) is actively developing but\r\n less popular and developing by Confluent company.","created_at":"2022-02-23T17:14:07Z","updated_at":"2022-07-10T00:14:43Z","closed_at":"2022-07-10T00:14:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e550fbc961f8916942ec9d7c8f70ade4be3a3238","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale PRs per the .github/workflows/stale.yml policy file"},{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

PR fixes the issue that occurs in the `BigQueryCreateEmptyDatasetOperator` when the BigQuery client can't infer the Google Cloud project_id from the environment or the credentials, in which case the user provides the project_id as an argument to the operator.\r\n\r\nIt is fixed by adding the project_id as an argument to the BigQuery client when it's called from `airflow.providers.google.cloud.hooks.bigquery.BigQueryHook.create_empty_dataset`. This is on par with how the rest of the BigQuery hook's methods call the client, but it was originally omitted from the `create_empty_dataset` method.\r\n\r\ncloses: #21600\r\nrelated:

PR fixes the incorrect first run of data_interval_start after\r\nchanging the scheduling time.\r\n\r\nNew version of the timetables issue\r\n\r\neg:\r\nAt first I had a scheduling time of 30 * * * * *\r\nAfter running it twice, I changed it to 32 * * * *\r\nThe actual first run time after the change is fine, but because the data interval starts from the end of the previous interval, it has already been determined and not refreshed, so the displayed execution_date is incorrect.   This can cause problems with Cross-dag dependencies.\r\n\r\n![2022-02-15_23-34](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55907021/154095279-27cf10cf-04d2-4849-a1a5-0ecbab92e19e.png)  |  ![2022-02-15_23-36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55907021/154095460-fea4fe68-8bbb-45ff-96c7-ec28c42cbfbe.png)\r\n--- | ---\r\n\r\nCorrect:\r\n![2022-02-15_23-26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55907021/154099117-78bb4fe1-9c14-4073-905f-3dc6493ef27f.png)  | ![2022-02-15_23-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55907021/154099134-697d9ad3-6f4d-48b9-af51-fd93f8a18df9.png)\r\n--- | ---\r\n\r\nMy current solution is to add `start = self._get_prev(end)` below `end = self._get_next(start)` to reset data_interval_start.\r\nI'm not sure if this is appropriate :smiley:\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
