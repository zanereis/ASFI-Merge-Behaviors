The arrival time might not always be the right representation of the event time. Also, as the per current logic, the end user of the IO cannot control watermark computation in any way.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses these concerns through an interface `KinesisWatermarkPolicy`, through which an end user can provide custom watermark computation logic. I have also provided some standard watermark policies:\r\n    - Arrival time policy: takes arrival time of the kinesis record as the event time\r\n    - Processing time policy: returns`Instant.now()` as the current watermark \r\n    - Custom watermark policy: which takes a `SerializableFunction` to extract an event time from the record.\r\n    I have used a configurable watermark idle duration threshold for watermark computation. The watermark should be advanced once a watermark has not been updated for the threshold duration. This prevents the stalling of a watermark (in the event that a shard is stalled/down).\r\n\r\nPlease review @iemejia @aromanenko-dev \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

PR implements the Gradle task `:beam-sdks-python:sparkValidatesRunner`, but it doesn't actually run it anywhere.\r\n- All the tests I expected to pass are passing (ran 33 tests, skipped 12), with the exception of `test_external_transforms` [BEAM-7232](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7232); not sure what's up with that one.\r\n- I had to set `beam.spark.test.reuseSparkContext=true` to prevent Spark contexts from being reused, probably because of some concurrency issue.\r\n\r\nR: @angoenka @mxm \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

Seemingly, there has never been a different implementation so probably on some rebase on the to be merged branch things got messed up. see [1] and [2]\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/12abb1b02246b8d36021c7b1a970daf1b64ba4b9#diff-68ed88cc25171e30985dda4534e68c9b\r\n12abb1b02246b8d36021c7b1a970daf1b64ba4b9\r\n\r\n[2] https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/3bcb6f46ad0ae483d1d8785edc2d9d5846c71a73#diff-68ed88cc25171e30985dda4534e68c9b\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to solve the problem with \"Multiple tests fail with a generator StopIteration error on Python 3.7\". The solution is based upon using a for loop instead of next where \"The for loop listens for StopIteration explicitly.\" Please see this answer for a good explanation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14413969/why-does-next-raise-a-stopiteration-but-for-do-a-normal-return Also of interest is the following:  Change StopIteration handling inside generators https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479/. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

ProtoCoder was unable to handle DynamicMessage as it was unable to\r\nget a message specific parser. The Coder is expanded to handle\r\nDynamicMessage as a special case. It stores the complete descriptor set\r\nwhen (de)serializing.\r\n\r\nDesign decision: Although DynamicMessage could in theory have a\r\ndifferent schema per message in a single stream this doesn't make sense.\r\nThe common use-case for using DynamicMessages is when the schema is not\r\nknown at compile type, but is known at pipeline build time (example,\r\nlike pulled from a schema registry).\r\n\r\nWith this restriction we only need to store the schema (or descriptor)\r\nonce when the pipeline is serialized and send to the workers.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

issue I tried to fix with #8396 can be solved by this PR. The problem was that `Read` transform which generates any other types than those covered by standard coders causes `ClassCastException`. Currently, `Read` transform is handled by `FlinkRunner` itself and `WireCoder` for runners only allows length-prefixed byte array coder for all non-standard types. We can fix `ClassCastException` by substituting `Read` transforms with `Impulse+DoFn` as we do in `PortableRunner`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

ticket for the SMB work.\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort-merge_join\r\n\r\nBEAM issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6766\r\n\r\ncc: @nevillelyh , @reuvenlax , @kanterov \r\n\r\nThis is a first pass that successfully runs on DataflowRunner with test input. There are a few To-Do items listed below, as well as much more thorough/modular unit tests to write, but we wanted some feedback on this initial design before continuing.\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n- [ ] support compression\r\n- [x] decouple intermediate layer e.g. `Metadata`, `FileOperations`, `BucketedInputIterator` for easy testing\r\n- [x] work around `JsonSubTypes` limit in `BucketMetadata`\r\n- [ ] reuse temp directory logic in `FileBasedSink`\r\n- [ ] reuse file handling logic in `FileBasedSink`\r\n- [x] support mixing sources of different number of buckets\r\n- [ ] how to provide better hints to auto-scaling so runners can pick better initial `numWorkers` instead of one\r\n- [ ] Cleanup temp files after failed writes\r\n- [x] (Potentially) Option to shard files per bucket based on a target file byte size, in case of unexpectedly skewed bucket sizes.\r\n- [ ] Make Iterables in `SMBCoGbkResult` truly lazy\r\n- [ ] Support nullable keys, with the assumption most users won't be interested in including them in the join results (some options: 1) write all nulls to a separate bucket, easy to ignore at join time; 2) don't write to a separate bucket, but include a \"allowNullableKeys\" field in `BucketMetadata` to identify whether keys are encoded with `NullableCoder` or not; 3) wrap all keys in `NullableCoder`. We're leaning toward (1). )\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

several places we make assumptions that `fieldIdsAccessed` returned a Set with the same iteration order as `getFieldsAccessed`, but this is not the case. Most notably this resulted in an error in `CoGroupTest` when joining by multiple keys. This bug could cause the pipeline to return results with (country, user) rather than (user, country).\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `fieldIdsAccessed` collect field ids into a List instead to maintain the original order.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

LengthPrefixCoder from the key because we do not store\r\nthe key in a nested context where we might need the length prefix.\r\n\r\nThis also expands the state cleanup tests to further verify that state is\r\ncleaned up correctly.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang |

standard Go error functionality (`errors.New` and `fmt.Errorf`) to use the newly added Beam \"errors\" package. This PR covers the following subdirectories under `sdks/go/pkg/beam`: `io`, `options`, `provision`, and `runners`.\r\n\r\nI tried to keep the actual changes as straightforward as possible:\r\n\r\n1. If a call isn't wrapping another error, replace it with `New` or `Errorf`. This should be functionally identical.\r\n2. If a call is wrapping another error, replace it with either `Wrap` or `WithContext` using my best judgement. I generally used `Wrap` when the wrapped error originates from third-party code (i.e. any non-Beam package), and I tried to use `WithContext` otherwise.\r\n3. `WithContext` messages make the most sense in present tense (e.g. \"doing foo\", \"reading bar\"). This means I had to adjust some messages slightly, as little as I could without losing any useful information.\r\n\r\nOnly PR left after this is for the `core` subdirectory. That one might be a bit large so I wanted to separate it.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

initial version of Google Cloud Bigtable IO connector. ~The connector implements BigtableSource() class as the BoundedSource, using LexicographicKeyRangeTracker() class as the corresponding RangeTracker.~ At this stage, the table is read as a whole. The two supplementary files, 'bigtableio_test.py' and 'bigtableio_it_test.py', provide the code for unit and integration tests, respectively.\r\n\r\n_Note about the unit test: As the evidence suggests, the assert_split_at_fraction_exhaustive() function of 'source_test_utils.py' fails to work properly with the LexicographicKeyRangeTracker() class. Patching the 'source_test_utils.py' eliminated some but not all of the errors. Since all the other tests are passed, including the integration test, and the issue seems to be unrelated to the BigtableSource() code, it was decided to temporarily bypass the test_dynamic_work_rebalancing() function until the 'source_test_utils.py' is fully debugged._\r\n\r\n_Note about the integration test: The test script requires certain command line arguments. Refer to 'bigtableio_it_test.py' for more specifics._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

changes are related to the difference in the typing module. In short the issubclass  is removed for typing after python 3.5 and thus this needs to be handled. For more information about the difference and change in typing see:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42027923/mypy-differences-in-isinstance-and-issubclass-from-python-3-5-to-3-6-in-paramete\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/python/typing/issues/136\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish the same behaviour as issubclass did for beam, python2 in python3  the attribute .\\_\\_origon\\_\\_ is used for some of the data structures, see below. Using .\\_\\_origin\\_\\_  result in that both parent and derived is evaluated as subclass of each other. To solve this the attribute .\\_\\_args\\_\\_ is used,  _\\_args\\_\\_ gives the arguments of the typing object. For further information see:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/48572831/how-to-access-the-type-arguments-of-typing-generic\r\n\r\nThe comparison is splited in the following cases:\r\n\r\n- evaluation of typing.[Dict,List,Set,Tuple], there are some special handling of Namedtuples(which is based upon the original code). The evaluation for these types are done using .\\_\\_orign\\_\\_ in order to also check the parent vs derived the attribute .\\_\\_args\\_\\_ are used to check for arguments\r\n- union evaluation of typing.Union, this case is different in the sense that typing.Union.\\_\\_origin\\_\\_ result in attribute error. However for example typing.Union[int, typing.List[int]].\\_\\_origin\\_\\_ gives typing.Union therefore the comparison is: derived.__origin__ is parent \r\n- any is compared using type\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a Flink checkpoint is taken, the current bundle is finalized. The\r\nfinalization happens when the checkpoint barrier has already been sent\r\ndownstream; emitting elements at this point would violate the checkpoint barrier\r\nalignment.\r\n\r\nWhen elements are emitted during checkpointing they are buffered until the\r\ncheckpoint is complete. We should ensure that they are keyed correctly and\r\nemission of the buffered elements does not interfere with any concurrent state\r\nrequests (in case of portability).\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

standard Go error functionality (`errors.New` and `fmt.Errorf`) to use the newly added Beam \"errors\" package. This PR covers the following subdirectories under `sdks/go/pkg/beam`: `artifact`, `testing`, `transforms`, and `util`.\r\n\r\nI tried to keep the actual changes as straightforward as possible:\r\n\r\n1. If a call isn't wrapping another error, replace it with `New` or `Errorf`. This should be functionally identical.\r\n2. If a call is wrapping another error, replace it with either `Wrap` or `WithContext` using my best judgement. I generally used `Wrap` when the wrapped error originates from third-party code (i.e. any non-Beam package), and I tried to use `WithContext` otherwise.\r\n3. `WithContext` messages make the most sense in present tense (e.g. \"doing foo\", \"reading bar\"). This means I had to adjust some messages slightly, as little as I could without losing any useful information.\r\n\r\nThis isn't the complete change of course. I still have other subdirectories to go through and change. But I wanted to try to keep each PR somewhat short since they can be merged independently and I don't want to have a really long, repetitive PR to review.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
