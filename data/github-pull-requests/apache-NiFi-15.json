Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12666) Corrects the NiFi Registry Data Source Configuration, which inadvertently defaulted to H2 memory-backed storage following an upgrade to Spring Framework 6.1. This change is present on the main branch, but does not impact any released versions.\r\n\r\nThe changes remove the `ConditionalOnProperty` annotation, which did not function as intended based on NiFi Registry property loading. The new annotation supports overriding the Data Source in test classes, but otherwise uses standard NiFi Registry properties.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

initial theming of nifi leveraging Angular Material themes and following the Material Design spec. The Canvas, Codemirror, Angular Material components, as well as our custom components have **ALL** been themed.\r\n\r\nTo change the theme open the `nifi-web-fronted/pom.xml` and update the theme to 'purple' by setting the `frontend.theme` maven variable to:\r\n\r\n`<frontend.theme>purple</frontend.theme>`\r\n\r\nThen run a full build with:\r\n\r\n`mvn -T 2 install -DskipTests -P\\!minify-and-compress,avoid-archive-formats,include-new-ui`\r\n\r\nand visit https://localhost:8443/nf/# to see the new purple theme!\r\n\r\nTo develop a new theme create your theme file in `nifi-web-frontend/src/main/nifi/src/assets/themes/`. Each theme file should define each of the variables for each of the primary, accent, and warn color palettes. Once this new theme file has been created it can be referenced as the value for `frontend.theme`.\r\n\r\nThe theme may also be changed outside of a full build in order to support fast developer cycles when designing a new theme. To do so `npm run start` and visit the new UI. Notice that the original NiFi theme is still applied even though we built with the 'purple' theme above. This is because the angular dev server is running in the src/ not in the target/ so in this location the 'purple' theme file has not overwritten the 'nifi' theme file. Now, to change to the 'purple' theme in `nifi-web-frontend/src/main/nifi/src/styles.scss` edit line #75 from:\r\n\r\n`@import 'assets/themes/nifi';`\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n`@import 'assets/themes/purple';`\r\n\r\nor if you have created your own theme file you could include that and see your custom theme applied.\r\n\r\nPlease note that for this initial effort the birdseye, default label color, and default processor fill color have **not** been included in the theming.

The default behaviour is upload from flowfile content to be backward compatible. This can be overridden if the `RESOURCE_TRANSFER_SOURCE` property value is set to `FILE_RESOURCE_SERVICE`, and a `FileResourceService` controller service is registered.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12643](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12643)\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

I duplicated some code that coupled the *FTP and *SFTP processors in order to decouple them.\r\nI think there might be some room for improvement regarding both de-duplication and usage of newer Java APIs, but assumed it makes sense to separate the initial extraction and further refactorings into multiple pull-requests.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to

This will enable UI users to see a list of their established rules and violations (scoped to the currently selected Process Group in the canvas). I'm not sure how this will translate over to the new UI work that's currently in-progress, but I'll gladly take responsibility for adding it there as well.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12640](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12640) Moves the `servlet-api` and `jetty-schemas` JAR libraries from the root `lib` directory to the `nifi-jetty-bundle` NAR.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-3694](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3694) Moved these libraries to the root `lib` directory due to Logback `ServletContextInitializer` issues with Jetty 9.\r\n\r\nJetty 12 has different behavior that avoids startup failures related to `ServletContainerInitializer` implementations, instead logging an informational message. NiFi already disables the Logback `ServletContainerInitializer` using an environment variable, so it is not required for any logging operations.\r\n\r\nMoving the `servlet-api` and `jetty-schemas` JAR libraries to `nifi-jetty-bundle` maintains their position at the effective root of the NAR Class Loading hierarchy while keeping them packaged in the Jetty NAR.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

The method `asDescribedValue` was introduced recently and hasn't been part of a proper release yet. I think its a good time to align the type and naming scheme with the configuration site before the inclusion in a first release, as it would be a breaking change then.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Created a dedicated bundle of all Jolt related software\r\n   - The new structure is the top level directory named nifi-jolt-bundle with sub  directories\r\n\t\t- nifi-jolt-processors\r\n                - nifi-jolt-transform-json-ui\r\n                - nifi-jolt-utils (instead of nifi-standard-utils)\r\n                - nifi-jolt-nar\r\n   - The JoltTransformJSON and JoltTransformRecord record processors were moved under one module nifi-jolt-processors.\r\n   - The TransformFactory which was duplicated originally in the original modules for JoltTransformJSON and JoltTransformRecord is no longer duplicated and is found in nifi-jolt-utils.\r\n   - Common code between JoltTransformJSON and JoltTransformRecord was pulled up to an abstract class AbstractJoltTransform and contains:\r\n     - Definitions of common properties\r\n     - Instantiation of a specs cache.\r\n     - Retrieval from cache\r\n     - custom validate\r\n   - Defined strings representing the various types of Jolt transforms in one place in the JoltTransformStrategy enum. This allows for their use with a common enum across the nifi-jolt-utils (in TransformFactory) module and the nifi-jolt-processors module (AbstractJoltTransform).\r\n   \r\n - Upgraded the JUnit tests with JUnit 5 features e.g.\r\n   public class, non public test methods and the use of assertThrows instead\r\n   of try catch statements. Also upgraded to Java 21 features e.g. Files.readString\r\n - In TestJoltTransformJSON removed duplicate instation of processor and testrunner in each test method and placed in setUp method annotated with Jupitor Junit BeforeEach.\r\n - Removed the duplicate Jolt specs and placed the common ones in a directory so both tests can share them.\r\n - In TestJolTransformRecord replaced the hard coded string for pretty print with the JsonRecordSetWriter.PRETTY_PRINT_JSON property.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9458](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9458) Replaces direct use of [java.text.SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html) with [java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html) across component utilities and test classes.\r\n\r\n`SimpleDateFormat` handles parsing and formatting instances of [java.util.Date](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html) but it lacks features such as nanosecond precision, and can be subject to subtle conversion issues with time zone offsets.\r\n\r\n`DateTimeFormatter` provides parsing and formatting for newer `java.time` classes, which provide greater precision than other types like `java.sql.Time` and `java.sql.Timestamp`.\r\n\r\nPattern characters for `DateTimeFormatter` are largely similar to `SimpleDateFormat`, with several additional characters supporting nanoseconds and optional boundaries. Some formatting patterns are more strict, which could lead to parsing failures on some existing custom formats. This is a primary reason for including these changes as part of the NiFi 2.0 release version.\r\n\r\nFunctional changes include removing date and time handling methods from the `DataTypeUtils` class and adding new `FieldConverter` implementations in the same `nifi-record` module. The new `StandardFieldConverterRegistry` provides an abstraction for retrieving registered instances of `FieldConverter` based on the expected output field type. The `FieldConverter` interface approach provides a more maintainable and focused approach to object conversion while the `FieldConverterRegistry` provides a similar level of reference convenience. Instances of `DateTimeFormatter` are thread-safe, unlike `SimpleDateFormat`, which enables instance caching inside the `StandardFieldConverterRegistry`.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

second mode of \"Track Last Listing Time\" to the existing \"Track Entity Timestamp\".\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12595](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12595)\r\n\r\nBeside the added test code, I did a manual test of the exemplary integration in `ListSFTP`, which worked as intended, as far as I could see; listing all files regardless of their modified time, keeping track of them as long as they're listable from source (+ time window), listing them again once they couldn't be seen for one whole time window or were modified while being tracked. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12591](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12591) Upgrades Swagger Annotations dependencies and references from 1.6.12 to 2.2.20.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade aligns component class and property annotations with the Swagger Plugin configuration already implemented supporting OpenAPI 3.0.\r\n\r\nFor both NiFi and NiFi Registry, the changes support complete API response definitions for all REST Resource classes.\r\n\r\nThe most visible change is the NiFi REST API documentation, which now uses the standard HTML template from the [Swagger Codegen Maven Plugin](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/v3.0.52/modules/swagger-codegen-maven-plugin) together with custom CSS. This change aligns both the NiFi and NiFi Registry REST API documentation using the same approach. The rendered HTML shows all methods and object definitions in a single HTML page, instead of collapsed sections.\r\n\r\nSwagger annotation changes apply to the following modules:\r\n\r\n- c2-protocol-api\r\n- c2-protocol-component-api\r\n- minifi-c2-service\r\n- nifi-api\r\n- nifi-client-dto\r\n- nifi-extension-manifest-model\r\n- nifi-registry-revision-entity-model\r\n- nifi-registry-data-model\r\n- nifi-registry-web-api\r\n- nifi-web-api\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

SNAPSHOT versions of Apache Ratis. The integration tests were excluded from regular workflow execution due to instability, so changes include removing the classes from the list.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following
