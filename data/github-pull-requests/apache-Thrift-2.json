To keep testing with \"net8 / C#12\" a 2nd project `Thrift.PublicInterfaces.Compile-C#12.Tests` is added, which keeps using the \"net8\" option.\r\nThe Thrift-files are shared between both projects, to reduce amount of duplicated code.\r\n\r\n--- \r\nAlternative ways I tried/had in mind:\r\n* generating code for all language-levels inside one project (generate to different folders inside the project): will not work, as it causes double definitions of generated symbols\r\n* having the test-job changing the code to run for all language-levels: feels ugly and hard to follow.

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nsee reason in https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2961\r\n\r\n> starting from python 3.10, this is a deprecated alias to TimeoutError: https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/socket.html#socket.timeout\r\n> while TimeoutError also exists in 3.8 (the earliest version of python still supported): https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/exceptions.html#TimeoutError\r\n> so I wonder if we should be more future proof and handle both socket.timeout and TimeoutError here, and then we can drop socket.timeout when 3.10 becomes the earliest version of python supported.\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [ ] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [ ] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

On 30s cpu profiles, although mallocgc reduced from 27.13s to 26.30s, the byte pool itself costed 11.9s. Looking at writeByte and readByte, writeByte increased from 3.69s to 5.89s, and readByte increased from 11.36s to 16.09s.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nThe thrift server is getting killed when using security port scan tools in the hosts running the thrift server. These tools try to connect to the open ports by sending requests to the ports, and the error can happen when accept syscall call, waiting for an incoming connection, or receiving a connection that terminates before the accept process completes, hence killing the thrift server. This can cause potential DoS (Denial of service) attacks on the applications running the thrift server, causing them to become unresponsive. Sometimes, even just running the netcat (nc -zvvvw2 <hostname> <thrift server port>) on the port remote can kill the entire thrift server, making it unresponsive.

the endpoint specifics for a Thrift API today is a purely textual exercise, which leaves the client end with the task to set up and stack together a proper protocol/transport stack. That sometimes even leads to headaches, e.g. if the server requires e.g. framed protocol which might not be obvious. The use of a generally accepted, machine-readable and extensible Thrift URI format to describe client bindings could streamline that process.\r\n\r\nDetails see

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n[THRIFT-5773: UUID wrapper for C++](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5773)\r\n\r\n  Adds a strong UUID wrapper for C++.\r\nThe use of a `std::string` can be misleading and since C++ is a strong typed language, this makes the most sense. \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [ ] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nWhen generating the JS Thrift clients, it hard-codes `this.output` in a few places; however, if `gen_node_` is true, our variable should be `output` instead. We set a variable, `outputVar`, up on line 1968/1970 of the file, but don't use it everywhere. In NodeJS environment, this can lead to the wrong flush being called, which can lead to issues; for example, with the header transport protocol, the headers can either go missing or be sent incorrectly.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\nI believe this is a trivial change not requiring a ticket.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] ~If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?~\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] ~If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.~\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  The code in `ParseQuotedStringBody()` was recursing in our application every time there was an escaped quote in strings  and generated a new string buffer for every recursive call. This was a real issue for escaped JSON in our application in particular.\r\n\r\nSo this pull requests moves that logic into a loop, and uses a string builder to avoid re-allocating buffers for every iteration.\r\n\r\nWe observed an ~40x decrease in p99 latency from 2 seconds -> 50 milliseconds on our servers when implementing this change. So it is a substantial performance improvement for this particular use case.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

libraries want to bypass the TServer class and handle the full service startup manually. For example when building a service that hosts multiple thrift services where the IFace type is unknown when handling a request.\r\n\r\nFor example when you host multiple services on top of netty and through an HTTP path you want to route to the correct thrift service. In this situation you treat can treat an IFace as an Object and use the `getProcessMapView()` method to parse a byte array into a thrift message and pass let the `AsyncProcessFunction` handle the invocation.\r\n\r\nTo return a correct thrift response it's necessary to write the `{service_name}_result` that contains the response args. While it is possible to get an incoming args object from the (Async)ProcessFunction its unfortunately not possible to get a result object without using reflection.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the (Async)ProcessFunction by adding a `getEmptyResultInstance` method that returns a new generic `A` (answer) that matches the `{service_name}_result` object.\r\n\r\nThis allows thrift users to write the following processing code:\r\n```java\r\n<I> void handleRequest(\r\n        TProtocol in,\r\n        TProtocol out,\r\n        TBaseAsyncProcessor<I> processor,\r\n        I asyncIface\r\n) throws TException {\r\n    final Map<String, AsyncProcessFunction<Object, TBase<?, ?>, TBase<?, ?>, TBase<?, ?>>> processMap = (Map) processor.getProcessMapView();\r\n    final var msg = in.readMessageBegin();\r\n    final var fn = processMap.get(msg.name);\r\n\r\n    final var args = fn.getEmptyArgsInstance();\r\n    args.read(in);\r\n    in.readMessageEnd();\r\n\r\n    if (fn.isOneway()) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn.start(asyncIface, args, new AsyncMethodCallback<>() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onComplete(TBase<?, ?> o) {\r\n            try {\r\n                out.writeMessageBegin(new TMessage(fn.getMethodName(), TMessageType.REPLY, msg.getSeqid()));\r\n                final var response_result = fn.getEmptyResultInstance();\r\n                final var success_field = response_result.fieldForId(SUCCESS_ID);\r\n                ((TBase) response_result).setFieldValue(success_field, o);\r\n                response_result.write(out);\r\n                out.writeMessageEnd();\r\n                out.getTransport().flush();\r\n            } catch (TException e) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onError(Exception e) {\r\n            try {\r\n                out.writeMessageBegin(new TMessage(fn.getMethodName(), TMessageType.EXCEPTION, msg.getSeqid()));\r\n                ((TApplicationException) e).write(out);\r\n                out.writeMessageEnd();\r\n                out.getTransport().flush();\r\n            } catch (TException ex) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(ex);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe above example code doesn't need any reference to the original types and can dynamically create the correct objects to return a correct response.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think.","created_at":"2024-02-26T11:10:32Z","updated_at":"2024-03-15T20:37:59Z","closed_at":"2024-03-05T23:53:58Z","merged_at":"2024-03-05T23:53:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"b6cf04941f29ecb4c44ab10ba1c4df3e8bccbaec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4288404393,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAS9U87_m9up","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/labels/java","name":"java","color":"ffa221","default":false,"description":"Pull

PR submits fixes to the focal and jammy docker images.\r\n\r\n* Bionic support was dropped becaused dotnet 8 no longer supports bionic (Ubuntu 18.04). Moved to `old/` like other unmaintained images.\r\n* Focal/Jammy used the wrong apt location for dotnet, endpoint was 18.04 instead of 20.04/22.04\r\n* Jammy cannot build Erlang OPT 23 since it depends on OpenSSL 1.1 which was dropped in favor of 3.0. Using Erlang OPT 25 fixes the problem since it depends on OpenSSL 3.0\r\n* Jammy was installing JDK 11 but lib/java requires Java 17\r\n\r\nAll containers used the `root` used to volume map the local files into the running container. This creates a hard to maintain working directory on Linux and MacOS since files form the local user and root user are mixed.\r\nTo solve this the new docker files can be build using the UID and GID of the host so the files dont mix. The script uses UID and GID 1000 since these are the default ids for most Linux distros.\r\n\r\nChange the travis yml to build with 20.04 instead of 18.04. Removed all traces of 18.04 but it cant be tested locally.\r\n\r\nUpdated the README to reflect the new `build/docker/` directory.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you prefer to remove the `old/` directory completely instead of moving `bionic` into it.","created_at":"2024-02-25T11:25:35Z","updated_at":"2024-07-27T10:02:06Z","closed_at":"2024-04-02T12:09:28Z","merged_at":"2024-04-02T12:09:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"63f04583e389e7afee330f0341e045a73cdb1979","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6075782384,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAS9U88AAAABaiUU8A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/labels/build%20and%20general%20CI","name":"build

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nAdd type hinting (with native enums (IntEnum)) for python generated code\r\n\r\n  1. Squashed and rebased changes from [stale PR](https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/2523)\r\n  2. Removed the controversial runtime type check as it goes beyond strictly annotations\r\n  3. Added type_hints as a default option to `RunClientServer.py` and `generate.cmake`. \r\n  4. Enabled testing against thrift test suite\r\n  5. Made enum regeneration explicitly required instead of implied when this flag is provided\r\n  6. Added python tests to verify basic annotations are getting added\r\n  7. Generate a thrift_spec attribute variable declaration for all generated thrift structures and optionally type hint it if type_hints are enabled\r\nNote: Appveyor x86 / Python 3.5 build is failing since this PR generates variable type hints (`x: int = 1`), which are only[ python 3.6 and up](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/). Do we have any patterns established for skipping tests based on platform/python version? \r\n  \r\nExample difference in generated code after running `thrift --gen py:type_hints` against:\r\n```\r\nstruct OneOfEachZZ {\r\n  1: required bool im_true,\r\n  2: bool im_false,\r\n  3: byte a_bite,\r\n  4: i16 integer16,\r\n  5: i32 integer32,\r\n  6: i64 integer64,\r\n  7: double double_precision,\r\n  8: string some_characters,\r\n  9: string zomg_unicode,\r\n  10: optional bool what_who\r\n}\r\n\r\nservice UnderscoreSrv {\r\n  i64 some_rpc_call(1: string message, 2: OneOfEachZZ sample_struct)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<details><summary>ttypes.py</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@37314fef4537:/thrift/src/test# diff gen-py/FullCamelTest/ttypes.py gen-py-old/FullCamelTest/ttypes.py \r\n6c6\r\n< #  options string: py\r\n---\r\n> #  options string: py:type_hints\r\n8a9,10\r\n> from __future__ import annotations\r\n> import typing\r\n12a15\r\n> from enum import IntEnum\r\n37,47c40,50\r\n<     def __init__(self, im_true = None, im_false = None, a_bite = None, integer16 = None, integer32 = None, integer64 = None, double_precision = None, some_characters = None, zomg_unicode = None, what_who = None,):\r\n<         self.im_true = im_true\r\n<         self.im_false = im_false\r\n<         self.a_bite = a_bite\r\n<         self.integer16 = integer16\r\n<         self.integer32 = integer32\r\n<         self.integer64 = integer64\r\n<         self.double_precision = double_precision\r\n<         self.some_characters = some_characters\r\n<         self.zomg_unicode = zomg_unicode\r\n<         self.what_who = what_who\r\n---\r\n>     def __init__(self, im_true: bool = None, im_false: typing.Optional[bool] = None, a_bite: typing.Optional[int] = None, integer16: typing.Optional[int] = None, integer32: typing.Optional[int] = None, integer64: typing.Optional[int] = None, double_precision: typing.Optional[float] = None, some_characters: typing.Optional[str] = None, zomg_unicode: typing.Optional[str] = None, what_who: typing.Optional[bool] = None,):\r\n>         self.im_true: bool = im_true\r\n>         self.im_false: typing.Optional[bool] = im_false\r\n>         self.a_bite: typing.Optional[int] = a_bite\r\n>         self.integer16: typing.Optional[int] = integer16\r\n>         self.integer32: typing.Optional[int] = integer32\r\n>         self.integer64: typing.Optional[int] = integer64\r\n>         self.double_precision: typing.Optional[float] = double_precision\r\n>         self.some_characters: typing.Optional[str] = some_characters\r\n>         self.zomg_unicode: typing.Optional[str] = zomg_unicode\r\n>         self.what_who: typing.Optional[bool] = what_who\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n<details><summary>UnderscoreSrv.py</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@37314fef4537:/thrift/src/test# diff gen-py/FullCamelTest/UnderscoreSrv.py gen-py-old/FullCamelTest/UnderscoreSrv.py \r\n6c6\r\n< #  options string: py\r\n---\r\n> #  options string: py:type_hints\r\n8a9,10\r\n> from __future__ import annotations\r\n> import typing\r\n12a15\r\n> from enum import IntEnum\r\n23c26\r\n<     def some_rpc_call(self, message, sample_struct):\r\n---\r\n>     def some_rpc_call(self, message: str, sample_struct: OneOfEachZZ) -> int:\r\n40c43\r\n<     def some_rpc_call(self, message, sample_struct):\r\n---\r\n>     def some_rpc_call(self, message: str, sample_struct: OneOfEachZZ) -> int:\r\n50c53\r\n<     def send_some_rpc_call(self, message, sample_struct):\r\n---\r\n>     def send_some_rpc_call(self, message: str, sample_struct: OneOfEachZZ):\r\n59c62\r\n<     def recv_some_rpc_call(self):\r\n---\r\n>     def recv_some_rpc_call(self) -> int:\r\n137,139c140,142\r\n<     def __init__(self, message = None, sample_struct = None,):\r\n<         self.message = message\r\n<         self.sample_struct = sample_struct\r\n---\r\n>     def __init__(self, message: typing.Optional[str] = None, sample_struct: typing.Optional[OneOfEachZZ] = None,):\r\n>         self.message: typing.Optional[str] = message\r\n>         self.sample_struct: typing.Optional[OneOfEachZZ] = sample_struct\r\n212,213c215,216\r\n<     def __init__(self, success = None,):\r\n<         self.success = success\r\n---\r\n>     def __init__(self, success: typing.Optional[int] = None,):\r\n>         self.success: typing.Optional[int] = success\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n\r\nUnrelated to these changes, I noticed that even if a field is marked as required, `declare_argument` generates a default value in the function arguments of None. \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\nOpen questions: Since the original PR opened, \r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nThe generated typescript client includes type definitions like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n    addProfile(profile: types_ttypes.Profile): Promise<types_ttypes.Profile>;\r\n\r\n    addProfile(profile: types_ttypes.Profile, callback?: (error: void, response: types_ttypes.Profile)=>void): void;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is ambigous as the second definition overrides the first one since callback is optional. And is in fact not how the client works.\r\n\r\nThe correct types should be:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n    addProfile(profile: types_ttypes.Profile): Promise<types_ttypes.Profile>;\r\n\r\n    addProfile(profile: types_ttypes.Profile, callback: (error: void, response: types_ttypes.Profile)=>void): void;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to run this nasty sed, so it would be nice to get this fix in. 😄 \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfind \"$out_dir\" -name '*.d.ts' -type f -exec sed -i '' -e '/.*callback\\?:.*/d' {} \\;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my understanding, this should always be the case, as the older synchronous+callback API would be:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n    addProfile(profile: types_ttypes.Profile): types_ttypes.Profile;\r\n\r\n    addProfile(profile: types_ttypes.Profile, callback: (error: void, response: types_ttypes.Profile)=>void): void;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I don't really see a scenario where the callback would be optional without also changing the return type.\r\n\r\nRegarding this being a breaking change, as long as a function signature with an optional callback and one without a callback are available, only the callback style function signature will be valid. So I don't think this is a breaking change.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nPHP 8.1 has deprecated passing null values to non-nullable internal function parameters:\r\nhttps://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_null_to_scalar_internal_arg\r\n\r\nThis can lead to deprecation warnings and potential errors in future versions.\r\n\r\nExample of a deprecation warning:\r\n`PHP Deprecated: strlen(): Passing null to parameter #1 ($string) of type string is deprecated in Thrift/StringFunc/Core.php on line 38`\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR will not affect previous versions of PHP, meaning these changes are backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build

([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build
