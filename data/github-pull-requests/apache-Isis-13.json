[29-Apr-2023]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Jsoup.connect(url), natively support URLs with Unicode characters in the path or query string,\nwithout having to be escaped by the caller.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1914\">jhy/jsoup#1914</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: Calling Node.remove() on a node with no parent is now a no-op, vs a validation error.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1898\">jhy/jsoup#1898</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: aligned the HTML Tree Builder processing steps for AfterBody and AfterAfterBody to the updated WHATWG\nstandard, to not pop the stack to close <!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted --> elements. This prevents an errant <!-- raw HTML omitted --> closing preceding\nstructure.

[29-Apr-2023]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Jsoup.connect(url), natively support URLs with Unicode characters in the path or query string,\nwithout having to be escaped by the caller.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1914\">jhy/jsoup#1914</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: Calling Node.remove() on a node with no parent is now a no-op, vs a validation error.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1898\">jhy/jsoup#1898</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: aligned the HTML Tree Builder processing steps for AfterBody and AfterAfterBody to the updated WHATWG\nstandard, to not pop the stack to close <!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted --> elements. This prevents an errant <!-- raw HTML omitted --> closing preceding\nstructure.
