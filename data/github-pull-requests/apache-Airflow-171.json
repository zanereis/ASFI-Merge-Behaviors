This means the class would carry some dead weight, but that's a practical tradeoff since validating whether a field is needed is too difficult to automate without intimacy to the code base.\r\n\r\nA new function refresh_from_instance() is added to TaskInstance, which is used for both \"defreeze\" a SimpleTaskInstance back into a TI, and loading a TI from the database via refresh_from_db(). Since refresh_from_db() is very heavily used and any errors are caught quickly by various tests, it is very difficult to miss a field in that function, thus indirectly guaranteeing both the SimpleTaskInstance does not miss a\r\nnew field added to TaskInstance, and the defreezing process does not miss setting a field on SimpleTaskInstance back to the TI.\r\n\r\nClose

have been some changes to the filename conventions over time  and the release check script was not updated to reflect this.  This PR fixes the script and tries to simplify it a little bit.  In particular, the regex approach used previously was broken by the removal of the `-bin` identifier.  It is easy enough to simply compute all the expected files exactly and look for them, so that is what we do here\r\n\r\n**Note on how you can verify that this works**\r\n\r\nYou can verify this works on releases we've already released with these commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython check_files.py -v 1.4.0 -t upgrade_check -p ../../airflow-release/airflow\r\npython check_files.py -v 2.1.1 -t providers -p ../../airflow-release/airflow\r\npython check_files.py -v 2.2.0 -t airflow -p ../../airflow-release/airflow\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor providers you need to put something in packages.txt e.g. I tested `apache-airflow-providers-airbyte` version 2.1.1.\r\n\r\nAssumes you cloned like so: `svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow`\r\n\r\nAnd also works with RCs (which was another issue I think):\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir ~/code/airflow-rc\r\ncd ~/code/airflow-rc\r\nsvn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run:\r\n```\r\npython check_files.py -v 2.2.1rc2 -t airflow -p ../../airflow-rc/airflow\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note on tests**\r\n\r\nI included a simple test, since it was helpful as part of development anyway.  Not sure this needs to be part of the normal airflow test suite so I just left it inline.","created_at":"2021-10-27T02:15:32Z","updated_at":"2022-01-22T16:58:45Z","closed_at":"2021-10-27T18:05:48Z","merged_at":"2021-10-27T18:05:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"b49b81ac8466922cb704f989910e1811b7cb4fa9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

is an ongoing effort to enhance example DAGs by setting static values for `start_date` (already complete for core example DAGs), cleaning up and/or implementing useful `default_args`, and removing/limiting the use of redundant, default connection ID values.\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly addresses these 3 cleanup areas in example DAGs in the Amazon provider.  There are other small docs-related updates, enhancing an example DAG to take advantage of `XComArgs` via the `.output` operator property, and removal of `get_current_context` use in preference for direct `task_instance` access.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

that the future direction of package installation for Python\r\nis to always use virtualenvs to install dependencies. There was a\r\nheated discussion about it in the issue here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10556\r\n\r\nand general consensus is that virtualenv building should also be\r\nused in Docker images as it can help to avoid multiple\r\nproblems related to interference between distro-managed and\r\nPIP-managed files.\r\n\r\nThis change implements it - both PROD and CI images are converted\r\nto use virtualenv for installation and instead of copying\r\nthe `.local` directory between image segments they do the same\r\nwith newly created `/.venv` virtual environment. All dependencies\r\nand shared libraries are installed there are and shared between\r\nall users using the images.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

this recent change: [18902](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/18902), docker version parsing no longer works in all cases:\r\n```\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ ./breeze \r\n/home/onikolas/code/airflow/scripts/ci/libraries/_initialization.sh: line 932: printf: 190313ce: invalid number\r\n```\r\nThis is specifically due to the whitespace being removed from this line:\r\n```\r\n-  printf \"%04d%04d%04d%.0s\" ${1//[.-]/ }\r\n+  printf \"%03d%03d%03d%.0s\" ${1//[.-]/}\r\n```\r\n`printf` is expecting at least 3 `%d` arguments which it parses as integers to 3 decimal places. But the missing whitespace in the bash expansion causes the version to not be split into multiple inputs into `printf` as expected, but rather one string:\r\n\r\n**With** whitespace in expansion:\r\n```\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ docker_version=\"19.03.13\"\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ echo ${docker_version//[.-]/ }\r\n19 03 13\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ printf \"%03d%03d%03d%.0s\" ${docker_version//[.-]/ }\r\n019003013\r\n```\r\n**Without** whitespace in expansion:\r\n```\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ docker_version=\"19.03.13\"\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ echo ${docker_version//[.-]/}\r\n190313\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ printf \"%03d%03d%03d%.0s\" ${docker_version_2//[.-]/}\r\n190313000000\r\n```\r\nAs you can see in the latter case the entire version is used as the first argument to `printf` and then `printf` defaults the second and third `%d` with zeros since input is not provided, which is why 6 trailing zeros are seen in the output.\r\nThis defaulting allowed the code to pass undetected when it was tested originally, since the `<=` version comparison still passes with this input. It is not until a community edition docker version is used which includes '-ce' in the version that this breaks:\r\ndocker community edition version output:\r\n```\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ docker --version\r\nDocker version 19.03.13-ce, build 4484c46\r\n```\r\nWhen run through the breeze version extraction logic yields:\r\n```\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ docker_version=$(docker version --format '{{.Client.Version}}' | sed 's/\\+.*$//' || true)\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ echo $docker_version\r\n19.03.13-ce\r\n```\r\nWhen this input is run through the `printf` logic, **with** whitespace, you can see the input version is properly split into separate inputs for `printf`, which uses the first three arguments and the last argument (the `ce` portion) is unused. Yielding a useable version:\r\n```\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ echo ${docker_version//[.-]/ }\r\n19 03 13 ce\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ printf \"%03d%03d%03d%.0s\" ${docker_version//[.-]/ }\r\n019003013\r\n```\r\nHowever when the version of the code **without** the whitespace, `printf` is given one large input which it uses as the first arg. Which includes `ce` which is not parseable as a number. Which yields the original error message:\r\n```\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ echo ${docker_version//[.-]/}\r\n190313ce\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ printf \"%03d%03d%03d%.0s\" ${docker_version_2//[.-]/}\r\n190313000000\r\n[onikolas@dev-dsk-onikolas airflow]$ printf \"%03d%03d%03d%.0s\" ${docker_version//[.-]/}\r\n-logbash: printf: 190313ce: invalid number\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change re-adds the whitespace to the expansion which correctly handles both usecases.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

[this Slack thread](https://apache-airflow.slack.com/archives/CQ9QHSFQX/p1634668910074400), a user was attempting to setup a virtual env to do some testing of code changes. The user reported:\r\n\r\n>  I got the breeze initialize-local-virtualenv command to complete successfully but I still am missing packages in my venv.\r\n\r\nThis is because it is not possible to specify to breeze which extras you'd like to install in the venv (this user needed azure). To get specific extras, users have to fall back to manually run commands from our docs which can be error prone.\r\n\r\nThis change allows users to export the extras they'd like breeze to install for them.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nManually tested both the default case (no user export, use `devel`) and overridden case (user exports `VIRTUALENV_EXTRAS`), both cases functioned correctly and installed the expected extras.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

2.2 - the same issue occurs.\r\n\r\n**SAMPLE DAG**\r\nWe are using `KubernetesExecutor`, DAGs with `KubernetesPodOperator`, and `run_as_user` setting.\r\nTo reproduce the bug, we've created a sample dag:\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\n\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\nfrom airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators import kubernetes_pod\r\nfrom airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator\r\nfrom kubernetes.client import models as k8s\r\n\r\nYESTERDAY = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)\r\n\r\ndefault_args = {\r\n

 'in_cluster': True,\r\n  'startup_timeout_seconds': 300,\r\n  'hostnetwork': True,\r\n  'run_as_user': \"airflow\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n        dag_id='chart_test_dag',\r\n

DummyOperator(task_id=\"start\", dag=dag)\r\n\r\n    pro = kubernetes_pod.KubernetesPodOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"pro\",\r\n        dag=dag,\r\n        name=\"pro\",\r\n        cmds=[\"bash\",

constraints file that was used in the example code snippets is a constraints file for released versions (e.g.: airflow/constraints-main/constraints-3.6.txt). Which was leading to long dependency resolution times as well as dependency version conflicts when using the latest source from main. The correct constraints to use in this case is for example: airflow/constraints-main/constraints-source-providers-3.6.txt (docs explaining the differences for each type of constraints file can be [found here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pinned-constraint-files)).\r\n\r\nNote that constraints-source-providers is what is used by breeze if you use it to setup your local virtual env (as [seen here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/e6fcf7776a298cff741d8a55f0990ea796fd0540/breeze#L262)).

users wishing to trigger Amazon Redshift queries today have to use a Postgres connection.  While effective, this has the limitation that the Redshift cluster must expose a Postgres endpoint that is accessible to the Airflow environment.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, the AWS Boto3 library exposes a client called [redshift-data](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/redshift-data.html) that allows users to query and retrieve data via the AWS API and avoid the necessity of a Postgres connection.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a RedshiftDataHook to the existing Redshift provider, along with tests and an example, which wraps the \"redshift-data\" Boto3 client and allows users to run Redshift queries without a Postgres connection.\r\n\r\nIn the future, this capability could be added to any existing Redshift transfer operator, with an option to auto-detect whether to use Postgres or Boto3 based upon the connection type.","created_at":"2021-10-21T16:42:39Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T18:44:44Z","closed_at":"2022-03-02T20:18:34Z","merged_at":"2022-03-02T20:18:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"af79df69b2fe4d71fa244087d5cfd031d809bc7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

Please pay particular attention to the regexes that I tweaked.\r\n\r\nI may have been a little overzealous with my changes, namely:\r\n* It seems like sometimes explicit string concatenation was done to differentiate a line from its surroundings. I'm not sure if we want to keep things that way, or force everything to use implicit concatenation.\r\n* I also reformatted some of the SQL statements to (IMO) make them a bit more readable.\r\n\r\nI also updated the tabulate dependency from 0.8.7 to 0.8.8 to fix an issue when attempting to run unit tests under Python 3.10. Those tests still fail for other reasons but this is one less speed bump when we add that, however, I'm not sure if including that change is appropriate in this

#19059.\r\n\r\nVersion parsing capabilities when building provider packages is now provided by `packaging.version.Version` instead. Non-Python software version parsing (sqlite) is re-implemented with regex.\r\n\r\nUsages of `strtobool` are replaced by the `to_boolean` utility function in the `airflow.utils.strings` module. This function is a bit more permissive than `strtobool`, but should be good enough for how Airflow uses it for. This function is available since 2.0 and should be safe for usages in provider packages as well.\r\n\r\nThe `copy_file` usage is replaced by `shutils.copy2()`, which is good enough for Airflow's needs.\r\n\r\nThe distutils reference in setup.py is kept since the file is only used at build-time against setuptools, which patches the distutils import with a vendored copy and is not deprecated.\r\n\r\nSee also *Migration Advice* in [PEP
