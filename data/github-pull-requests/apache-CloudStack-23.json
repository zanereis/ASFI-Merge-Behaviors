Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMWare (version 6.5), when trying to detach a volume, vCenter detaches it successfully; however, ACS throws an exception. It already was reported in VMWare and ACS' communities, but it hasn't been fixed yet. For more information about this error, please check this links ([1], [2], [3]).\r\n\r\nTo know why ACS tries to check folder content, please check these links ([4], [5]). This error apparently only occurs with datastores that use the NFS protocol and  n specific versions of VMWare. Users using VMFS or VMWare versions greater than 6.7 have not reported this error. If the operation performed is a volume detach, it was successful. If you want to know why this error occurs in VMWare, please contact VMWare's technical support.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I created a new VM with two disks;\r\n2. I tried to detach the datadisk;\r\n3. Before, an exception was thrown, and, in the ACS database, the VM was still with two disks, however, in vCenter the volume was already detached;\r\n5. Now,  detach volume process finish with success.\r\n\r\n----\r\n- [1] https://communities.vmware.com/t5/VMware-vSphere-Discussions/VCSA-6-7-Datastore-browser-empty-error-500/td-p/2300628\r\n- [2]

Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMWare hypervisor with Veeam integration enabled, restoring a VM from a backup removes the VM NICs. This happens because the NicVO object does not override the `equals` and `hashCode` methods; thereforen, when ACS tries to sync the NICs of the restored VM with the NICs saved in the database, the comparison always returns `false`, and ACS removes the VM NIC.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt's tested in a local lab:\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to standardize and fix grammatical errors in the `locales/en.json` file to enhance the user experience. The following conventions were used:\r\nDescriptions and tooltips end with `.`;\r\nEllipses use 3 dots;\r\nCapitalization was standardized to start a phrase with a capitalized word and all the following words to be lowercase, unless when dealing with nouns.\r\n\r\nFinally, a label was renamed to be more aligned with it's meaning.\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X]

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve the error message while trying to update the storage tags of a Disk Offering when none of the Primary Storages have that set of storage tags. The current behavior only showed the ID of the Disk Offering and Storage Pools. This PR improves the error message to display the UUID of these components, as well as their names and the volumes using that Disk Offering. Furthermore, it was added unit tests for the modified method `updateOfferingTagsIfIsNotNull`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/165189983-2df6e29c-c551-41b5-8ff8-9b3f648c18f2.png)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab trying to update the storage tags of a disk offering, when none of the primary storages had that set of storage tags.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #6263.\r\nThe issue is that an Exception is thrown when scaling a customized offering, changing the CPU/Memory but keeping the same disk offering.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a fix for this issue by skipping the volume \"upgrade\" process in such situations, avoiding any operations and also the thrown exception.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the disk offering is the same, there is no need to run all actions of the respective method.\r\nThe skipped actions are, in summary:\r\n1. run DB updates matching the \"new offering\";\r\n2. publish EVENT_VOLUME_RESIZE;\r\n3. if volume migration is required (and allowed), find a suitable pool to migrate volume in case the current pool does not match the new offering needs;\r\n4. return a \"Volume\" object containing all the changes.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case

changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n- Scale (via UI or API) a VM with the custom offering, keeping the same offering but updating the Memory and/or CPU.\r\n- After skipping the validation, all worked out fine.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix various inconsistencies in the front and back-end concerning the VM statistics. I mainly enhanced the descriptions, adding explanations and/or context, but also corrected some errors in the units of measurements (there were cases of metrics being represented in bytes when the correct one should be KiB, for example).\r\nAlso, many inconsistencies were tested and found in the way stats were being collected for the KVM hypervisor. Namely, when generating the `VmMetricsResponse`, the network usage was being overwritten with the disk usage, so neither disk nor network usage was correct. Another issue was that memory usage wasn't being properly collected.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab, by creating VMs and comparing their internal stats with the ones gathered by CloudStack.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-11T18:46:19Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T11:52:57Z","closed_at":"2022-04-22T11:52:57Z","merged_at":"2022-04-22T11:52:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4e95e310587b084770b6778836c196d01fbeac5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584072971,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzI5NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:kvm","name":"component:kvm","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21/labels","id":6943953,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjk0Mzk1Mw==","number":21,"title":"4.17.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":383,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-14T02:05:05Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/6245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/bb64fd3405d7747b81ac6a5a216957a40be7167f","head":{"label":"scclouds:fix-vm-stats-inconsistencies","ref":"fix-vm-stats-inconsistencies","sha":"bb64fd3405d7747b81ac6a5a216957a40be7167f","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization",

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to correct the `migrateVolume` API permissions for the default users role. While the ACS UI currently only allows users with the `roleType` admin to perform volume migration, all default non-read-only roles have permission to use the `migrateVolume` API. However, this permission does not make sense for a common user, not even via API; to properly use `migrateVolume` it`s necessary to have knowledge about the cloud structure. Therefore, a common user should not be allowed by default to this API method.\r\n\r\nWe are not saying that somebody cannot create a custom role allowing such a process; however, we should not provide such a scenario by default, as it might lead to some unexpected behaviors and/or misuses of the cloud environment.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would

Description\r\n\r\nIt was already possible via API to attach and detach ROOT disks as well as DATADISKs. However, it was only possible to call these methods on DATADISKs through the UI. This PR implements this functionality on the ROOT disks via UI as well with the use of the `deviceid` parameter. Moreover, the API description for `attachVolume` was improved for a better understanding.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/161584396-853ccb0f-52ad-4c74-a23e-f7d20c90cf20.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested on a local lab with the following scenarios:\r\n\r\nVM1 with ROOT disk and DATA disk:\r\n- Attach DATADISK with deviceid = 0 gives error, as expected.\r\n- Attach DATADISK with deviceid = 1 gives error, as expected.\r\n- Attach DATADISK with deviceid = 2 with success, as expected.\r\n\r\nVM2 without ROOT disk:\r\n- Attach DATADISK with deviceid = 0. The DATADISK was recognized as ROOT disk, as expected.\r\n- Attach DATADISK with deviceid = 5 with success, as

Description\r\n\r\nHello dev team. I am a Japanese user. I would like to update the Japanese translation. I have one question to ask. The translated text in the json file is a Unicode string. Is it okay to decode this into a Japanese string? That makes translation conversion easier. I'm sorry I couldn't find a channel to discuss and asked a question on PR.\r\nThis is still WIP, so I'm using Draft PR.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR does two things:\r\n\r\n1. In a recent commit the way host CPU speed is detected was changed to use `lscpu`. This is a great enhancement, but it changed the detected speed from being the host's max turbo frequency to being the base clock. I agree this is the ideal speed to use since the max turbo frequency usually is not achieved by all cores at once. To ensure the fallback of using `cpufreq` files matches this behavior, we change the fallback to look at the `base_frequency` file rather than `cpuinfo_max_freq`.\r\n\r\n2. Introduce agent.properties setting `host.cpu.manual.speed.mhz` to allow the admin to set the frequency in case all else fails.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature
