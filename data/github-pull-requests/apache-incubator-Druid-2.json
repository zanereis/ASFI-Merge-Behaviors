is the 2nd PR as the follow-up of the PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17548. It migrates the remaining 6 sets of SQL tests to quidem.  These 6 sets cover aggregation, array, json, mv, reduction, and other scalar functions.\r\n\r\nThese tests use the existing kttm dataset.  They aim to exercise SQL queries in a more comprehensive way:\r\n\r\n**Aggregation functions:**\r\n- Each aggregation function is exercised in 1 query shape: \r\ngroup by query\r\n- Each query covers all operators in the predicates of the `having` clause. \r\n- All queries are designed to return 7 rows.\r\n\r\n**Scalar functions:**\r\n- Each scalar function is exercised in 3 different query shapes: \r\nsimple query\r\nsubquery\r\ngroup by query\r\n- Each query covers all operators in the predicates of the `where` clause. \r\n- All queries are select count(*) queries.  They are designed to all return the same result for easy maintenance and debugging.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

new metric `ingest/processed/bytes` has been introduced to track the total number of bytes processed during ingestion tasks, including native batch ingestion, streaming ingestion, and multi-stage query (MSQ) ingestion tasks. This metric helps provide a unified view of data processing across different ingestion pathways.\r\n\r\n#### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\nThis metric was added in three key ingestion task classes:\r\n\r\n- IndexTask: A sequential ingestion task. The processed bytes were retrieved from the RowIngestionMetersTotals object (buildSegmentsMeters) and emitted directly after segment publication.\r\n- ParallelIndexSupervisorTask: A task that supervises parallel ingestion. Processed bytes were aggregated from subtasks' ingestion metrics (RowIngestionMetersTotals).\r\n- SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner: A runner for ingestion tasks that consume data from seekable streams (e.g., Kafka). The processed bytes were calculated based on the size of the data buffers (e.g., ByteEntity buffers) being processed for each record. The metric was emitted for each processed record.\r\n- MsqContollerImpl: The ingest/processed/bytes metric is emitted by aggregating bytes processed across all stages and workers during MSQ task execution. This includes fetching counters from the CounterSnapshotsTree, summing up bytes from all input channels for each worker and stage using a stream-based aggregation logic and emitting the aggregated bytes as the ingest/processed/bytes metric for the entire MSQ task.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #17574.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Additionally, with the introduction of the jmod system, the job failed to find the correct JDK-included modules because the new classloader constructed for the job didn't reference the system classloader. Adding ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader() as the parent classloader fixes this.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\n`driud.expressions.useStrictBooleans` has been deprecated, this PR removes it effectively setting it to always be true. With this it means that Druid always handles boolean types as longs with 1 for true and 0 for false, and expression logical operations behave in sql compatible manner.\r\n\r\nRelated #17575\r\n\r\nI have not updated the docs yet because docs on this are intertwined with discussion about `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull` and `druid.generic.useThreeValueLogicForNativeFilters`, so I will address them all in one shot in a follow-up after everything is removed.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nSkipping writing the release note for just this PR, i think it makes sense to have a combined release note for when this, `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull`, and `druid.generic.useThreeValueLogicForNativeFilters` are all removed.","created_at":"2024-12-14T00:24:05Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T05:56:25Z","closed_at":"2024-12-18T02:49:16Z","merged_at":"2024-12-18T02:49:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"a44ab109d55ab52366386d99cd116db359ebdd43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in [this review comment](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17566#discussion_r1884089006), since we aren't supporting Java 8 anymore, we can switch to diamond operators wherever possible without specifying explicit type arguments.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```java\r\n// Example 1:\r\nprivate ArrayList<InputRow> longRows = new ArrayList<InputRow>();\r\n// The above can be replaced with the following:\r\nprivate ArrayList<InputRow> longRows = new ArrayList<>();\r\n\r\n// Example 2:\r\nnew TypeReference<List<DataSegmentChangeRequest>>()\r\n      {\r\n      };\r\n// The above can be replaced with the following:\r\nnew TypeReference<>() {};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR makes this change across the project.\r\n\r\nNote: This change was done with IntelliJ's project-wide inspection results for warnings like `Explicit type argument Integer, Iterator<Integer> can be replaced with <> `. With that, there were a few compilation issues, which were manually fixed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR adds the ability to attach restrictions (e.x. row filters) to a query, thus restrict row-level data access for given users. Note that this feature is not directly available, and requires additional work in `Authorizer`. \r\n\r\nThis PR has been tested in a local druid cluster with additional `Authorizer` changes.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nA query follows these steps: initialize -> authorize -> execute. In the authorize step, the permissions are checked for all the required resources in the query. Before this PR, the authorize step only returns allow or deny access on a table. Granting access to a table means a user can see all data in this table. After this PR, the authorize step can return allow access along with restrictions (i.e. a row filter that must be applied to the table ), which restrict users' data access at row level. For example, customers can only see rows relevant to their company.\r\n\r\nThe `authorizeAllResourceActions` now returns a `AuthorizationResult` instead of `Access`. The main difference between `AuthorizationResult` and `Access` is that the former contains a map of table with restriction (i.e. `Policy`)\r\n\r\nIn the authorize step of `QueryLifecycle`, it would add the `Policy` to tables in the datasource tree, transform `TableDataSource` to `RestrictedDataSource`. In the execute step, `Policy` is enforced through `RestrictedSegment` and `RestrictedCursorFactory`, the filter inside `Policy` would be attached to the `CursorHolder`. \r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n 1. <b>`Policy`</b> interface and subclasses. \r\n     * a `Policy` represents granular restrictions when reading tables.\r\n     * `NoRestrictionPolicy` should be used by druid-internal and superuser.\r\n     * `RowFilterPolicy` is a basic row filter restriction.\r\n 2. `Access`. Added `Optional<Policy> policy` field, which represents a restrictions returned from `authorizer`. Also updated constructor.\r\n<br></br> \r\n 3. <b>`AuthorizationResult`</b>. The class should be used for all the authorization calls, while the `Access` class is still used in `Authorizer` interface. It has an static variable `ALLOW_NO_RESTRICTION`, which should be used for all internal calls. The class contains:\r\n    * permission, an enum defines the permission check result.\r\n    * failure message if authorization deny access. This is null when auth is allowed, and is the error message of the first resource action authorization failure (there might be more failures, but we don't try further)\r\n    * a map of table name with optional policy. \r\n 4. `AuthorizationUtils`. It now consolidates all restrictions for authorizing resource actions into a restrictions map, which is included in `AuthorizationResult`. Also updated javadoc for all public methods.\r\n <br></br>\r\n5. <b>`RestrictedDataSource`</b>, which wraps a `TableDataSource` with a `Policy`.\r\n6. <b> `RestrictedSegment`</b>, which represents a segment with a policy. \r\n7. <b> `BypassRestrictedSegment`</b>, a backdoor to retrieve the wrapped segment and policy from `RestrictedSegment`.\r\n8. <b> `RestrictedCursorFactory`</b>, enforces the policy on `Cursor`. \r\n<br></br>\r\n9. `DataSource` interface, added a sub type of `restrict`, added a default method `mapWithRestriction`. Also:\r\n    * `TableDataSource`, added the implementation of `mapWithRestriction`.\r\n    * `JoinDataSource` can accept `RestrictedDataSource` as left-hand side datasource.\r\n10. `QueryLifeCycle`, replace `baseQuery` with `baseQuery.withPolicyRestrictions` (except for `SegmentMetadataQuery`).\r\n <br></br>\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n * The restrictions don't apply to VIEWs.\r\n * `UnionDataSource` doesn't work with `RestrictedDataSource`, planning to fix that later.\r\n * The restrictions don't apply to `DartQueryMaker` and `MSQTaskQueryMaker`, for now they would throw an error if there's any policy restrictions.\r\n * In some places the access check might be overly-restrictive (e.x. cancel query).\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nchanges:\r\n* introduces FilteredInputBinding which adds better conditional expression processing support using a VectorMatch internally to selectively evaluate input vectors instead of precomputing all inputs, with nvl updated to take advantage of this\r\n* refactor some stuff to streamline expression vector processor implementation for simple functions like most math and logical operations with some new factory classes\r\n* update vector identifier expression processor to delegate evaluating results directly to the input binding selectors with ExprEvalBindingVector\r\n* add maxVectorSize() to ExprVectorProcessor to avoid having to pass max vector size around everywhere\r\n\r\nsome benchmarks with `nvl` before and after:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT NVL(string2, CONCAT(string1,

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

They aim to exercise SQL queries in a more comprehensive way:\r\n- Each scalar function is exercised in 3 different query shapes:\r\n  simple query\r\n  query with subquery\r\n  group-by query\r\n- Each query covers all operators in its predicates. \r\n- All queries are select count(*) queries.  The predicates are designed for all queries to return the same result for easy maintenance and debugging.\r\n\r\nThese are the initial sets of tests.  More tests will be added to cover the rest of the scalar and aggregation functions.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

possible for the stopAndCreateNewLeaderLatch to behave poorly for CuratorDruidLeaderSelector.notLeader if listener.stopBeingLeader() takes too long. From the comments in the code it seems like the intent of the code is to stop the overlord/coordinator that is going through the CuratorDruidLeaderSelector.notLeader process from regaining leadership, but the current order of the code is.\r\n\r\n1. listener.stopBeingLeader();\r\n2. close the old leader latch and create a new one (but don't start it)\r\n3. wait a period\r\n4. start the new leader latch\r\n\r\nBefore step 2, the overlord is able to be reassigned leadership in ZK (since its latch hasn't been closed yet). this can be a problem if listener.stopBeingLeader() takes too long (this can take a while on the overlord, specifically the process of shutting down the SupervisorManager (see: https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17535)), since the overlord can regain leadership as it is shutting down.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the order of the logic to prevent this issue.\r\n1. close the old leader latch and create a new one (but don't start it)\r\n2. listener.stopBeingLeader();\r\n3. wait a period\r\n4. start the new leader latch\r\n\r\nI have tested this in a test druid cluster by killing ZK leaders and observing faster recovery than without this change.\r\n### Description\r\n- Separate recreateLeaderLatch into stopAndCreateNewLeaderLatch/startLeaderLatch.\r\n- During a graceful leadership shutdown, call stopAndCreateNewLeaderLatch before notifying listeners to prevent the overlord/coordinator from being reassigned leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nImprove resilience of druid service leadership to zk outages\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `CuratorDruidLeaderSelector`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\n#17336 proposes adding a cache of segments on the leader Overlord to speed up segment allocation and other segment actions. But any caching mechanism can be efficient only if the leader Overlord is the source of truth and all segment updates happen through it.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to move the Coordinator APIs which update segments to the Overlord instead.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n#### Main classes to review\r\n- `DataSourcesResource`\r\n- `OverlordDataSourcesResources`\r\n- `OverlordClient` and `OverlordClientImpl`\r\n\r\n#### Summary of changes\r\n- Add `OverlordDataSourcesResource` with APIs to mark segments used/unused\r\n- Add corresponding methods to `OverlordClient`\r\n- Deprecate Coordinator APIs to update segments\r\n- Use `OverlordClient` in `DataSourcesResource` so that Coordinator APIs internally\r\ncall the corresponding Overlord APIs\r\n- If the API call fails, fall back to updating the metadata store directly\r\n- Audit these actions only on the Overlord\r\n\r\n#### Other minor changes\r\n- Do not perform null check on `OverlordClient` on the coordinator side `DataSourcesResource`.\r\n`OverlordClient` is always non-null in production.\r\n- Add new tests, fix existing ones\r\n- Complete the implementation of `TestSegmentsMetadataManager`\r\n\r\n### New Overlord APIs\r\n\r\n- Mark all segments of a datasource as unused:\r\n`POST /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}`\r\n- Mark all (non-overshadowed) segments of a datasource as used:\r\n`DELETE /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}`\r\n- Mark multiple segments as used\r\n`POST /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/markUsed`\r\n- Mark multiple (non-overshadowed) segments as unused\r\n`POST /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/markUnused`\r\n- Mark a single segment as used:\r\n`POST /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/segments/{segmentId}`\r\n- Mark a single segment as unused:\r\n`DELETE /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/segments/{segmentId}`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Sample response\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"numUpdatedSegments\": 3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Rolling upgrades\r\n\r\nDuring a rolling upgrade, if the leader Coordinator gets upgraded before the leader Overlord,\r\nit might try to call new Overlord APIs but that would throw a 404 NOT FOUND error.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the Coordinator falls back to the original method of updating the metadata store directly.\r\n\r\n### Pending items\r\n\r\n- Cluster testing\r\n\r\n### Changes not in this PR\r\n- Document updates\r\n- Web console changes to use new APIs\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nAdd new Overlord APIs to mark non-overshadowed segments as used\r\n- `POST /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}`\r\n- `POST /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/markUsed`\r\n- `POST /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/segments/{segmentId}`\r\n\r\nAdd new Overlord APIs to mark segments as unused:\r\n- `POST /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/markUnused`\r\n- `DELETE /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/segments/{segmentId}`\r\n- `DELETE /druid/indexer/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}`\r\n\r\nThe corresponding Coordinator APIs are being deprecated and will be removed in a future release:\r\n- `POST /druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}`\r\n- `POST /druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/markUsed`\r\n- `POST /druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/markUnused`\r\n- `POST /druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/segments/{segmentId}`\r\n- `DELETE /druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/segments/{segmentId}`\r\n- `DELETE /druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}`\r\n\r\nUntil they are removed, these Coordinator APIs will internally invoke respective Overlord APIs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nSince https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17466, the cron job ITs have been broken because they use `runtime_jdk: 21.0.4`:

Stopping\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because [docker_build_containers.sh](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/c1ef38b0526554bceedd78001aed8e9fb86ef126/integration-tests/script/docker_build_containers.sh#L29) is checking for Java version 21, but we are using 21.0.4, and hence it errors out.\r\n\r\nAdding 21.0.4 in the if-condition won't help, since there's no `openjdk:21.0.4-slim-buster` image.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `runtime_jdk` to `17` to fix the cron job ITs for now. We can revisit this later on exploring other possible options for which docker image to use for 21.0.4.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR contains non-functional / refactoring changes of the following classes in the `sql` module:\r\n\r\n1. Move `ExplainPlan` and `ExplainAttributes` from`sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/http`  to `processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/query/explain`\r\n2. Move `sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/SqlTaskStatus.java` -> `processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/query/http/SqlTaskStatus.java`\r\n3. Add a new class `processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/query/http/ClientSqlQuery.java` that is effectively a thin POJO version of `SqlQuery` in the `sql` module but without any of the Calcite functionality and business logic.\r\n4. Move `BrokerClient`, `BrokerClientImpl` and `Broker` classes from `sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/client` to `server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/client/broker`.\r\n5. Remove `BrokerServiceModule` that provided the `BrokerClient`. The functionality is now contained in `ServiceClientModule` in the `server` package itself which provides all the clients as well.\r\n\r\nThis is done so that we can reuse the said classes in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17353 without brining in Calcite  and other dependencies to the Overlord.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-06T03:07:52Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T05:57:20Z","closed_at":"2024-12-06T17:32:03Z","merged_at":"2024-12-06T17:32:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a2220c68d5ce9f8443106f448c38c739929993d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

and addressed some issues of https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17406\r\n\r\nCurrently, using the query context, all joins in a query can be hinted to either broadcast or sort merge join. However, this does not allow this to be set at a join level.\r\n\r\nAdd support for hints to queries, which can dictate the join type. \r\n\r\n### Syntax\r\n```\r\nselect /*+ sort_merge */ w1.cityName, w2.countryName\r\nfrom\r\n(\r\n  select /*+ broadcast */ w3.cityName AS cityName, w4.countryName AS countryName from wikipedia w3 LEFT JOIN wikipedia-set2 w4 ON w3.regionName = w4.regionName\r\n) w1\r\nJOIN wikipedia-set1 w2 ON w1.cityName = w2.cityName\r\nwhere w1.cityName='New York';\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\nCalcite does not expose if the hint is at a particular join level, and allows inheritance of hints from parent nodes. This causes join hints to to affect inner queries. Additional join hints can be added to inner queries as a workaround.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n- Add join hints to SQL join queries. This allows queries to hint the join type that should be used at a per join level. Join hints recursively affect sub queries.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR.

the LifecycleStop method of SupervisorManager (SupervisorManager.stop()) can take a long time to run. This is because the method iterates through all running supervisors and calls stop on them serially. Each streaming supervisor.stop() call tries to push a ShutdownNotice to its notice queue and then wait for the ShutdownNotice to run and set stopped = true up to tuningConfig.shutdownTimeout. This means the total run time can be the sum of tuningConfig.shutdownTimeout (default 80 seconds) across all supervisors.\r\n\r\nThis long stop time can cause lots of issues, most notably overlord leadership issues if the ZK leader is terminated (but the ensemble maintains quorum). This is because a overlord pod can get becomeLeader queued up behind stopLeader if it disconnects and then reconnects to ZK (the giant lock shared between the two methods).\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to ensure SupervisorManager completes faster to prevent this issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- In SupervisorManager use a static pool of shutdownThreads to stop supervisors in parallel in the stop method to prevent a single or few slow supervisors from slowing down overall shutdown.\r\n- In SeekableStreamSupervisor, when stopGracefully is false (as it is when we are shutting down SupervisorManager), don't wait for the ShutdownNotice to run. This means that the recordSupplier (e.g. kafka consumer) may not be cleaned up immediately, but since all the supervisor objects are dereferenced and can be GC'd later i don't think this is a huge deal.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n- I used a static thread pool in SupervisorManager for now, it's possible it should be configurable but IMO the main point of the thread pool is to not let a few slow supervisor shutdowns run in series block the entire supervisor manager from shutting down. **(changed in review)**\r\n- I'm not sure if changing the SeekableStreamSupervisor.stop method when stopGracefully = false is necessary, but it didn't make sense to me to specify a non-graceful shutdown and then try to wait for things to clean up. **(changed in review)**\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nImprove recovery time for overlord leadership after zk nodes are bounced.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SupervisorManager`\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisor`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#15942\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR updates the Apache Druid documentation to highlight a breaking change in Kubernetes service discovery behavior introduced in version 29. Specifically, the format of the timestamps used in the `<cluster-identifier>-leaderelection-coordinator` and `<cluster-identifier>-leaderelection-overlord` ConfigMaps was updated to a new format that was not documented. This change caused errors during leader election and service discovery due to mismatched date parsing expectations.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to ensure that users upgrading to version 29 are aware of this breaking change and can make the necessary adjustments to avoid issues in their Druid clusters.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Changes\r\nAdded a note in the Upgrade notes documentation for version 29 about the updated date format in ConfigMaps.\r\nProvided an example of the command required to help users update their clusters accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Release Note\r\nThis PR updates the documentation to warn users about a breaking change in Kubernetes service discovery introduced in version 29. The date format in leader election ConfigMaps (`<cluster-identifier>-leaderelection-coordinator` and `<cluster-identifier>-leaderelection-overlord`) was updated to a stricter ISO-8601-like format. Users should ensure they delete the old config mapss once upgrade to version 29.0.0 and above so they are recreated with the correct date format.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nKey changed/added classes in this PR  \r\nDocumentation updates only, no code changes.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #17337 and https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/17212#discussion_r1797155803.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis PR Fixes Cached Lookup Module documentation\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

improvment around segment publishing when multiple tasks in the same task group are pending completion.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIt's possible for the following timeline to occur for a single supervisor.\r\n\r\nTask 1 goes into publishing, Task 2 is started\r\nSupervisor is updated or handoff is triggerred manually\r\nTask 2 goes into publishing and immediately publishes (it has not read many events).\r\nTask 2 fails because the offsets in the DB do not match (Task 1 has not completed its SegmentTransactionalInsertAction yet).\r\n\r\nNormally task 2 will fail with one of the below errors:\r\n`The new start metadata state[%s] is ahead of the last committed\"\r\n          + \" end state[%s]. Try resetting the supervisor`\r\n\r\n`Inconsistency between stored metadata state[%s] and target state[%s]. Try resetting the supervisor.`\r\n\r\nEventually Task 1 will publish and the supervisor will get itself sorted out but this can lead to several minutes of downtime and lag (and many failed tasks) as the supervisor tries to recover.\r\n\r\nThis fix attempts to address this issue by having the SegmentTransactionalInsertAction check whether a task can actually publish before trying.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nThe general approach here is to introduce a canPublishSegments method on each supervisor, and then call this method each time a streaming task wants to publish. If this method returns false, then throw a 503 error that the task will then retry.\r\n\r\nA alternative approach might be to only try this as a fallback (right now this logic has to be run on every publish). But I thought this might introduce consistency bugs since part of the publish logic would have ran and failed and the logic introduced here is relatively simple (checking stuff in memory). I can update the logic to be exception handling only if others have strong opinions.\r\n\r\nThe canPublishSegments logic is only implemented on SeekableStreamSupervisor and essentially looks at pendingCompletionTaskGroups to see if there is already a task publishing (if the task is in pendingCompletionTaskGroups, that indicates it is already publishing) with earlier offsets then the task that is trying to publish.\r\n\r\nI'm still working on some unit tests for this code.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nQOL improvment for resubmitting supervisors or for when task publishing takes a long time.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisor`\r\n * `SupervisorManager`\r\n * `SegmentTransactionalInsertAction`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixed a non deterministic test in `org.apache.druid.indexing.kafka.supervisor.KafkaSupervisorSpecTest.testSerdeWithSpecAndInputFormat`\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nTo reproduce the problem, first build the module `kafka-indexing-service`:\r\n\r\n> mvn install -pl extensions-core/kafka-indexing-service -am -DskipTests\r\n\r\nThen, run the regular test:\r\n\r\n> mvn -pl extensions-core/kafka-indexing-service test -Dtest=org.apache.druid.indexing.kafka.supervisor.KafkaSupervisorSpecTest#testSerdeWithSpecAndInputFormat\r\n\r\nTo identify the flaky test, execute the following [nondex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) command:\r\n\r\n> mvn -pl extensions-core/kafka-indexing-service edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.druid.indexing.kafka.supervisor.KafkaSupervisorSpecTest#testSerdeWithSpecAndInputFormat\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe testSerdeWithSpecAndInputFormat was producing non-deterministic output because the JSON object used in the test did not include a parser that enforced a specific order, unlike other tests. Due to the inherent non-deterministic nature of JSON serialization, this resulted in inconsistent outputs. The dimension spec array gave non deterministic order on different runs as follow- \r\nexpected: `\"dimensionExclusions\":[\"timestamp\",\"value_min\",\"count\",\"value_sum\",\"__time\",\"value\",\"value_max\"]` \r\nactual: `\"dimensionExclusions\":[\"value_min\",\"count\",\"value_sum\",\"value\",\"value_max\",\"timestamp\",\"__time\"\"] `.\r\n\r\nThe fix involves adding a parser to the JSON like the other tests to ensure a consistent order.  \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#17420 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe changes here try to reduce metadata IO during segment allocation by fetching segment payloads\r\nfor only the required segments. For other segments, only fetching the segment ID suffices.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Add Overlord runtime property `druid.indexer.tasklock.batchAllocationReduceMetadataIO`.\r\n- Setting this flag to true (default value) allows the Overlord to fetch only necessary segment payloads during segment allocation\r\n- Settings this flag to false restores original segment allocation behaviour\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nAdd Overlord runtime property `druid.indexer.tasklock.batchAllocationReduceMetadataIO`.\r\nSetting this flag to true (default value) allows the Overlord to fetch only necessary segment payloads during segment allocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

Description\r\nAdd metric to track Kafka message production rate which can be useful for correlating with Kafka lag. For each collection period, the latest Kafka broker offset is compared with the previous minute to calculate the production rate.\r\n\r\nOne interesting use case is being able to use this metric to roughly calculate lag as time. This can be done by calculating the time `t` such that  `sum(time = now to t) of productionRate = lag` i.e. how many minutes of production equals the current lag.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new streaming ingest metric `ingest/kafka/partitionProduction`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamingSupervisor`\r\n * `KafkaSupervisor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nAdded a taskStatus dimension to the service/heartbeat metric. This can be used to detect cases when a particular task has been reporting its heartbeat in a particular state for an unusually long time; for example if a streaming task is stuck in paused state. Only tasks derived from SeekableStreamIndexTask report their taskStatus with this metric for now, other task types do not.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#6647  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is built upon #6683 and #9172 and aims to reduce the number of ZooKeeper watch counts. \r\n\r\n#### Fixed Huge Number of Watches in ZooKeeper\r\n\r\nThe current `Announcer.java` leverages on Apache Curator's [PathChildrenCache](https://curator.apache.org/docs/recipes-path-cache). In its present form, the announcement mechanism watches the immediate parent of the specified path. This results in all child nodes under the parent path being monitored by the ZooKeeper ensemble, including sibling nodes and children of the specified path. This causes an unnecessarily large number of ZooKeeper watches to be produced. \r\n\r\nThe new `NodeAnnouncer.java` class is simply `Announcer.java` but leverages on [NodeCache](https://curator.apache.org/docs/recipes-node-cache) instead to watch a single node during announcement. By eliminating the watches on child nodes, this approach significantly reduces the total number of watch counts in ZooKeeper. \r\n\r\nTests conducted on the production server also indicate a decrease in watch counts resulting from this change.\r\n\r\n![ZK Watch Count](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bf479a7-9e5c-4554-b99b-ea8b1f4ded3a)\r\n\r\nAn additional add-on is that while `Announcer.java` is partially replaced in the previous two PRs, this PR replaces all instances of `Announcer.java` (See reason below). Should the reviewers feel it is ok to remove the entire `Announcer` class, I would be happy to do so.\r\n\r\nThe use of the two different announcer classes simultaneously may result in a `KeeperException.NotEmptyException`. This happens when two nodes are sharing the same parent, and since both announcers do not have a full picture of the nodes it is watching, the exception will be thrown when the following occurs:\r\n1. `Announcer` removes all of its tracked children nodes.\r\n2. Thinking that after all the removal the parent node has no children anymore, `Announcer` tries to remove the parent node.\r\n3. If `NodeAnnouncer` is still watching one or more child node, the attempt by `Announcer` in removing the parent node will result in the exception. \r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\n- Remove [humor](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/6683#discussion_r239161626) in error logs. \r\n- Add JavaDocs and comments within code to better describe the process.\r\n\r\n#### Refactoring\r\n\r\n- Shift `Announceable` class in `Announcer.java` to `Announceable.java`.\r\n- Refactor long methods by creating helper functions.\r\n- Add `ZKPathsUtils.java` to abstract the retrieval of ZooKeeper path and ZooKeeper node.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nImproved: ZooKeeper no longer spins up an unnecessary large number of watches when running realtime tasks.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Announcer.java`\r\n * `NodeAnnouncer.java`\r\n * `Announceable.java`\r\n * `AnnouncerModule.java`\r\n * `ZKPathsUtils.java`\r\n\r\n##### Classes that use NodeAnnouncer in favour of Announcer.java\r\nThe following classes have switched to using `NodeAnnouncer.java` instead of `Announcer.java`:\r\n- `CuratorDruidNodeAnnouncer.java`\r\n- `WorkerCuratorCoordinator.java`\r\n- `BatchDataSegmentAnnouncer.java`\r\n- `CuratorDataSegmentServerAnnouncer.java`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
