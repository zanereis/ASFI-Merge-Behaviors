Since the column is used to store JSON, and the values can be quite large, any JSON with more than 65535 that is stored will be truncated, becoming invalid.\r\n\r\nI added a migration script to change the type to long text in MySQL. I also wrapped the decoding of the column in a try/except block to prevent locking users out of SQL Lab in case the JSON is malformed (though it shouldn't happen again after this fix). I also added code to the frontend to handle the description being null; in that case the table is not show in SQL Lab, since we don't have the required information.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER

in the migration due to the tables created by example import and some schema drift that has happened over time. This PR ignores the tables created by the example import, applies a small number of database changes, and updates a number of models to resolve the situation. After merging this PR, generating a new Alembic migration should result in an empty file, or one with only the intended changes after a model update.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

The queries run here are selecting 100K rows from the **birth_names** table in the example datasets._\r\n\r\n- Instantiation of the new `SupersetTable` object in SQL Lab was slightly faster than `SupersetDataFrame` at **99.72444661ms** vs **124.0594076ms**, respectively.\r\n- Memory usage for the PyArrow.Table (**5659776 bytes**) was _significantly_ lower than the Pandas DataFrame (**22259209 bytes**).\r\n- Serialization for async queries is where the biggest performance gains are. PyArrow performed better in nearly all metrics, with the following standouts:\r\n  - On `master`, serialization/deserialization of the dataframe via `json` takes an average of **~7750ms**\r\n  - Pyarrow (with `msgpack` disabled) reduces this cycle to **~2850ms**\r\n  - Enabling `msgpack` in the serialization workflow further reduces this to **~1700ms**, representing a **~78% performance improvement**.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-03T19:15:45Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:43:34Z","closed_at":"2020-01-03T16:55:40Z","merged_at":"2020-01-03T16:55:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"6537d5ed8c11c061ee966d88b7bce772ac635227","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1332384320,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMyMzg0MzIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XXL","name":"size/XXL","color":"5A30DA","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [X] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe `timeFormat` extraction function works as `group by` field but does not work as `filter` field.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"extraction\",\r\n  \"dimension\": \"__time\",\r\n  \"outputName\": \"dayOfMonth\",\r\n  \"extractionFn\":{\r\n    \"type\" : \"timeFormat\",\r\n    \"format\" : \"d\",\r\n    \"timeZone\" : \"Asia/Kolkata\",\r\n    \"locale\" : \"en\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf we use this custom column as `filter` field, Superset gives `Unsupported extraction function: timeFormat` error.\r\n\r\n### FIX:\r\nI have used existing `TimeFormatExtraction` from `pydruid` to support this. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n- Create custom druid column as mentioned above.\r\n- Use the column as filter in any chart. We have checked this for `Line Chart` and `Big number with Trendline Chart`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\n### What:\r\n* Updates the way Superset deals with Docker.\r\n* Updates the local docker-compose setup\r\n* Moves docker stuff out of `contrib` and into `docker`, making it a little more \"first-class\"\r\n* Dockerfile is now more production ready\r\n* Splits development work into several helper containers (init, node, worker) as opposed to one uber container\r\n* Removes node from final image\r\n* Builds in a multi-stage way in order to minimize final size\r\n\r\n### Why:\r\n* We would like to start building/pushing prod-ready Docker images that will mirror the Apache release cycles\r\n\r\n### What's next:\r\n* CI will be hooked up to start building the `Dockerfile` and then push it up somewhere that it can be used by everyone\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-03T01:35:00Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:43:29Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T18:37:19Z","merged_at":"2019-12-03T18:37:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"fce49680d75d84c9c9267ccba5688bc7f4673e66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\npandas removes `None` values when doing a groupby or a pivot, so we have to substitute a value for `None`s beforehand to allow null values in the bar chart's series or breakdown. There is already a string `\"<NULL>\"` being used to indicate nulls in a few places, so I used that and centralized it in a new `constants.py` file.\r\n\r\nFixes #8672 \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\npandas removes `None` values when doing a groupby or a pivot, so we have to substitute a value for `None`s beforehand to allow null values in the bar chart's series or breakdown. There is already a value `\"<NULL>\"` being used in a few places, so I used that and centralized it in a new `constants.py` file.\r\n\r\nFixes #8672 \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS\r\n<!--- Skip

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where if the filter box referenced an obsolete value it would throw an exception when trying to sort the values (see before and after). Afterwards the error is shown, e.g. `Metric 'count' does not exist' however it is not apparent which filter this applies to as undefined values are filtered out from the set of options. \r\n\r\nThe solution is to add any saved values to the default options. Note ideally there would be some frontend validation which would propagate upwards and thus prevent the query from being run in the first place.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe have two variables in `config.py` that are used exclusively for the cache warmup celery task:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nSUPERSET_WEBSERVER_ADDRESS = \"0.0.0.0\"\r\nSUPERSET_WEBSERVER_PORT = 8088\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe change from `requests` to `urllib` broke the task, since `urllib` requires a protocol in addition to the host and port.\r\n\r\nI fixed it by adding a new variable to `config.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nSUPERSET_WEBSERVER_PROTOCOL = \"http\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd using that variable when composing the URL.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to

\"filter_immune_slices\": [324, 65, 92],\r\n  \"expanded_slices\": {},\r\n  \"filter_immune_slice_fields\": {\r\n    \"177\": [\"country_name\", \"__time_range\"],\r\n    \"32\": [\"__time_range\"]\r\n  },\r\n  \"timed_refresh_immune_slices\": [324]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nImported it, and verified that the new dashboard has `filter_immune_slice_fields`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIf you made the window really small and adjusted the sql editor height, it would autolock to the minHeight (200px) which was > 100% of the screen size. Then you could never resize it again because the sql editor height would be saved to localstorage.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that the panes are always resized to at least the minHeight (200px) and also sets a min height to the whole page so that you can never make the editor 100% of the page\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/69990137-f64ee800-14f9-11ea-9ca1-b7655e013ffb.png)\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/69990561-be947000-14fa-11ea-95c0-984ab9c478e8.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nMake the window min height, resize the pane, then make the window larger again. See that you can still drag the gutter. Also make sure that when reloading the page you can drag the gutter\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

Per [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/druid-development/3HcW91YsT5Y) it seems that Druid internally treats `NULL` values and empty strings as same and thus the fix is to make the comparison value simply an empty string.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nMany BI applications, particularly in multi-tenancy scenarios, require support for row-level security. That is, the ability to show different slices of a table to users based on some user attribute.   To accomplish this, I've added a new model to describe row level security filters, which references a Table and a Role. So when adding a row level security filter, you specify a particular Role and Table.\r\n\r\nWhen querying that table, the applicable filters are added to the query.  I've modified the query function [here](https://github.com/altef/incubator-superset/commit/ab6ae456daecd34e676273fa4d43c52875e00e94#diff-6506def3966137541a05177a6fb169d7R981-R987) to add any relevant to the WHERE clause.\r\n\r\nAs well, I've added a UI for managing the row level security filters.  And for convenience, added it as a related view for tables.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n ![menu-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4316295/69895421-dba32600-12e3-11ea-85fb-bfbffd36abd0.JPG)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n1. Row level security filters added to the Security menu:\r\n![menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4316295/69893637-5743a980-12c9-11ea-8020-1f87f0c46c5d.jpg)\r\n\r\n2. Row level security list\r\n![list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4316295/69893640-6c203d00-12c9-11ea-9962-81a320ffc2cd.jpg)\r\n\r\n3. Row level security interface\r\n![edit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4316295/69893642-76dad200-12c9-11ea-8070-22f6f5f1d8cc.jpg)\r\n\r\nThat allows for the management of the RowLevelSecurityFilters model.  Additionally, for convenience, I've added it as a related view for tables.\r\n\r\n![table-related-view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4316295/69893652-a25dbc80-12c9-11ea-9f57-d2ec6b609315.jpg)\r\n\r\nAfter logging in with a user assigned to that role, I can still supply additional filters:\r\n\r\n![additional-filters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4316295/69893666-c91bf300-12c9-11ea-9504-6c1a20727307.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe generated SQL includes the additional filters AND the clause supplied by the row level security filter(s).\r\n\r\n![generated-sql](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4316295/69893678-e6e95800-12c9-11ea-82f6-5fe9160a7510.jpg)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nEverything seems to be working as expected on my end, but a few things should be done to verify the changes.\r\n\r\n1. Set up a limited user\r\n   1. Create a new role and give it access to a table.\r\n   2. Create a new user and assign it the ``Gamma`` role, as well as the role you've just created.\r\n   3. Create a ``Row level security filter`` and assign it the table and row.\r\n2. Ensure that the table is still working as expected for you (there should be no change)\r\n3. Create a simple dashboard built on that table\r\n4. Verify the limited user is only seeing the filtered data \r\n   1. Log in as the limited user\r\n   2. Check the table to ensure the filter is being applied.\r\n   3. Check the dashboard to ensure the data is being limited.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: [#8644 ](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/8644)\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [x] Requires DB Migration. \r\n    - To add a new model.)\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested. \r\n    - I tested it, but presumably this doesn't  apply to me?\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [X] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nImplements part (to keep PR size manageable) of SIP-31.\r\nThis implementation adds base CRUD endpoints for dashboards, has planned I custom implemented POST and PUT methods.\r\n\r\nPOST and PUT use a customized Superset marshmallow schema that implements serialization, deserialization and validation of data. The `post` and `put` methods are basically identical to FAB's implementation, they are generic enough, so later (or now) we can create a specific Superset implementation to serve future API implementations.\r\n\r\nThe `info` endpoint is disabled, this endpoint serves information about:\r\n- User's permission for the REST resource (can_list, can_add, can_edit, etc...)\r\n- Possible supported filters for the REST resource\r\n- Information to generically render an Add/Edit form and well as paginated data for related fields (To populate dropdowns)\r\n\r\nWon't create permissions:\r\n- DashboardModelView.can_list\r\n- DashboardModelView.can_show\r\n- DashboardModelView.can_edit\r\n- DashboardModelView.can_add\r\n- DashboardModelView.can_delete\r\n\r\nRequest and Responses for non custom endpoints:\r\n- GET `/api/v1/dashboard/`\r\nRequest query parameters accepts Rison or serialized JSON with the following structure:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"columns\":  [<LIST OF COL NAMES TO FETCH>]\r\n    \"filters\": [\r\n       { \"col\": \"<COL_NAME>\", \"opr\": \"<FILTER_NAME>\", \"value\": <VALUE> }, ...\r\n    ]\r\n    \"keys\": [<SELECT SPECIFIC METADATA KEYS ON RESPONSE>]\r\n    \"order_column\": \"<COL_NAME>\",\r\n    \"order_direction\": \"asc\" | \"desc\"\r\n    \"page\": integer\r\n    \"page_size\": integer\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"count\": <RESULT_COUNT\">\r\n    \"ids\": [ ... List of PK's ordered by result ... ],\r\n    \"description_columns\": {},\r\n    \"label_columns\": {},\r\n    \"list_columns\": [ ... An ordered list of columns ...],\r\n    \"order_columns\": [ ... List of columns that can be ordered ... ],\r\n    \"list_title\": \"\",\r\n    \"result\": []\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that `label_columns`, `description_columns` and `list_title` response is internationalized.\r\n`result` is a list of objects inferred from the model and only contains the fields declared on `DashboardRestApi.list_columns`\r\nexample:\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n      \"creator\": \"<a href=\\\"/superset/profile/admin/\\\">admin user</a>\",\r\n      \"dashboard_link\": \"<a href=\\\"/superset/dashboard/8/\\\">test1_changed</a>\",\r\n      \"modified\": \"<span class=\\\"no-wrap\\\">5 hours ago</span>\",\r\n      \"published\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- GET `/api/v1/dashboard/<id>`\r\nRequest query parameters accepts Rison or serialized JSON with the following structure:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"columns\":  [<LIST OF COL NAMES TO FETCH>]\r\n    \"keys\": [<SELECT SPECIFIC METADATA KEYS ON RESPONSE>]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"id\": \"<Primary Key>\"\r\n    \"description_columnns\": {},\r\n    \"label_columns\": {},\r\n    \"show_columns\": [],\r\n    \"show_title\": \"\",\r\n    \"result\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`result` is an object inferred from the model and only contain the fields declared on `DashboardRestApi.show_columns`\r\nexample:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"charts\": [],\r\n    \"css\": null,\r\n    \"dashboard_title\": \"test4\",\r\n    \"json_metadata\": null,\r\n    \"owners\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"id\": 1,\r\n        \"username\": \"admin\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"position_json\": null,\r\n    \"published\": false,\r\n    \"slug\": null,\r\n    \"table_names\": \"\"\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- DELETE `/api/v1/dashboard/<id>`\r\n\r\n- POST `/api/v1/dashboard/`\r\nRequest example payload:\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"css\": \"some css\",\r\n  \"dashboard_title\": \"title1\",\r\n  \"json_metadata\": \"{\\\"A\\\":\\\"a\\\"}\",\r\n  \"owners\": [\r\n    1, 2\r\n  ],\r\n  \"position_json\": \"\",\r\n  \"published\": true,\r\n  \"slug\": \"some slug\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Response:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": 12,\r\n  \"result\": {\r\n    \"css\": \"some css\",\r\n    \"dashboard_title\": \"title1\",\r\n    \"json_metadata\": \"{\\\"A\\\":\\\"a\\\"}\",\r\n    \"position_json\": \"\",\r\n    \"published\": true,\r\n    \"slug\": \"some-slug\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- PUT `/api/v1/dashboard/<id>`\r\nRequest payload for PUT has the same fields has PUT but supports partial updates, example:\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n  \"dashboard_title\": \"title1_changed\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nResponse:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"result\": {\r\n    \"css\": \"some css\",\r\n    \"dashboard_title\": \"title1_changed\",\r\n    \"json_metadata\": \"{\\\"A\\\":\\\"a\\\"}\",\r\n    \"position_json\": \"\",\r\n    \"published\": true,\r\n    \"slug\": null\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFully detailed requests and responses for all endpoints are declared by OpenAPIv3 and can be nicely visualized on /swaggerviews/v1  \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ]

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nI noticed that when you use the button to test a DB connection, the API just responds with \"OK\" and not a list of tables. That may be an issue worth exploring, or maybe it was changed for a good reason. In any case, there was some Javascript that was bugging out in trying to process/display a list of tables from that \"OK\" so I made this display logic conditional, such that it will only run if an array of tables is indeed returned. I doubt that will ever happen, but at least this PR kills the console error in any case.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@mistercrunch

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that only the relevant time widgets are included depending on the chart type. Previously the granularity logic was shown even if the chart type did not support granularity, i.e., non-timeseries charts. \r\n\r\nThis provides a number of benefits including: \r\n\r\n1. Improved UX: It's not apparent to the user that these controls have no impact on the chart.\r\n2. Improved performance: The controls serve as inputs to the cache and thus the cache is invalidated when these erroneous options are changed. \r\n3. Cleaner form-data: The impetus for this change stemmed from a project migrating charts from Druid NoSQL to SQL where there isn't a 1:1 mapping for the time parameters. The erroneous values could deem a chart is non-migratable even though in theory is was.\r\n\r\nAdditionally this PR also removes the time controls for chart types which don't support time filtering, i.e., iFrame, Markup, etc.\r\n\r\nNote erroneous form-data fields are removed on load in explorer but will persist in database until the slice is re-saved.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis is the first step in a larger effort to convert the superset frontend to a single page app. This PR introduces react router under the `/welcome` component. The next step is to replace `/dashboard/list` view with a react component and have react router handle routing between these pages. \r\n\r\nEventually we'll move all the views under react router, which should make subsequent page loads faster. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- Welcome page renders exactly as on master. \r\n- Navigation works on that page to any other page. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen estimating the cost of queries using Presto we currently pass only the actual estimate to `query_cost_formatter`. I modified it so it passes the full response from Presto, which allows us to log which table(s) and partition(s) are being queried.\r\n\r\nBasically, instead of returning `response[\"estimate\"]` this PR makes it return `response`, and the formatter will extract the estimate. Custom formatters defined in `superset_config.py` will have access to the full response, including `inputTableColumnInfos`.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip

`@gray-light`. I renamed the one ones the Bootstrap/Bootswatch side to have a `@bs-...` prefix to namespace them for now. Hopefully all is looking more like it ought to now.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

rendering of static pages when using `gevent`, but the `20.0.2` version has been tested to work well with `gevent` and from behind an SSL terminated LB (this didn't work with `gunicorn==19.9.x`).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis adds a tool to aid local plugin development/debugging by linking all of the packages in the `superset-ui-plugins` repo. A new npm script, `plugin-devmode-on`, `npm link`s all the superset-ui-plugins. A new webpack config detects any npm linked superset-ui-plugins, and automatically changes imports for those plugins to import from `/src`. This makes a [whole series of steps](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/master/docs/debugging.md) unnecessary. You can set the location to use for the repo with the env variable `SUPERSET_UI_PLUGINS_PATH`.\r\n\r\nAnother npm script `plugin-devmode-off` undoes the changes of `plugin-devmode-on` by running `npm ci`.\r\n\r\n*This is not entirely working, just yet.* The `BoxPlotChartPlugin` in `@superset-ui/preset-chart-xy` plugin is imported by reaching into the `/esm/legacy` directory. This breaks, because webpack rewrites it to look for `src/esm/legacy`, which does not exist. We propose to solve this by either modernizing the plugin (no idea how easy/difficult that is), or splitting it into a legacy version and a non-legacy version, so that we don't need to reach inside a build folder to import the chart. Input would be appreciated from anyone with more insight into the history of that plugin.","created_at":"2019-11-23T02:04:34Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T21:04:49Z","closed_at":"2020-03-19T21:04:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"854b6e561f4cdae4f4110530b0121693e5604f7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1315743105,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzE1NzQzMTA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/.pinned","name":".pinned","color":"FEF2C0","default":false,"description":"Draws

and view logic (http request handlers, template rendering, response construction, etc) is hyper-coupled to the business logic. In our case, we need to setup alternate endpoints with different internal auth, routes, etc to use the `sql_json`, `queries`, and `results` endpoints from `views.core.Superset`.  I think these should be more thoroughly decoupled (ie, views just doing view stuff, and calling into a completely separate library for business logic) but that is a lot more than I can chew off right now, so this tiny change is simply breaking those three http request handlers off so we other functions can call into the business logic from different endpoints.\r\n\r\nChoose one##** BEFORE/AFTER

It should actually be `>=`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the time lag is 7 days and there are 7 data points, there should be an error because there are only 6 days in between the first and last day. However, this error was not caught, so users saw:\r\n\r\n`An error occurred while rendering the visualization: TypeError: Cannot read property 'Unknown' of undefined`\r\n\r\nFixed viz to include the `=` case.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nNarrow date range to include `n` points. Add a comparison column with a time lag of `n`. Ensure that you get the correct error.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@graceguo-supercat @michellethomas @etr2460

This now shows only the last 8 characters for reference (1 more than github!). It also adds a colon after \"Version\" for consistency, and a little more line height and bottom padding on the fine print so it's less claustrophobic.\r\n\r\nOpen TODO: make the fine print act like a little menu item, and copy the full SHA on click.\r\nOpen TODO?: move the \"admin user\" tooltip seen in the screenshot into the menu. Not sure if we need the tooltip. Thoughts, anyone?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/69257367-cf92c800-0b6f-11ea-88d3-8360bb5fe512.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-20T16:29:12Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:42:39Z","closed_at":"2019-12-04T21:13:52Z","merged_at":"2019-12-04T21:13:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"b107cc03bfc205fa87c01d9d9fee0e7febbed137","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis is pretty minor, but just something I noticed while looking around. Since Superset uses FontAwesome, we can replace a custom component with custom SVG by using a simple FontAwesome image.\r\n\r\nWe should probably upgrade to FontAwesome 5 at some point... many more toys in that toybox!\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/69118503-9449a980-0a48-11ea-8a49-22f12b1ecfd8.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/69118473-7f6d1600-0a48-11ea-8d92-46852a455eb3.png)\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@graceguo-supercat / @mistercrunch \r\n**Note:** This doesn't change any functionality, but as far as I can tell, that button doesn't have functionality in the first place, or at least nothing happens when I click it. Is it for future use, or am I missing

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we call `select_star` for a SQL Lab view the generated SQL is incorrect. Eg, if we have the following query in SQL Lab:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM ab_permission_view_role\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we go to Explore view and click \"Explore in SQL Lab\" in the datasource dropdown we'll get something like:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM superset.`Beto Dealmeida-Untitled Query 2-_HgL-mU8p`\r\nLIMIT 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe query fails because there's no table called `Beto Dealmeida-Untitled Query 2-_HgL-mU8p`.\r\n\r\nI fixed `select_star` so that when the datasource has the `sql` attribute it's used as the source of the `FROM`, instead of the table name. This produces:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM\r\n  (SELECT *\r\n   FROM ab_permission_view_role) AS `Untitled Query 2-_HgL-mU8p`\r\nLIMIT 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

below. This PR fixes that issue. This PR also adds more consistent margins to those toolbar items, whether linewrapped or not, with simplified CSS (e.g. less utilization of utility classes).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFriday we turned on the `SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE` at Lyft, and noticed a deadlock when migrating SQL Lab tabs from `localStorage` to the backend:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (1213, 'Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction')\r\n[SQL: INSERT INTO tab_state (created_on, changed_on, extra_json, user_id, label, active, database_id, `schema`, `sql`, query_limit, latest_query_id, autorun, template_params, created_by_fk, changed_by_fk) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)]\r\n[parameters: (datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 16, 1, 39, 45, 903405), datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 16, 1, 39, 45, 903410), '{}', '1963', 'dim_applicants', 1, 7, None, 'select * from events_annotated.event_ride_requested limit 10', None, None, 0, None, 1963, 1963)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that there was no data loss, and the tabs were migrated successfully on a refresh.\r\n\r\nI tried to repro this locally, migrating 20 tabs to a MySQL database, but I wasn't able to hit the deadlock. Looking at the code, it seems that we reuse the same session across all requests, so I refactored it to create a new session for each request.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch do you think this would fix the problem? I'm not super familiar with SQL Alchemy, but from what I read this should work.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF -->\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to repro the original bug, but ran this code to ensure that it still works.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ]

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**Before:**\r\nWith the growing size of the dashboard, user may want to apply one dashboard filter to some of charts in dashboard, and one filter apply to another set of charts. A very common use case is user groups similar charts in different tabs, and make a filter only applicable for this group. Currently the way to set filter's scope is not very easy to use:\r\n<img width=\"1140\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2019-10-16_at_9_49_54_AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/66944436-00785e00-f002-11e9-81c1-5b16aa6ba6ae.png\">\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n1. Start filter scope selector:\r\n![jwMsJ1jNea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/69028924-5e44f080-0988-11ea-8954-347fb5c89240.gif)\r\n\r\n2. User can edit a single filter, or edit multiple filter fields all together. We also allow user toggle back to a single filter field in the multi-edit mode:\r\n![PtIvVuSV6s](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/69029436-c47e4300-0989-11ea-9368-b0bda0413b80.gif)\r\n\r\n3. Search chart name:\r\n![d2ZfBriTy2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/69029719-9baa7d80-098a-11ea-9f3f-e8dbda3f53b0.gif)\r\n\r\n4. When new chart is added to dashboard, based on its layout position, it will get filters that are applicable to its tab(s):\r\n![NvggG46SWb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/69032554-a7e60900-0991-11ea-8d9c-14fe0dbcd53b.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n5. When user move charts between tabs, this may cause chart to be applicable to different filter(s). We will show a warning message when chart is moved to a different filter scope.\r\n![MVYXjUXxDr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/69031530-25f4e080-098f-11ea-9051-bfd7d77be1ae.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual test.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWe do not apply filter on filter_box itself, so in the scope selector modal, the filter_box's checkbox is disabled. But when user clicks on tab or other parent level node's checkbox, react-checkbox-tree framework still set the value for disabled nodes. So sometimes this will cause confusing. For example: in the UI no chart is selected but the root show half-checked:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/68974317-4f521880-07a5-11ea-8c14-3ee2f96fc653.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR will add an extra logic that enforce filter_box's state is unchecked, but still show as disabled. This is still not **_perfect_**, because when user checked parent's checkbox, they are expected to see all children nodes are also checked. In this case, filter_box's state is still unchecked. \r\n\r\nThere is a proposal that to compare all the nodes under the parent, and ignore the filter_box's state. The data structure for all nodes state are in the tree structure. In order to igore the filter_box's state, I need to have a filter_box chartId, then find its parent, and find other siblings in the tree. This computation is not cheap, and will be triggered very frequent.\r\n\r\nGiven the performance impact is big and UI in-consistency is small, I propose this cheaper solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST

code snippet:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmax_value = Math.max(...some_array);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if `some_array` is big this will trigger the error `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`, since the number of arguments passed to the function `Math.max` is too big.\r\n\r\nI fixed it by using `reduce` instead.\r\n\r\n<!-- ### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF
