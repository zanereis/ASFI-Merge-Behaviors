PR introduces the `multinomial` random operator. It's a neat adaptation of `random.uniform` that allows weighted selection of indices from a probability tensor. This op is used in new Dalle-like architectures to generate random images. The PR provides a topi implemenation and tests, relay integration, and an initial pytorch integration. I did not implement sampling without replacement at this time as it seems complicated to do as a tensor operation.","created_at":"2022-08-03T05:53:35Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:57:17Z","closed_at":"2022-08-08T17:51:52Z","merged_at":"2022-08-08T17:51:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"b79f9501fdba5cf286f015277aeae867081b77df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12284/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12284/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12284/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7850be34ce099548af71f0c067b7b5eec4b14368","head":{"label":"jwfromm:torch_multinomial","ref":"torch_multinomial","sha":"7850be34ce099548af71f0c067b7b5eec4b14368","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

`__shfl_down_sync` in the if-then-else case, but we can decide whether the returned value is used.\r\n\r\nOnly the first shuffle call needs range check considering the procedure. (the \"dirty\" values will not affect thread 0). Therefore, this fix only brings little performance overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addiction, there is no need to check when performing the full warp reduce.\r\n\r\nAn additional unit test for `max` reduction is also added to `tests/python/unittest/test_subwarp_reduction_cuda.py`.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @junrushao1994  @yzh119

we use ANSI color sequences to highlight TVM script. In jupyter notebook environments, such color sequence will be recoginized and translated to corresponding HTML to display things. \r\n\r\nThis works fine for most notebook environments (including the jupyter notebook and the VS Code plugin). Recently, thanks to @tqchen, we found that Google Colab does not well support ansi color sequence for 24-bit colors (`JupyterLight` and `VSCDark`) that all its displayed colors are unexpectedly black/gray/white. To also bring highlighting in Colab, in this PR, we directly render the highlighted code with HTML when a notebook environment is detected.\r\n\r\ncc: @tqchen @Hzfengsy

PR solves two issues:\r\n\r\n1. The compatibility of libstdc++ CXX11 ABI. \r\n    Currently, the official PyTorch distribution uses old symbols from libstdc++, which conflicts with the symbols used by TVM. The issue was discussed [here](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/can-someone-please-give-me-the-steps-to-use-pt-tvmdsoop/12525) before. \r\n    We address this issue by compiling the code snippets involving TVM and Torch separately, with their right libstdc++ CXX ABI. The TVM-related codes ([RuntimeModuleWrapperTVM.cc](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12232/files#diff-3cb0a7daf9d8032f468f8fda43a9f0a2a94f7c7cd8126c9d6f09b4a805c3c2d0)) are built under the new CXX11 ABI, while the Torch-related codes ([RuntimeModuleWrapperTorch.cc](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12232/files#diff-7a2704d021b5f88143cedfbc3bb2b24d289c3616112c0c1e1dc61c29f1881e19)) are built under the same CXX11 ABI as the installed PyTorch, and linked together by a pure C header ([runtime_bridge.h](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12232/files#diff-6b8efa6b4cc714cb50d042cccc4c268cc54cc827d832eda1395885a372cd9b12)).\r\n\r\n2. The lack of the support of boolean tensor.\r\n    Currently, If we tried to use `optimze_torch` with an input of boolean tensor, it will fail because it’s not supported by DLPack (https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack/issues/75). We might want to work around it since some models use boolean tensor.\r\n    We address this issue by extending the DLTensor with an extra `is_bool` field, guiding us to convert NDArray and DLTensor with the correct type. If the DLTensor is not boolean, the behavior of data transformation is the same as the previous codes.\r\n\r\n@yelite @masahi @junrushao1994

main idea is to construct some handshake mechanism which can help to check that TVM executor obtained from pre-compiled libraries and other files is corresponded to given model.\r\n\r\nThere is a part implementation of the idea. Onnx model is assumed only. Virtual Machine is used only.\r\n\r\nThe feature is switched on by special argument `get_hash` in `from_onnx` method, it is False by default. The pipeline is the following: 1. hash calculation (sha256 algorithm is used) from onnx model file. 2. Saving it inside VM lib 3. The hash can be extracted from VM lib or write in file by it with other exported files (see below).\r\n\r\nOne important thing which should be highlighted: we do not know anything about onnx model when VM is compiled. It means we can not directly generate hash from it inside compilation method. Due to this in current implementation the hash is generated on line №1 (see below) and saved in IRModule. After that on line №2 it is saved on VM side. \r\nOf course, there is another way to workaround this problem. It is to transfer responsibility of the hash generation and setting it to VM on client side, but it looks not friendly and convenient.\r\nThere is pipeline of VM compilation and exporting:\r\n```\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\nmod, params = relay.frontend.from_onnx(onnx_model, freeze_params=True, get_hash = True) # №1\r\nvm_exec = relay.vm.compile(mod, target)                                                 # №2\r\ncode, lib = vm_exec.save()\r\n# Save shared lib file.\r\ntmp = tvm.contrib.utils.tempdir()\r\npath_lib = tmp.relpath(\"lib.so\")\r\nlib.export_library(path_lib)\r\n# Save ro-file\r\nwith open(tmp.relpath(\"code.ro\"), \"wb\") as fo:\r\n    fo.write(code)\r\n# Save weights\r\nvm_exec.move_late_bound_consts(consts_path, byte_limit=256)\r\n# SAVE MODEL HASH in hash.txt file\r\nvm_exec.save_hash(tmp)\r\n```\r\nThere are two scenarios how the hash can be gotten:\r\n```\r\n# GET MODEL HASH FROM TXT FILE\r\nhash_path = os.path.join(tmp, \"hash.txt\")\r\nwith open(hash_path, \"r\") as f:\r\n    hash = f.read()\r\n# Load VM exec.\r\nloaded_lib = tvm.runtime.load_module(path_lib)\r\nloaded_code = bytearray(open(tmp.relpath(\"code.ro\"), \"rb\").read())\r\ndes_exec = tvm.runtime.vm.Executable.load_exec(loaded_code, loaded_lib)\r\n# GET MODEL HASH FROM VM LIB\r\nhash = des_exec.hash\r\n\r\ndes_vm = tvm.runtime.vm.VirtualMachine(des_exec, dev)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nProcedure of hash calculation:\r\n```\r\nimport hashlib\r\nonnx_model_hash = hashlib.sha256(onnx_model.SerializeToString()).hexdigest()\r\n```\r\n\r\nImportant points which can be developed in the future:\r\n1. It is done for VirtualMachine only. It can be easy extended for GraphExecutor\r\n2. It is assumed that onnx model used for pre-compiled library. It requires more careful and considered approach for extraction of model format independent information (instead of or together with hash) for further check.\r\n3. It looks like TVM design did not initialy assume such feature. Due to this the hash is saved in IRModule which is assumed as immutable. I think if it is developed further, updates in TVM design also should be considered in details.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-29T08:36:20Z","updated_at":"2022-11-23T07:36:41Z","closed_at":"2022-11-23T07:36:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"af1623d7b434241a9100fcdc6fc25d1f9e3c1401","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12231/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12231/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12231/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8bf9e64ede62e19326618438fe9819a1f1613989","head":{"label":"Deelvin:vc/onnx_model_hash","ref":"vc/onnx_model_hash","sha":"8bf9e64ede62e19326618438fe9819a1f1613989","user":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321290323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjEyOTAzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Deelvin/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin/tvm","description":"Open
