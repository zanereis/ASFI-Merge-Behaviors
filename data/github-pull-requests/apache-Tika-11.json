Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>HttpHeaders.setAllHttpHeaders(HttpHeaders)</code> to provide a way to efficiently combine two <code>HttpHeaders</code>.</li>\n<li>Added <code>CoreUtils.parseQueryParameters</code> to efficient parse query parameters without array overhead found with <code>String.split</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breaking

Changes</h2>\n<p>Regression fixes from Maven 3.9.0. General performance and other fixes.</p>\n<h2>Potentially Breaking Core Changes (if migrating from 3.8.x)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Maven Resolver transport has changed from Wagon to “native HTTP”, see <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-resolver-transport.html\">Resolver Transport guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maven 2.x was auto-injecting an ancient version of plexus-utils dependency into the plugin classpath, and Maven 3.x continued doing this to preserve backward compatibility. Starting with Maven 3.9, it does not happen anymore. This change may lead to plugin breakage. The fix for affected plugin maintainers is to explicitly declare a dependency on plexus-utils. The workaround for affected plugin users is to add this dependency to plugin dependencies until issue is fixed by the affected plugin maintainer. See <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-6965\">MNG-6965</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mojos are prevented to boostrap new instance of RepositorySystem (for example by using deprecated ServiceLocator), they should reuse RepositorySystem instance provided by Maven instead.
