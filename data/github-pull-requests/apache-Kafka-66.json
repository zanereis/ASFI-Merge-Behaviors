PR is to be reviewed after #12337.\r\n\r\nIn order to integrate with the state updater, we would need to refactor the TaskManager and Task interfaces. This PR achieved the following purposes:\r\n\r\n1. Separate active and standby tasks in the Tasks placeholder, plus adding `pendingActiveTasks` and `pendingStandbyTasks` into Tasks. The exposed active/standby tasks from the Tasks set would only be mutated by a single thread, and the pending tasks hold for those tasks that are assigned but cannot be actively managed yet. For now they include two scenarios: a) tasks from unknown sub-topologies and hence cannot be initialized, b) tasks that are pending for being recycled from active to standby and vice versa. Note case b) would be added in a follow-up PR. \r\n\r\n2. Extract any logic that mutates a task out of the Tasks / TaskCreators. Tasks should only be a place for maintaining the set of tasks, but not for manipulations of a task; and TaskCreators should only be used for creating the tasks, but not for anything else. These logic are all migrated into TaskManger.\r\n\r\n3. While doing 2) I noticed we have a couple of minor issues in the code where we duplicate the closing logics, so I also cleaned them up in the following way:\r\na) When closing a task, we first remove it from Tasks, and the trigger the corresponding `closeClean/Dirty` function; for active task, we also remove its task producer if EOS-V1 is used.\r\nb) For closing dirty, we swallow the exception from `close` call and the `remove task producer` call; for closing clean, we store the thrown exception from either `close` call or the `remove task producer`, and then rethrow at the end of the caller. The difference though is that, for the exception from `close` call we need to retry close it dirty; for the exception from the `remove task producer` we do not need to re-close it dirty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

 I have come across [this comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2170?focusedCommentId=17477226&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17477226) by [Maksim Zinal](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=mzinal).\r\n\r\n> I've created a quick patch which seems to fix the issue on my system and on the Kafka version I use (2.8.0).\r\n> \r\n> I believe that the reason of lock failures is the use of RandomAccessFile Java API to open the files in some cases, while in other cases FileChannel.open() is used instead. When opening files with RandomAccessFile under Windows, FILE_SHARE_DELETE flag is not set, which leads to \"access denied\" errors when trying to rename or delete the open files. FileChannel.open() sets the FILE_SHARE_DELETE by default, as I checked on JDK 8 and 11.\r\n> \r\n> Here's the link to the branch based on tag 2.8.0: https://github.com/zinal/kafka/tree/2.8.0_KAFKA-1194\r\n> \r\n> Here are the exact changes implemented: https://github.com/zinal/kafka/compare/2.8.0...zinal:2.8.0_KAFKA-1194 (plus jcenter and grgit stuff needed to run the build).\r\n\r\nThis change addresses some \"access denied\" errors which occur on Windows.\r\n[KAFKA-1194](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1194), [KAFKA-2427](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-2427), [KAFKA-6059](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6059), [KAFKA-6188](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6188), [KAFKA-6200](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6200), [KAFKA-7575](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7575), [KAFKA-8145](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8145), [KAFKA-9458](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9458)\r\n\r\nStackowerflow\r\n[45141541](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45141541/kafka-topic-data-is-not-getting-deleted-in-windows), [45599625](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45599625/kafka-unable-to-start-kafka-process-can-not-access-file-00000000000000000000), [48114040](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48114040/exception-during-topic-deletion-when-kafka-is-hosted-in-docker-in-windows), [50755827](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50755827/accessdeniedexception-when-deleting-a-topic-on-windows-kafka), [67555122](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67555122/getting-java-nio-file-accessdeniedexception-on-kafka-on-windows)\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nI deployed Kafka 2.8.1. with the original patch provided by [Maksim Zinal](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=mzinal) in January on ~50 Windows servers. Each Kafka instance has only one queue. Several processes per Kafka instance write their logs in to the queue and one process reads the queue and processed the data.\r\n\r\nIt seems that [these issues mentioned on stackowerflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45599625/kafka-unable-to-start-kafka-process-can-not-access-file-00000000000000000000) by Windows users are gone.\r\n\r\nI am currently testing Kafka 3.3. with the latest version of the patch which was modified according to @divijvaidya requests.\r\n\r\nKafka 3.3. log files\r\n\r\n- [controller.log](https://github.com/apache/kafka/files/9072570/controller.log)\r\n- [server.log](https://github.com/apache/kafka/files/9072571/server.log)\r\n- [log-cleaner.log](https://github.com/apache/kafka/files/9072572/log-cleaner.log)\r\n\r\nYou can see in the logs that Kafka managed to delete timeindex files. \r\n\r\nThank you for your

[KAFKA-14010](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14010)\r\n\r\nWhen `Partition#submitAlterPartition` submits ISR update and send out the Alter_Isr request, we'll register a callback with `Future.whenComplete` [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/cluster/Partition.scala#L1585). Later, when the Alter_Isr response received, we use `try/finally` to first trigger the callback, and remove the `unsentIsrUpdates` later [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/AlterPartitionManager.scala#L362-L369). Because of this, inside the callback, when we found there is retriable error, we'll retry, but then, we found there's an \"in-flight\" reqeust because `unsentIsrUpdates` is not removed, which causes the retry didn't actually send out successfully.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I did:\r\n1. fix the above described bug by removing the `unsentIsrUpdates` before calling callback. I've confirmed in the callback, we never care about the status of `unsentIsrUpdates`.\r\n~~2. Currently, when we tried to enqueue an ISR update failed due to there's `unsentIsrUpdates`, we throw out `OperationNotAttemptedException`, and later, we'll treat it as no-op from controller, so, we will not retry and also change the state to \"committed\" [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/cluster/Partition.scala#L1631), which is unexpected. Change it to `IllegalStateException`, so that we'll treat it as \"other exception\", and will retry this ISR update.~~\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

introduced topic ids in the AlterPartitionRequest/Response and we just found a bug in the request handling logic. The issue is the following.\r\n\r\nWhen the `AlterPartitionManager` receives the response, it builds the `partitionResponses` mapping `TopicIdPartition` to its result. `TopicIdPartition` is built from the response. Therefore if version < 2 is used, `TopicIdPartition` will have the `ZERO` topic id. Then the `AlterPartitionManager` iterates over the item sent to find their response. If an item has a topic id in its `TopicIdPartition` and version < 2 was used, it cannot find it because one has it and the other one has not.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue by using `TopicPartition` as a key in the `partitionResponses` map. This ensures that the result can be found regardless of the topic id being set or not.\r\n\r\nNote that the case where version 2 is used is handled correctly because we already have logic to get back the topic name from the topic id in order to construct the `TopicPartition`.\r\n\r\n`testPartialTopicIds` test was supposed to catch this but it didn't due to the ignorable topic id field being present. This patch fixes the test as well.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

PR allows us to support connecting the metadata shell to a live KRaft quorum via --controller,\r\nas specified in the original KIPs. In order to do this, the PR factors out a \"MetadataShellSource\"\r\ninterface which is implemented by both a snapshot file and a live quorum.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the \"shell\" gradle submodule dependend on \"core.\" This extended the gradle build time\r\nbecause \"core\" takes a long time to build.  It also tended to reduce the encapsulation of the\r\nshell. This PR makes \"core\" depend on \"shell\" instead. In order to support this, the new entry\r\npoint for the tool is kafka.tools.MetadataShellTool rather than\r\norg.apache.kafka.shell.MetadataShell.\r\n\r\nRaftManager.scala: make close() idempotent, as it is for nearly everything else. This makes cleanup\r\nlogic easier.","created_at":"2022-06-20T13:53:12Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T03:35:16Z","closed_at":"2025-01-27T03:35:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

are some considerata embedded in this seemingly straight-forward PR that I'd like to explain here. The StreamPartitioner is used to send records to three types of topics:\r\n\r\n1) repartition topics, where key should never be null.\r\n2) changelog topics, where key should never be null.\r\n3) sink topics, where only non-windowed key could be null and windowed key should still never be null.\r\n\r\nAlso, the StreamPartitioner is used as part of the IQ to determine which host contains a certain key, as determined by the case 2) above.\r\n\r\nThis PR's main goal is to remove the deprecated producer's default partitioner, while with those things in mind such that:\r\n\r\n1) We want to make sure for not-null keys, the default murmur2 hash behavior of the streams' partitioner stays consistent with producer's new built-in partitioner.\r\n2) For null-keys (which is only possible for non-window default stream partition, and is never used for IQ), we would fix the issue that we may never rotate to a new partitioner by setting the partition as `null` hence relying on the newly introduced built-in partitioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

Problem to be solved\r\n  - log.cleaner.io.max.bytes.per.second cannot be changed dynamically using bin/kafka-configs.sh\r\n  - For details, problem cause, reproduction procedure etc, refer to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13996\r\n\r\n- Implementation:\r\n  - Add updateDesiredRatePerSec() on Throttler\r\n  - Call updateDesiredRatePerSec() of Throttler with new log.cleaner.io.max.bytes.per.second value in reconfigure() of Log Cleaner\r\n  - I implemented the feature to be similar to [reconfigure() of SocketServer](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/fa59be4e770627cd34cef85986b58ad7f606928d/core/src/main/scala/kafka/network/SocketServer.scala#L336-L357)\r\n\r\n- Alternative implementation considered (not adopted):\r\n  - re-instantiate Throttler with new log.cleaner.io.max.bytes.per.second value in reconfigure() of Log Cleaner \r\n    - However, since many parameter specifications are required to instantiate Throttler, I chose to be similar to SocketServer and update only log.cleaner.io.max.bytes.per.second\r\n\r\n- Test:\r\n  - Added unit test in case of updating DesiredRatePerSec of Throttler\r\n  - I confirmed by manual testing that log.cleaner.io.max.bytes.per.second can be changed using bin/kafka-configs.sh:\r\n      - With this implementation, log.cleaner.io.max.bytes.per.second for Log Cleaner works as expected.\r\n      >   [2022-06-15 22:44:03,089] INFO [kafka-log-cleaner-thread-0]:\r\n        Log cleaner thread 0 cleaned log my-topic-0

pull request addresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14001. It is the first of a series of pull requests which address the move of Kafka Streams tests from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5.\r\n\r\n_The below description is kept to track the history of this pull request._\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is the first part of KAFKA-7342 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7342). Here are the decisions I made in this change:\r\n* Do not (yet) migrate files using Parameterized because they require more in-depth changes. A list of the files which I haven't changed can be found here (1).\r\n* Prefix assertTrue, assertFalse, assertNull etc. with Assertions.\r\n* Run IntelliJ's Optimize Imports and streams:spotlessApply on the streams module.\r\n\r\n1. List of untouched tests. Once these are migrated then JUnit4 should no longer be used in Kafka

Problem #1 in DelegatingClassLoader.java\r\nAtomicity violation in example such as:\r\nConsider thread T1 reaches line 228, but before executing context switches to thread T2 which also reaches line 228. Again context switches to T1 which reaches line 232 and adds a value to the map. T2 will execute line 228 and creates a new map which overwrites the value written by T1, hence change done by T1 would be lost. This code change ensures that two threads cannot initiate the TreeMap, instead only one of them will.~~\r\n\r\n## Problem #2 in RocksDBMetricsRecordingTrigger.java\r\nAtomicity violation in example such as:\r\nConsider thread T1 reaches line 40 but before executing it context switches to thread T2 which also reaches line 40. In a serialized execution order, thread T2 should have thrown the exception but it won't in this case. The code change fixes that.\r\n\r\nNote that some other problems associated with use of concurrent hashmap has been fixed in

detailed description of your change*\r\n\r\nThe reason for KAFKA-13959 is a little complex, the two keys to this problem are:\r\n1. `KafkaRaftClient.MAX_FETCH_WAIT_MS==MetadataMaxIdleIntervalMs == 500ms`. We rely on fetchPurgatory to complete a FetchRequest, in details, if `FetchRequest.fetchOffset >= log.endOffset`, we will wait for 500ms to send a FetchResponse.\r\n2. The follower needs to send one more FetchRequest to get the HW.\r\n\r\nHere are the event sequences:\r\n1. When starting the leader(active controller) LEO=m+1(m is the offset of the last record), leader HW=m(because we need more than half of the voters to reach m+1)\r\n2. follow(standby controller) and observer(broker) send FetchRequest(fetchOffset=m)\r\n3.1. leader receives FetchRequest, set leader HW=m and waits 500ms before send FetchResponse\r\n3.2. leader send FetchResponse(HW=m)\r\n3.3 broker receive FetchResponse(HW=m), set metadataOffset=m.\r\n4. leader append `NoOpRecord`, LEO=m+2. leader HW=m\r\n5. looping 1-4\r\n\r\nIf we change MAX_FETCH_WAIT_MS=200(less than half of MetadataMaxIdleIntervalMs), this problem can be solved temporarily. \r\n\r\nWe plan to improve this problem in 2 ways, firstly, in this PR, we change the controller to unfence a broker when the broker's high-watermark has reached the broker registration record for that broker. Secondly, we will propagate the HWM to the replicas as quickly as possible in KAFKA-14145.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

a reassignment is cancelled, the controller must send `StopReplica` to all Adding replicas to ensure that the partition state is removed. Currently, this does not necessarily result in a bump to the leader epoch, which means that the `StopReplica` may be ignored by the Adding replica due to [KIP-570](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-570%3A+Add+leader+epoch+in+StopReplicaRequest). When this happens, the partition becomes stray and must be manually cleaned up.\r\n\r\nWe fix the problem here by ensuring that the leader epoch is bumped when a replica transitions to `OfflineReplica` even if the replica is not a leader or in the current ISR.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

patch does two things to tighten up races during bootstrap. One is to simply move the volatile write until after the \"bootstrapMetadata\" event has been enqueued. The other thing is to prepend \"bootstrapMetadata\" to the queue.\r\n\r\nFrom the JIRA, this test was flaky when we see the \"registerBroker\" event precede the \"boostrapMetadata\" event\r\n\r\n```\r\nhandleLeaderChange() start\r\nappendWriteEvent(registerBroker)\r\nappendWriteEvent(bootstrapMetadata)\r\nhandleLeaderChange() finish\r\nregisterBroker() -> writes broker registration to log\r\nbootstrapMetadata() -> writes bootstrap metadata to log\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test harness in QuorumControllerTest is polling the controllers to see when their current leader epoch matches the expected leader epoch\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        QuorumController activeController() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        AtomicReference<QuorumController> value = new AtomicReference<>(null);\r\n        TestUtils.retryOnExceptionWithTimeout(20000, 3, () -> {\r\n            LeaderAndEpoch leader = logEnv.leaderAndEpoch();\r\n            for (QuorumController controller : controllers) {\r\n                if (OptionalInt.of(controller.nodeId()).equals(leader.leaderId()) &&\r\n              --->  controller.curClaimEpoch() == leader.epoch()) { <---\r\n                    value.set(controller);\r\n                    break;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if (value.get() == null) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(String.format(\"Expected to see %s as leader\", leader));\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        return value.get();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch, we were setting the `curClaimEpoch` volatile before scheduling the \"bootstrapMetadata\" event. This creates a race where the test code can see the controller as active before the bootstrap metadata has been enqueued. By moving the volatile write after the \"bootstrapMetadata\" event enqueueing, we can eliminate this race.\r\n\r\nIn production, there is nothing stopping clients from making requests to a controller that is in the process of starting up. Once the socket server begins processing requests, we will begin seeing events on the QuorumController queue. The check for active controller is done when events are processed, so we could have events enqueued at any time. By prepending the \"bootstrapMetadata\" event, we can ensure any events that see the controller as active will come after the bootstrap metadata has been processed.\r\n\r\nIf we handle a \"registerBroker\" event before \"bootstrapMetadata\" is enqueued, then we are sure to see `curClaimEpoch = -1`. If a \"registerBroker\" is waiting in the queue while we finish bootstrapping, then we are sure to enqueue \"bootstrapMetadata\" before it. This means \"registerBroker\" (and any other event) is guaranteed to see the controller as inactive _or_ that it is active and the bootstrap metadata has been

detailed description of your change*\r\nThere are 3 bugs when a broker generates a snapshot.\r\n\r\n1. Broker should not generate snapshots until it starts publishing.\r\nBefore a broker starts publishing, `BrokerMetadataListener._publisher=None`,  so `_publisher.foreach(publish)` will do nothing, so `featuresDelta.metadataVersionChange().isPresent` is always true, so we will generating a snapshot on every commit since we believe metadata version has changed, here are the logs, note offset 1 is a LeaderChangeMessage so there is no snapshot:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2022-06-08 13:07:43,010] INFO [BrokerMetadataSnapshotter id=0] Creating a new snapshot at offset 0... (kafka.server.metadata.BrokerMetadataSnapshotter:66)\r\n[2022-06-08 13:07:43,222] INFO [BrokerMetadataSnapshotter id=0] Creating a new snapshot at offset 2...

(kafka.server.metadata.BrokerMetadataSnapshotter:66)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. We should compute `metadataVersionChanged` before `_publisher.foreach(publish)`\r\nAfter `_publisher.foreach(publish)` the `BrokerMetadataListener_delta` is always Empty, so `metadataVersionChanged` is always false, this means we will never trigger snapshot generating even metadata version has changed.\r\n\r\n3. We should try to generate a snapshot when starting publishing\r\nWhen we started publishing, there may be a metadata version change, so we should try to generate a snapshot before first publishing.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)*\r\nA unit test.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

have been seeing a lot of timeouts in `LogOffsetTest` when KRaft is enabled. The problem is the dependence on `MockTime`. In the KRaft broker, we need a steadily advancing time for events in `KafkaEventQueue` to get executed. In the case of the timeouts, the broker was stuck with the next heartbeat event in the queue. We depended on the execution of this event in order to send the next heartbeat and complete the `initialCatchUpFuture` and finish broker startup. This caused the test to get stuck during initialization, which is probably why the `@Timeout` wasn't working. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the test does not have a strong dependence on `MockTime`, so I have replaced it with system time.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

Another way of fixing [KAFKA-13563](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13563) other than https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11631. \r\n\r\nInstead of letting the consumer to always try to discover coordinator in pool with either mode (subscribe / assign), we defer the clearance of discover future upon committing async only. More specifically, under manual assign mode, there are only three places where we need the coordinator:\r\n\r\n* commitAsync (both by the consumer itself or triggered by caller), this is where we want to fix.\r\n* commitSync, which we already try to re-discovery coordinator.\r\n* committed (both by the consumer itself based on reset policy, or triggered by caller), which we already try to re-discovery coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are that for manual assign mode that does not try to trigger any of the above three, then we never would be discovering coordinator. The original fix in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11631 would let the consumer to discover coordinator even if none of the above operations are required.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

Set the minimum supported MetadataVersion to 3.0-IV1\r\n* Remove MetadataVersion.UNINITIALIZED\r\n* Relocate RPC version mapping for fetch protocols into MetadataVersion\r\n* Replace static IBP calls with dynamic calls to MetadataCache\r\n\r\nA side effect of removing the UNINITIALIZED metadata version is that the FeatureControlManager and FeatureImage will initialize themselves with the minimum KRaft version (3.0-IV1). \r\n\r\nThe rationale for setting the minimum version to 3.0-IV1 is so that we can avoid any cases of KRaft mode running with an old log message format (KIP-724 was introduced in 3.0-IV1). As a side-effect of increasing this minimum version, the feature level values decreased by one.

is another way of fixing KAFKA-13563 other than #11631.\r\n\r\nInstead of letting the consumer to always try to discover coordinator in pool with either mode (subscribe / assign), we defer the clearance of discover future upon committing async only. More specifically, under manual assign mode, there are only three places where we need the coordinator:\r\n\r\n1) commitAsync (both by the consumer itself or triggered by caller), this is where we want to fix.\r\n2) commitSync, which we already try to re-discovery coordinator.\r\n3) committed (both by the consumer itself based on reset policy, or triggered by caller), which we already try to re-discovery coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are that for manual assign mode that does not try to trigger any of the above three, then we never would be discovering coordinator. The original fix in #11631 would let the consumer to discover coordinator even if none of the above operations are required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-
