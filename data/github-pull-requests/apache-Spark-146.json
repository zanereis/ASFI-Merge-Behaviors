What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the support for extending user feature steps with configuration by adding 2 developer api:\r\n- `KubernetesDriverCustomFeatureConfigStep`: to help user extend custom feature step in executor side\r\n- `KubernetesExecutorCustomFeatureConfigStep`: to help user extend custom feature step in driver side\r\n\r\nBefore this patch user can only add feature step like:\r\n- `class TestStep extends KubernetesFeatureConfigStep`: without any kubernetes conf \r\n\r\nAfter this patch user can add feature step with configuration like:\r\n- `class TestStepWithDriverConf extends KubernetesDriverCustomFeatureConfigStep`: only driver\r\n- `class TestStepWithExecConf extends KubernetesExecutorCustomFeatureConfigStep`: only executor\r\n- `class TestStepWithK8SConf extends KubernetesDriverCustomFeatureConfigStep with KubernetesExecutorCustomFeatureConfigStep`: both driver and executor\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30206 , a developer API for custom feature steps has been added, but it didn't support initialize user feature step with kubernetes conf (like `KubernetesConf`/`KubernetesDriverConf`/`KubernetesExecutorConf`).\r\n\r\nIn most of scenarios, users want to make corresponding changes in their feature steps according to the configuration. Such as, the customized scheduler scenario, user wants to configure pod according to passed job configuration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nImprove the developer API for for custom feature steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added UT\r\n- Runing k8s integration test manaully: `build/sbt -Pkubernetes -Pkubernetes-integration-tests -Dtest.exclude.tags=minikube,r \"kubernetes-integration-tests/test`\r\n\r\nCloses:

Create a new function\r\n`CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION func AS c1 USING JAR jar1;`\r\n\r\n2. Once associated jar files are updated, enable dynamic update config and fire following command\r\n`CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY FUNCTION func AS c1 USING JAR jar1;`\r\n\r\nAbove query will update the classloaders and users will be able to use updated jars.\r\nWe can update both permanent and temporary functions.\r\n\r\n[Design Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XktLthq8FkjzgSMDMzmCm8JuNdhk9j5NQlFox-DVz90/edit?usp=sharing)\r\nA new configuration is added for this PR : `spark.sql.function.updateUdfResources`\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere is a TODO in `VersionsSuite`:\r\n\r\n- TODO: Refactor this to `HiveClientSuite` and make it a subclass of `HiveVersionSuite`\r\n\r\nthis pr completed this TODO, the main change as follows:\r\n\r\n- copy all test cases in `versions.foreach` scope of `VersionsSuite` to `HiveClientSuite`\r\n- override `nestedSuites` function in `HiveClientSuites` to use each hive version to test the cases in `HiveClientSuite` similar as `HiveClientUserNameSuites` and `HivePartitionFilteringSuites`\r\n- move other cases to `HiveClientSuites`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake `VersionsSuite` as a subclass of `HiveVersionSuite`  to unify the test mode of multi version hive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCanonicalization of AttributeReference should not remove nullability information of its dataType.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-38030 lists an issue where canonicalization of cast resulted in an unresolved expression, thus causing query failure. The issue was that the child AttributeReference's dataType was converted to nullable during canonicalization and hence the Cast's `checkInputDataTypes` fails. Although the exact repro listed in SPARK-38030 no longer works in master due to an unrelated change (details in the JIRA), some other codepaths which depend on canonicalized representations can trigger the same issue.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test to ensure that canonicalization preserves nullability of AttributeReference and does not result in an unresolved cast\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-26T05:32:57Z","updated_at":"2022-02-08T06:03:46Z","closed_at":"2022-02-08T05:55:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8460b5fe216ddf329d54d8522c6179f840a761e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6b77f66ce349b1b167e96f550f02e16c94c6088d","head":{"label":"shardulm94:SPARK-38030","ref":"SPARK-38030","sha":"6b77f66ce349b1b167e96f550f02e16c94c6088d","user":{"login":"shardulm94","id":6961317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjEzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94","html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":304161240,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDQxNjEyNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"shardulm94/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shardulm94","id":6961317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjEzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94","html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use Arrow < 7.0.0 (6.0.1 latest) for [IntegratedUDFTestUtils](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/IntegratedUDFTestUtils.scala), e.g., https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/inputs/udf for pandas UDFs.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR does not change the PyArrow and pandas used for PySpark test base because they are installed in the base image (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L290), and they are already using almost latest version (PyArrow 6.0.0, and pandas 1.3.3) so I think it's fine.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's better to test latest versions as they are likely more used by end users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test cases should cover.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-26T04:58:15Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:48Z","closed_at":"2022-01-26T06:55:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01384dcc065ba27f921cfbbba687b851079c9dea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f25d377fdc27ccf74c044ed10409b67bda5f2cfd","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:arrow-version-sql-test","ref":"arrow-version-sql-test","sha":"f25d377fdc27ccf74c044ed10409b67bda5f2cfd","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, in analyze partition command, we only update statistic about `Partition Statistics`, but won't update parameters in `Partition Parameters`,  the information such as `numFiles` is very useful for user, for compatibility with hive, we should update these two.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nKeep compatibility with hive\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAfter running analyze partition command, user can got latest statistic in partition parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use the following error classes for the parsing errors of lateral joins:\r\n- `INVALID_SQL_SYNTAX `\r\n- `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE `\r\n\r\nThese new error classes are added to `error-classes.json`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPorting the parsing errors for lateral join to the new error framework should improve user experience with Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change exposes Arrow Vector from `ArrowColumnVector`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn some cases we need to work with Arrow Vectors behind `ColumnVector` using Arrow APIs. For example, some Spark extension libraries need to consume Arrow Vectors. For now, it is impossible as the Arrow Vector is private member in `ArrowColumnVector`. We need to expose the Arrow Vector from `ArrowColumnVector`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAlthough SPARK-36614 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33868) fixed the UI issue, it made a regression where the `K8s integration test` has been broken and shows a wrong metrics and message to the users. After `Finished decommissioning`, it's still counted it as `unfinished`. This PR aims to fix this bug.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n22/01/25 13:05:16 DEBUG KubernetesClusterSchedulerBackend$KubernetesDriverEndpoint:\r\nAsked to remove executor 1 with reason Finished decommissioning\r\n...\r\n22/01/25 13:05:16 INFO ExecutorMonitor: Executor 1 is removed.\r\nRemove reason statistics: (gracefully decommissioned: 0, decommision unfinished: 1, driver killed: 0, unexpectedly exited: 0).\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\nRemove reason statistics: (gracefully decommissioned: 1, decommision unfinished: 0, driver killed: 0, unexpectedly exited: 0).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Pkubernetes -Pkubernetes-integration-tests

\"kubernetes-integration-tests/test\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\nThe corresponding test case hangs and fails.\r\n```\r\n[info] KubernetesSuite:\r\n...\r\n[info] *** Test still running after 2 minutes, 13 seconds: suite name: KubernetesSuite, test name: Test decommissioning with dynamic allocation & shuffle cleanups.\r\n// Eventually fails\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\n[info] KubernetesSuite:\r\n...\r\n[info] - Test decommissioning with dynamic allocation & shuffle cleanups (2 minutes, 41 seconds)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this is a regression bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually because this should be verified via the K8s integration test\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Pkubernetes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor current data source insert sql commit protocol, it have below problems:\r\n**case a**: both job A and job B write data into partitioned table TBL with different statistic partition, it will have conflict since they use same temp location ${table_location}/_temporary/0/....,\r\nwhen job A has finished and then it will clean this temp location, then cause job B’s temp data is cleared. Then it will cause  job B to fail to write data.\r\n**case b**: for current dynamic partition insert, if we kill a job writing data, will remain data under table location in the staging dir under table path.\r\n**case c**: If we use a dynamic partition insert to insert a new table with a huge number of partitions, we need to move partition path one by one, for this case, we can just rename stagingdir path to table path to make it more quicker. But if we want to do this, we need to make staging dir can be customized and should not use the staging path under table location.\r\n \r\nIn this approach, we plan to do two thing:\r\n\r\n1. Make staging dir can be customized like hive \r\n\r\n    - When we terminate a job doing dynamic partition insert, it will remain staging dir under table location . If  we make the staging dir can be customized like hive(such as define staging dir as /tmp/spark/.stagingdir ) can avoid remaining such staging dir and data under table path.\r\n\r\n    - If we define staging dir using a tmp location, not under table location, when we use dynamic partition insert to write data to a new table, we can just rename staging dir to target table location to avoid moving partition dir one by one. It’s more quickly.\r\n\r\n    - If we can customize staging dir,  we can implement a new commit protocol to enable use of staging dir to write non-partitioned table and static partition insert use staging dir and won’t increase FS operation.\r\n\r\n2. New SQL Commit protocol supports staging dir and won’t increase FS operation. \r\n\r\nFor current static partition insert in v1, it have step:\r\n\r\n    1. Task attempts firstly write files under the intermediate path, e.g. /path/to/outputPath/_temporary/{appAttemptId}/_temporary/{taskAttemptId}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet.\r\n\r\n    2. Then task commit file to /path/to/outputPath/_temporary/{appId}/_temporary/{taskId}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet.\r\n\r\n    3. Job commit move file to /path/to/outputPath/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet.\r\n\r\nFor current dynamic partition insert in v1, it have step:\r\n\r\n    1. Task attempts firstly write files under the intermediate path, e.g. /path/to/outputPath/.spark-staging-{jobId}/_temporary/{appAttemptId}/_temporary/{taskAttemptId}/a=1/b=1/xxx.parquet.\r\n    2. Then task commit file to /path/to/outputPath/.spark-staging-{jobId}/_temporary/{appId}/_temporary/{taskId}/a=1/b=1/xxx.parquet.\r\n   3. During Job commit move file to /path/to/outputPath/a=1/b=1/xxx.parquet.\r\n\r\nIn this new sql commit protocol **SQLPathHadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol** , \r\n\r\nfor non-partition insert:\r\n\r\n    1. Task attempts firstly write files under the intermediate path, e.g. {staging_dir}/_temporary/{appAttemptId}/_temporary/{taskAttemptId}/xxx.parquet.\r\n    2. Then task commit file to {staging_dir}/_temporary/{appId}/_temporary/{taskId}/xxx.parquet.\r\n    3. When job commit, moving file to /path/to/outputPath/xxx.parquet.\r\n \r\nfor all static partition insert:\r\n\r\n    1. Task attempts firstly write files under the intermediate path, e.g. {staging_dir}/_temporary/{appAttemptId}/_temporary/{taskAttemptId}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet.\r\n    2. Then task commit file to {staging_dir}/_temporary/{appId}/_temporary/{taskId}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet.\r\n    3. When job commit, moving file to /path/to/outputPath/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet.\r\n\r\nfor dynamic partition insert,  we implement it as:\r\n\r\n    1. Task attempts firstly write files under the intermediate path, e.g. {staging_dir}/_temporary/{appAttemptId}/_temporary/{taskAttemptId}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet.\r\n    2. Then task commit file to {staging_dir}/_temporary/{appId}/_temporary/{taskId}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet.\r\n    3. When job commit, move file to /{staging_dir}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet.  Then, if we write to a empty table path, we directly rename   /{staging_dir} to /{table_path}, if not, we move partition dir one by one from  /{staging_dir}/{part_spec_path} to  /{table_location}/{part_spec_path}\r\n\r\nThe new sql commit protocal’s benefit is:\r\n    - Can support Insert into non-partitioned table form it self\r\n    - Can support Insert into partition table's statistic partition and read data from target partition.\r\n    - Can support Insert into different partition using statistic partition concurrently \r\n\r\nThese are all  normal problems when we use data source API insert data\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvide a more flexible commit protocol and won't impact perf\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can set sql commit protocol to `SQLPathHadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol` to use a commit protocol with staging dir\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-25T11:30:09Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T00:31:59Z","closed_at":"2022-09-29T00:31:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea587bdee2b56f607696309a9be3a5176e1bc4e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6b44163f2ae0186fc3bd415352afb3df8f5883e3","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-36562","ref":"SPARK-36562","sha":"6b44163f2ae0186fc3bd415352afb3df8f5883e3","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `ExecutorMonitor.timedOutExecutors` method deterministic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince the AS-IS `timedOutExecutors` returns the result indeterministic, it kills the executors in a random order at Dynamic Allocation setting.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/18f9e7efac5100744f255b6c8ae267579cd8d9ce/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/dynalloc/ExecutorMonitor.scala#L58\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/18f9e7efac5100744f255b6c8ae267579cd8d9ce/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/dynalloc/ExecutorMonitor.scala#L119\r\n\r\nThis random behavior not only makes the users confusing but also causes a K8s decommission tests flaky like the following case in Java 17 on Apple Silicon environment. The K8s test expects the decommission of executor 1 while the executor 2 is chosen at this time.\r\n\r\n```\r\n22/01/25 06:11:16 DEBUG ExecutorMonitor: Executors 1,2 do not have active shuffle data

The CalendarInterval type is in the format of [(months: int, days: int, microseconds: long)](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/common/unsafe/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/unsafe/types/CalendarInterval.java#L58 ). However, the function above misses `days` field, and sets `microseconds` field in wrong position.\r\n\r\n`ColumnVectorUtils.populate()` is used by [Parquet](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/parquet/VectorizedParquetRecordReader.java#L258) and [ORC](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/orc/OrcColumnarBatchReader.java#L171) vectorized reader to read partition column. So technically Spark can potentially produce wrong result if reading table with CalendarInterval partition column. However I also notice Spark [explicitly disallows writing data with CalendarInterval type](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSource.scala#L586 ), so it might not be a big deal for users. But it's worth to fix anyway.\r\n\r\nCaveat: I found the bug when reading through the related code path, but I never encountered the issue in production for partition column with CalendarInterval type. I think it should be an obvious fix unless anyone more experienced could find some more historical context. The code was introduced a long time ago where I couldn't find any more info why it was implemented as it is (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11435)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFileCommitProtocol is the class to commit Spark job output (staging file & directory renaming, etc). During Spark 3.2 development, we added new functions into this class to allow more flexible output file naming. We didn’t delete the existing file naming functions (newTaskTempFile(ext) & newTaskTempFileAbsPath(ext)), because we were aware of many other downstream projects or codebases already implemented their own custom implementation for FileCommitProtocol. Delete the existing functions would be a breaking change for them when upgrading Spark version, and we would like to avoid this unpleasant surprise for anyone if possible. But we also need to clean up legacy as we evolve our codebase.\r\n\r\nSo for next step, I would like to propose:\r\n\r\nSpark 3.3 (now): Add @deprecate annotation to legacy functions in FileCommitProtocol - newTaskTempFile(ext) & newTaskTempFileAbsPath(ext).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nClean up codebase.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2022-01-25T06:25:29Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T00:59:52Z","closed_at":"2022-01-26T00:54:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d80ad4839cbdbc4e658905920c46fce80b7e86b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35311/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35311/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35311/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7a7aae1a076ce9f54cb90622b843dc02ab57c458","head":{"label":"c21:file-naming","ref":"file-naming","sha":"7a7aae1a076ce9f54cb90622b843dc02ab57c458","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to re-use one error class `UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE` in the following Spark's exceptions:\r\n- `QueryCompilationErrors.unsupportedIfNotExistsError` - when `IF NOT EXISTS` is not supported by `INSERT INTO`.\r\n- `QueryExecutionErrors.aesModeUnsupportedError` - when an user specify unsupported AES mode and padding.\r\n- `QueryExecutionErrors.literalTypeUnsupportedError` - impossible to create a literal from the input value (some Java class, for instance).\r\n- `QueryExecutionErrors.transactionUnsupportedByJdbcServerError` - the target JDBC server does not support transaction.\r\n\r\nAnd replace the following exceptions by `IllegalStateException` since they are internal, and should be not visible to users:\r\n- `QueryExecutionErrors.simpleStringWithNodeIdUnsupportedError` - a sub-class of `Expression` or `Block` doesn't implements the method `simpleStringWithNodeId()`.\r\n- `QueryExecutionErrors.dataTypeUnsupportedForWriterFuncError` - generating of a writer function for a struct field, array element, map key or map value doesn't support Catalyst's type.\r\n\r\nAlso, added new base test suite `QueryCompilationErrorsDSv2Suite` for testing DSv2 specific compilation error classes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReducing the number of error classes should prevent from explode of `error-classes.json`. Also, using one error class for similar errors should improve user experience with Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DataSourceV2SQLSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DataSourceV2DataFrameSessionCatalogSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DataFramePivotSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand the new test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsDSv2Suite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-01-24T17:29:52Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T10:31:57Z","closed_at":"2022-01-27T13:58:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9d7c26af5d761c8734c7cb1b0f303cfa6307d0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ff9a6a5ee217b793402912a60b0385f512a054f5","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:re-use-unsupported_feature-error-class","ref":"re-use-unsupported_feature-error-class","sha":"ff9a6a5ee217b793402912a60b0385f512a054f5","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis reverts commit c4a9772f741836cdb399e35a45b3b5df48d9eea6 which was merged in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34983 .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore this revert, there are two expected behaviors:\r\n1. **Can't submit application with specified namespace**\r\nthe driver pod would be stuck in `ContainerCreating` due to `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume \"spark-conf-volume-driver\" : configmap \"spark-drv-ed33d87e8b2eb017-conf-map\" not found`, because the configFileMap doesn't contains namespace info in driver side.\r\n\r\n2. **`configFileMap` doesn't allow `namespace` key as confimap.data** (but kubernetes doesn't have this limit).\r\n\r\nThe configmap of executor is still set correctly after revert this patch (the original PR solved case):\r\n```scala\r\n    // Create configmap in ns2 namespace\r\n    val builder2 = new ConfigMapBuilder()\r\n      .withNewMetadata()\r\n        // We don't specify ns2 in here like `.withNamespace(\"ns2\")`\r\n        .withName(\"configmap2\")\r\n      .endMetadata()\r\n      .addToData(\"testkey\", \"testvalue\")\r\n      .build()\r\n    val configMap2 = client.inNamespace(\"ns2\").resource(builder2).createOrReplace()\r\n    // the namespace is still set to ns2 as expected.\r\n    assert(configMap2.getMetadata.getNamespace === \"ns2\")\r\n```\r\nThat is even if we don't need to explicitly set the namespace for configmap.metadata, it will set correctly. That means we don't need the original PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manual test passed\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-submit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a flaky test `StreamingAggregationSuite.changing schema of state when restarting query`, via adjusting the number of shuffle partition to 1.\r\n\r\nThe flakiness was due to the optimization on schema verification - we only verify it in partition 0 since it is costly and redundant to verify the schema for all partitions. Other partitions are still possible to provide other errors which are considered as unexpected.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a flaky test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan test suite 10 times locally.","created_at":"2022-01-24T07:43:40Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T08:33:49Z","closed_at":"2022-01-24T08:33:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d9839fd5bc4e580bc74c6103e87a9e8173ba0b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR preserves columns with all values with `NaN`, `Null` or `None` to omit when saved to JSON files.\r\nChanges default behavior for `pyspark.pandas` JSON writer, from missing values are omitted, to missing values are preserved. This impacts output to file if there is any missing value in any field in any row. It can have significant (proportional to N * M, for N rows and M columns) impact in case of datasets (performance, storage cost).\r\nAdd an option to delete columns with all values with `NaN`, `Null` or `None` to omit when saved to JSON file.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPandas on spark deletes columns with all `None` values as default.\r\nPandas writes all columns to JSON even if the values are all `None`.\r\nThis is the same behavior as pandas users are used to.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe document for the `to_json` function is changed.\r\nThe `ignoreNullFields` option has been set to `False` as default to prevent columns with only `Null` to omit during saving to JSON files.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested manually.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndata = {'col_1': [3, 2, 1, 0], 'col_2': [None, None, None, None]}\r\ntest = ps.DataFrame.from_dict(data)\r\n\r\ntest.to_json(\"test.json\")\r\n\r\ntest2 =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr add a new logical plan(`PartialDistinct`) to support partially deduplicate input rows and use it push down limit through Aggregate if it is group only.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(10000L).write.saveAsTable(\"t1\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT DISTINCT * FROM t1 LIMIT 5\").explain(true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this pr:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nGlobalLimit 5\r\n+- LocalLimit 5\r\n   +- Aggregate [id#3L], [id#3L]\r\n      +- Relation default.t1[id#3L] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this pr:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nGlobalLimit 5\r\n+- LocalLimit 5\r\n   +- Aggregate [id#3L], [id#3L]\r\n      +- LocalLimit 5\r\n         +- PartialDistinct\r\n            +- Relation default.t1[id#3L] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\n`PartialDistinct` has other use cases.\r\n\r\nUse cases | Example query | Benefited queries\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nPartially deduplicate the right side of left semi/anti join | `SELECT  * FROM a WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM b)` | q10, q14a, q14b, q16, q23a, q23b, q35, q69, q94 , q95\r\nPush down partially deduplicate through join | `SELECT DISTINCT * FROM a JOIN b ON a.id = b.id` | q37, q38, q82, q87\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance by reduce shuffle data.\r\nBefore this PR | After this PR\r\n--- |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse `Aggregate.aggregateExpressions` instead of `Aggregate.output` when  pushing down limit 1 through Aggregate.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(10).selectExpr(\"id % 5 AS a\", \"id % 5 AS b\").write.saveAsTable(\"t1\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT a, b, a AS alias FROM t1 GROUP BY a, b LIMIT 1\").explain(true)\r\n```\r\nBefore this pr:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nGlobalLimit 1\r\n+- LocalLimit 1\r\n   +- !Project [a#227L, b#228L, alias#226L]\r\n      +- LocalLimit 1\r\n         +- Relation default.t1[a#227L,b#228L] parquet\r\n```\r\nAfter this pr:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nGlobalLimit 1\r\n+- LocalLimit 1\r\n   +- Project [a#227L, b#228L, a#227L AS

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI've added a DB2 specific truncate implementation that adds an IMMEDIATE statement at the end of the query.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI've encountered this issue myself while working with DB2 and trying to use truncate functionality.\r\nA quick google search shows that some people have also encountered this issue before:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/70027567/overwrite-mode-does-not-work-in-spark-sql-while-adding-data-in-db2\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30062\r\n\r\nBy looking into DB2 docs it becomes apparent that the IMMEDIATE statement is only optional if the table is column organized(though I'm not sure if it applies to all DB2 versions). So for the cases(such as mine) where the table is not column organized adding an IMMEDIATE statement becomes essential for the query to work.\r\nhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0053474.html\r\n\r\nAlso, that might not be the best example, but I've found that DbVisualizer does add an IMMEDIATE statement at the end of the truncate command. Though, does it only for versions that are >=9.7\r\nhttps://fossies.org/linux/dbvis/resources/profiles/db2.xml (please look at line number 473)\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt should not, as even though the docs mention that if the TRUNCATE statement is executed in conjunction with IMMEDIATE, it has to be the first statement in the transaction, the JDBC connection that is established to execute the TRUNCATE statement has the auto-commit mode turned on. This means that there won't be any other query/statement executed prior within the same transaction.\r\nhttps://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=statements-truncate (see the description for IMMEDIATE)\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/jdbc/JdbcRelationProvider.scala#L49\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/jdbc/JdbcRelationProvider.scala#L57\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/jdbc/JdbcUtils.scala#L108\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test case with slightly adjusted logic.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-22T19:59:16Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T03:45:07Z","closed_at":"2022-01-26T03:14:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84826c4798bc1b94e1eb6d58825fd1a0ae9688fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35283/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35283/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35283/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/79e298b0c56c97dfab6053491715d39ac0319f0f","head":{"label":"ikarol:SPARK-30062","ref":"SPARK-30062","sha":"79e298b0c56c97dfab6053491715d39ac0319f0f","user":{"login":"ikarol","id":16179864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc5ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16179864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol","html_url":"https://github.com/ikarol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":449408004,"node_id":"R_kgDOGslsBA","name":"spark","full_name":"ikarol/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ikarol","id":16179864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc5ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16179864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol","html_url":"https://github.com/ikarol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikarol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ikarol/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`Unpacking an archive s3a://zjx/python3.6.9.zip#python3 from /tmp/spark-d861d788-bd72-4d3c-88fc-8f79b30b081d/python3.6.9.zip to /opt/spark/work-dir/./python3 \r\nException in thread \"main\" java.io.IOException: Cannot run program \"python3/bin/python3\": error=13, Permission denied at java.base/java.lang.ProcessBuilder.start(Unknown Source) at java.base/java.lang.ProcessBuilder.start(Unknown Source) at org.apache.spark.deploy.PythonRunner$.main(PythonRunner.scala:97)`\r\n\r\nWhen we set parameter \"--archives s3a://zjx/python3.6.9.zip\" to submit the Spark job, driver will unzip it, but it will lost executable permission after unzipping, so we should keep those permission. In this PR, I add the executable permission for all file after unzipping. It may cost some time to unzip that, but the time cost is controllable. In the code submitted this time, I keep the permission information of the file in a collection, and then grant the permission to the file one by one after decompression. However, this is only for UNIX platforms. Zip decompression for non UNIX platforms skips the logic of granting permission. In this way, zip decompression can be realized normally.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen we submit a py job and want to use our own version of Python，we may add \"--archives s3a://zjx/python3.6.9.zip\" ,after driver unzip this file, and want to execute the program using python3, it will report permission denied. So we should add executable permission to those script. This keeps the permissions of tar and ZIP files the same.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter the fix, the zip package submitted by the user for Python will run normally.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37564 . I realize the agg build time metrics for sort aggregate is actually not correctly recorded. We don't have a hash build phase for sort aggregate, so there is really no way to measure so-called build time for sort aggregate. So here I make the change to back out the change introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34826 for agg build time metric.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo not report confusing SQL metrics `aggTime` for users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, because https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34826 is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe existing unit test introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34826

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to switch from specific error classes in the AES functions: `aes_encrypt()/aes_decrypt()` to more generic:\r\n- AES_CRYPTO_ERROR -> INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE\r\n- INVALID_AES_KEY_LENGTH -> INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE\r\n- UNSUPPORTED_AES_MODE -> UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE\r\n\r\nThe new error classes `INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE` and `UNSUPPORTED_MODE` are made to be re-used from other functions but not only in the AES functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.  To prevent unlimited inflation of the set of error classes and as a consequence of that inflation of `error-classes.json`.\r\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe metadata of a `GetStructField` expression is propagated in the `Alias` expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, in a dataframe with nested structs, when selecting an inner struct, the metadata of that inner struct is lost. For example, suppose\r\n`df.schema.head.dataType.head.metadata`\r\nreturns a non-empty Metadata object, then\r\n`df.select('Field0.SubField0').schema.head.metadata`\r\nreturns an empty Metadata object\r\n\r\nThe following snippet demonstrates the issue\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.Row\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.{LongType, MetadataBuilder, StructField, StructType}\r\nval metadataAbc = new MetadataBuilder().putString(\"my-metadata\", \"abc\").build()\r\nval metadataXyz = new MetadataBuilder().putString(\"my-metadata\", \"xyz\").build()\r\nval schema = StructType(Seq(\r\n  StructField(\"abc\",\r\n    StructType(Seq(\r\n      StructField(\"xyz\", LongType, nullable = true, metadataXyz)\r\n    )), metadata = metadataAbc)))\r\nimport scala.collection.JavaConverters._\r\nval data = Seq(Row(Row(1L))).asJava\r\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema)\r\n\r\nprintln(df.select(\"abc\").schema.head.metadata) // OK, metadata is {\"my-metadata\":\"abc\"}\r\nprintln(df.select(\"abc.xyz\").schema.head.metadata) // NOT OK, metadata is {}, expected {\"my-metadata\",\"xyz\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced in versions 3.2.0, 3.1.2 and 2.4.8\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new test\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-21T10:44:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T16:29:58Z","closed_at":"2022-03-21T16:28:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a975ba6dedadc12cd60aced78622f8a9994d4993","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35270/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35270/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35270/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/01ba9aa5d4b64e753ffe6f66fd6d481be1fb4109","head":{"label":"kevinwallimann:SPARK-34805","ref":"SPARK-34805","sha":"01ba9aa5d4b64e753ffe6f66fd6d481be1fb4109","user":{"login":"kevinwallimann","id":54136196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTM2MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54136196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinwallimann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":450149831,"node_id":"R_kgDOGtS9xw","name":"spark","full_name":"kevinwallimann/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinwallimann","id":54136196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTM2MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54136196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinwallimann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinwallimann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinwallimann/spark","description":"Apache

implement of `to_char` in `Oracle` that give a strict parameter verification.\r\nSo, this PR follows the implement of `to_char` in `Phoenix` that uses `DecimalFormat`.\r\n\r\n**Syntax**\r\n`TO_CHAR(

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Move `DESCRIBE TABLE` parsing tests to `DescribeRelationParserSuite`.\r\n2. Put common `DESCRIBE TABLE` tests into one trait `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.DescribeTableSuiteBase`, and put datasource specific tests to the `v1.DescribeTableSuite` and `v2.DescribeTableSuite`.\r\n\r\nThe changes follow the approach of #30287.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. The unification will allow to run common `DESCRIBE TABLE` tests for both DSv1/Hive DSv1 and DSv2\r\n2. We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove `IS_LITTLE_ENDIAN` field in `UTF8String`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter SPARK-36992 and SPARK-37037, the usage of `IS_LITTLE_ENDIAN` has been moved to `ByteArray`. The original `IS_LITTLE_ENDIAN` in `UTF8String` is unused.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, just a code cleanup\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR provides a vectorized implementation of the DELTA_BYTE_ARRAY encoding of Parquet V2. The PR also implements the DELTA_LENGTH_BYTE_ARRAY encoding which is needed by the former.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current support for Parquet V2 in the vectorized reader uses a non-vectorized version of the above encoding and needs to be vectorized.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nReproduces all the tests for the encodings from the Parquet implementation. Also adds more cases to the Parquet Encoding test suite.","created_at":"2022-01-20T18:50:42Z","updated_at":"2022-03-31T20:22:40Z","closed_at":"2022-03-31T20:07:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4e2d7e583958db343194bc18fd8082f0f3a3f217","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35262/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35262/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35262/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1d150224df1c09304a7fe5a5afca2fdf493798b7","head":{"label":"parthchandra:SPARK-36879-PR3","ref":"SPARK-36879-PR3","sha":"1d150224df1c09304a7fe5a5afca2fdf493798b7","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187921479,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc5MjE0Nzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"parthchandra/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new interface on streaming data source `AcceptsLatestSeenOffset`, which notifies Spark to provide latest seen offset to the sources implementing the interface at every restart of the query. Spark will provide the latest seen offset before fetching the offset or data.\r\n\r\nWorth noting that the interface only support DSv2 streaming sources; the usage of DSv1 streaming source is limited to internal and it has different method call flow, so we would like to focus on DSv2. Spark will throw error if the DSv1 streaming source implements the interface.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis could be useful for the source if source needs to prepare based on the latest seen offset before fetching anything. More specifically, we found this very useful and handy for the data source which needs to track the offset by itself, since the external storage does not provide the offset for the latest available data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the change is limited to the data source developers.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.","created_at":"2022-01-20T12:43:31Z","updated_at":"2022-02-11T07:46:10Z","closed_at":"2022-02-11T07:06:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5bbe9159467cbd64036bec98b90ba232a9064a88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

Why are the changes needed?\r\nBased on [34291](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34291), we can support limit push down to parquet datasource v2 reader, which can stop scanning parquet early, and reduce network and disk IO.\r\nCurrently, only vectorized reader is supported in this pr.
