Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a correctness issue when reading a CSV or a JSON file with dates in \"yyyyMMdd\" format: \r\n```\r\nname,mydate\r\n1,2020011\r\n2,20201203\r\n```\r\nor \r\n```\r\n{\"date\": \"2020011\"}\r\n{\"date\": \"20201203\"} \r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32959, reading this CSV file would return:\r\n```\r\n+----+--------------+\r\n|name|mydate        |\r\n+----+--------------+\r\n|1   |null          |\r\n|2   |2020-12-03    |\r\n+----+--------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, after the patch, the invalid date is parsed because of the much more lenient parsing in `DateTimeUtils.stringToDate`, the method treats `2020011` as a full year:\r\n```\r\n+----+--------------+\r\n|name|mydate        |\r\n+----+--------------+\r\n|1   |+2020011-01-01|\r\n|2   |2020-12-03    |\r\n+----+--------------+\r\n``` \r\nSimilar result would be observed in JSON.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to address correctness issue by introducing a new configuration option `enableDateTimeParsingFallback` which allows to enable/disable the backward compatible parsing. \r\n\r\nCurrently, by default we will fall back to the backward compatible behavior only if parser policy is legacy and no custom pattern was set (this is defined in `UnivocityParser` and `JacksonParser` for csv and json respectively).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixes a correctness issue in Spark 3.4.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid correctness issues when reading CSV or JSON files with a custom pattern, a new configuration option `enableDateTimeParsingFallback` has been added to control whether or not the code would fall back to the backward compatible behavior of parsing dates and timestamps in CSV and JSON data sources.\r\n- If the config is enabled and the date cannot be parsed, we will fall back to `DateTimeUtils.stringToDate`.\r\n- If the config is enabled and the timestamp cannot be parsed, `DateTimeUtils.stringToTimestamp` will be used.\r\n- Otherwise, depending on the parser policy and a custom pattern, the value will be parsed as null.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added unit tests for CSV and JSON to verify the fix and the config option.","created_at":"2022-07-11T01:22:12Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T08:46:33Z","closed_at":"2022-07-27T08:46:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ef7028e5979206f2587179fe958db5ec78f8af8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/739e7dbc9568e4422384480aeb78e4361b797824","head":{"label":"sadikovi:fix-csv-date-inference","ref":"fix-csv-date-inference","sha":"739e7dbc9568e4422384480aeb78e4361b797824","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

note](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases)\r\n\r\n[CVE-2022-2047](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2047)\r\n\r\nInfo from Github dependabot\r\n\r\n### Invalid URI parsing may produce invalid HttpURI.authority\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nURI use within Jetty's `HttpURI` class can parse invalid URIs such as `http://localhost;/path` as having an authority with a host of `localhost;`.\r\n\r\nA URIs of the type `http://localhost;/path` should be interpreted to be either invalid or as `localhost;` to be the userinfo and no host.\r\nHowever, `HttpURI.host` returns `localhost;` which is definitely wrong.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nThis can lead to errors with Jetty's `HttpClient`, and Jetty's `ProxyServlet` / `AsyncProxyServlet` / `AsyncMiddleManServlet` wrongly interpreting an authority with no host as one with a host.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nPatched in PR https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/8146 for Jetty version 9.4.47.\r\nPatched in PR

The location is blockManagerId. This blockManagerId points to ESS port if ESS is enabled for native shuffle blocks. But in case of offloaded blocks, the blockManagerId points to BlockTransferService port. On a executor which has both native and migrated blocks, it will have 2 blockManagerId one pointing to ESS port and another to BlockTransferService port. This scenario leads to getting duplicate executorIds while trying to get Host-local blocks. In this PR, we are updating migrating shuffle block location to point to ESS port if ESS is enabled. Thus making all blocks being served by ESS irrespective of native or, migrated shuffle blocks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make `regr_slope` and `regr_intercept` ANSI-safe by checking zero to avoid divide-by-zero exceptions when ANSI mode is on.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make both expressions working regardless of ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, both functions are not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n`JDBCV2Suite` already covers it when ASNI mode is on. This was found by a broken test case, see also

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Pull out the pattern of `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec` to `ExtractTopK`\r\n- Add a new rule `PushLocalTopKThroughOuterJoin` which matches the  `ExtractTopK` pattern\r\n- Add a new config `spark.sql.optimizer.pushDownLocalTopKLimitThreshold` to decide how big limit we allow push local topK. This is in case regression if the limit number is bigger than the acutally row count.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSupports push down local limit and local sort from TopK through other join:\r\n  - for a left outer join, the references of ordering of TopK come from the left side and\r\n  the limits of TopK is smaller than left side \r\n  - for a right outer join, the references of ordering of TopK come from the right side and\r\n  the limits of TopK is smaller than right side \r\n\r\nIf multi-join satisfy the rule, we should only push local topK to the bottom join.\r\n\r\nAn example for simple left outer join:\r\n```scala\r\nLimit global + local\r\n  Sort global\r\n    Join Left_Outer\r\n       x\r\n       y\r\n\r\n=>\r\n\r\nLimit global + local\r\n  Sort global\r\n    Join Left_Outer\r\n       Limit local\r\n         Sort local\r\n           x\r\n       y\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompared with shuffle + join, local sort should be faster\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only improve performance\r\n\r\n```\r\nval row = 10 * 1000\r\nval df1 = spark.range(0, row, 1, 2).selectExpr(\"id % 3 as c1\", \"id % 7 as cx\")\r\nval df2 = spark.range(0, row, 1, 2).selectExpr(\"id % 3 as c2\")\r\n\r\ndf1.join(df2.hint(\"shuffle_hash\"), col(\"c1\") === col(\"c2\"), \"left_outer\")\r\n              .orderBy(col(\"cx\"))\r\n              .limit(100)\r\n              .noop()\r\n```\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_332-b09 on Linux 5.13.0-1031-azure\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8370C CPU @ 2.80GHz\r\nPush local topK through outer join:               Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPush local topK through outer join for bhj - off           3694           3717          22          0.0      369361.5       1.0X\r\nPush local topK through outer join for shj - off           3761           3767          11          0.0      376057.4       1.0X\r\nPush local topK through outer join for smj - off           3469           3478          10          0.0      346945.6       1.1X\r\nPush local topK through outer join for bhj - on              97            109          10          0.1        9745.2      37.9X\r\nPush local topK through outer join for shj - on             162            176          17          0.1       16153.5      22.9X\r\nPush local topK through outer join for smj - on             160            163           3          0.1       15974.6      23.1X\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

In this example `BucketedRandomProjectionLSH` fit with `df` and `approxSimilarityJoin` measures the distance between `df` and `df1`, that `df1` can be `df` too. what happend if we use `df2` (other

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36773 translate linear regression aggregate functions for pushdown.\r\nAlthough `REGR_AVGX` and `REGR_AVGY` are replaced to `AVG` in runtime, we can pushdown `AVG` to achieve the same result that push down `REGR_AVGX` and `REGR_AVGY`.\r\n\r\nTake `RegrAvgX` as an example, `RegrAvgX` replaced with `Average(If(And(IsNotNull(left), IsNotNull(right)), right, Literal.create(null, right.dataType)))` in runtime and then the latter will be optimized as `Average(CaseWhen(Seq[(And(IsNotNull(left), IsNotNull(right)), right)], Some(Literal.create(null, right.dataType))))`\r\n\r\nWe can see `Literal.create(null, right.dataType)` here, `visitLiteral` of `JDBCSQLBuilder` cannot processing the null literal in the correct way. So we need to fix the issue too.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLet Aggregate pushdown supports `REGR_AVGX` and `REGR_AVGY`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test cases.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-08T04:08:39Z","updated_at":"2022-07-13T07:52:06Z","closed_at":"2022-07-13T07:11:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c493cd291618be818fb5c8ad81eae570ac1256d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4dc872103b0a99b24cff16aec42217c2f12d863f","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-39385_followup","ref":"SPARK-39385_followup","sha":"4dc872103b0a99b24cff16aec42217c2f12d863f","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd suggestion of using try_element_at for INVALID_ARRAY_INDEX error.\r\nBefore change:\r\n```\r\n[INVALID_ARRAY_INDEX] The index 0 is out of bounds. The array has 2 elements. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter change:\r\n```\r\n[INVALID_ARRAY_INDEX] The index 0 is out of bounds. The array has 2 elements. Use `try_element_at` and increase the array index by 1(the starting array index is 1 for `try_element_at`) to tolerate accessing element at invalid index and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo provide actionable suggestion in the error message. Also, after changes, it is consistent with the error `INVALID_ARRAY_INDEX_IN_ELEMENT_AT` and `MAP_KEY_DOES_NOT_EXIST`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes but trivial, changes in the error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-07-08T03:27:37Z","updated_at":"2022-07-08T06:03:08Z","closed_at":"2022-07-08T06:03:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"056eccd78367a0b31d09d33a2e67426976a53cb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37125/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37125/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37125/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11c5e10b859e7c8fb67ad0714e760d289c957d2c","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:suggestionOnArrayOutOfBound","ref":"suggestionOnArrayOutOfBound","sha":"11c5e10b859e7c8fb67ad0714e760d289c957d2c","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec`'s `executeCollect` use `doExecute()`'s result.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the result of `executeCollect` and `doExecute` of `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec` the same. For example:\r\n```scala\r\nimport testImplicits._\r\n\r\nSeq((1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\n  .orderBy(\"a\")\r\n  .selectExpr(\"b\")\r\n  .limit(6)\r\n  .show()/.collect().foreach(println)\r\n```\r\n`.show()` will use `doExecute` and the result is:\r\n```\r\n+---+\r\n|  b|\r\n+---+\r\n|  1|\r\n|  2|\r\n|  3|\r\n|  4|\r\n|  5|\r\n|  6|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n`.collect().foreach(println)` will use `executeCollect` and the result is:\r\n```\r\n[2]\r\n[1]\r\n[3]\r\n[4]\r\n[7]\r\n[6]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark have a lot of built-in aggregate functions.\r\nBut the SQL Reference cannot find these aggregate functions directly and cannot describe the special syntax for PERCENTILE_CONT and PERCENTILE_DISC.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdd SQL reference for aggregate functions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\nUsers can find these aggregate functions directly and the special syntax for PERCENTILE_CONT and PERCENTILE_DISC.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the part 'Data Retrieval

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe change of this pr is add `vector.setIsConstant()` when missing column with defaultValue and `vector.appendObjects(capacity, defaultValue).isPresent()` is true during `ParquetColumnVector` initialization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is just a minor improvement, for the missing column with default value, setting isConstant to true can will prevent the `reset()` method from restoring the internal state of `WritableColumnVector`. `OrcColumnarBatchReader` has done similar things to missing column.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bb4c4778713c7ba1ee92d0bb0763d7d3ce54374f/sql/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/orc/OrcColumnarBatchReader.java#L178-L191\r\n\r\nWithout this change, there will be no bug, because missing column will only be initialized once and the corresponding columnReader is null,  the reset() method will only reset `.WritableColumnVector#elementsAppended` to 0, but this will not affect anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch aims to reduce the memory overhead of `TransportCipher$EncryptedMessage`. In the current code, the `EncryptedMessage` constructor eagerly initializes a `ByteArrayWritableChannel byteRawChannel` (which consumes ~32kb of memory). If there are many `EncryptedMessage` instances on the heap (e.g. because there is a long queue of outgoing messages on a channel) then this overhead adds up and can cause OOMs or GC problems.\r\n\r\nSPARK-24801 / #21811 fixed a similar issue in `SaslEncryption`. There, the fix was to lazily initialize the buffer: the buffer isn't actually accessed before `transferTo()` is called (and is only used there), so lazily initializing it there reduces memory requirements for queued outgoing messages.\r\n\r\nIn principle we could apply a similar lazy initialization fix here. In this PR, however, I have taken a different approach: I construct a single shared `ByteArrayWritableChannel byteRawChannel` in `TransportChannel$EncryptionHandler` and pass that shared instance to the `EncryptedMessage` constructor. I believe that this is safe because we are already doing this for the `byteEncChannel` channel buffer. That shared `byteEncChannel` gets `reset()` when `EncryptedMessage.deallocate()` is called. If we assume that existing sharing is correct then I think it's okay to apply similar sharing of the `byteRawChannel` buffer because its scope of use and lifecycle is similar.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove performance and reduce a source of OOMs when encryption is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n**Correctness**: Existing unit tests.\r\n\r\n**PerformanceI**: observed memory usage and performance improvements by running an artificial workload that significantly stresses the shuffle sending path. On a two-host Spark Standalone cluster where each host had an external shuffle service (with 1gb heap) and a 64-core executor, I ran the following code:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval numMapTasks = 25000\r\nval numReduceTasks = 256\r\nval random = new java.util.Random()\r\nval inputData = spark.range(1, numMapTasks * numReduceTasks, 1, numMapTasks).map { x =>\r\n  val bytes = new Array[Byte](10 * 1024)\r\n  random.nextBytes(bytes)\r\n  bytes\r\n}\r\ninputData.repartition(numReduceTasks).write.mode(\"overwrite\").format(\"noop\").save()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch, this job reliably failed because the Worker (where the shuffle service runs) would fill its heap and go into long GC pauses, eventually causing it to become disassociated from the Master. After this patch's changes, this job smoothly runs to completion.","created_at":"2022-07-07T01:32:22Z","updated_at":"2022-07-10T20:46:24Z","closed_at":"2022-07-10T20:46:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e9a60b59e5736b8dabcac4ea9d92a5a39a58f0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37110/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37110/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37110/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1afb0f5dd43cab97a60335aa3be19e940632320","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:TransportCipher-memory-usage-improvements","ref":"TransportCipher-memory-usage-improvements","sha":"d1afb0f5dd43cab97a60335aa3be19e940632320","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Josh

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36953\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a check for invalid plans in AQE replanning process. The check will throw exceptions when it detects an invalid plan, causing AQE to void the current replanning result and keep using the latest valid plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAQE logical optimization rules can lead to invalid physical plans and cause runtime exceptions as certain physical plan nodes are not compatible with others. E.g., `BroadcastExchangeExec` can only work as a direct child of broadcast join nodes, but it could appear under other incompatible physical plan nodes because of empty relation propagation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

This PR updates the requirement of `lineSep` accepting 1 or 2 characters in `CSVOptions`.\r\n\r\nDue to the limitation of supporting multi-chars `lineSep` within quotes, I propose to leave this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update two-parameter `listColumns/getTable/getFunction/tableExists/functionExists` function's doc to mention the limitation. To use 3 layer namespace, the users can use single parameter functions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe can support the existing users without any overhead and advertise new 3 layer namespace API at the same time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a doc change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark will set maxRows at runtime:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bb6f65acca2918a0ceb13b612d210f1b46fa1add/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/LogicalQueryStage.scala#L58\r\n\r\nThis PR update `SpecialLimits` to use `TakeOrderedAndProject` if maxRows below the `spark.sql.execution.topKSortMaxRowsThreshold`. For example:\r\n```sql\r\ncreate table t1 using parquet as select id, cast(id as string) as value from range(10);\r\nselect * from (select distinct * from t1) order by id;\r\n```\r\nThe query plan:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (14)\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   TakeOrderedAndProject (8)\r\n   +- * HashAggregate (7)\r\n      +- AQEShuffleRead (6)\r\n         +- ShuffleQueryStage (5), Statistics(sizeInBytes=320.0 B, rowCount=10)\r\n            +- Exchange (4)\r\n               +- * HashAggregate (3)\r\n                  +- * ColumnarToRow (2)\r\n                     +- Scan parquet spark_catalog.default.t1 (1)\r\n+- == Initial Plan ==\r\n   Sort (13)\r\n   +- Exchange (12)\r\n      +- HashAggregate (11)\r\n         +- Exchange (10)\r\n            +- HashAggregate (9)\r\n               +- Scan parquet spark_catalog.default.t1 (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance by reducing shuffle.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark test.\r\nBenchmark test code:\r\n```scala\r\nimport

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch have two improvment:\r\n- Add `cache-from`: this will help to speed up cache build and ensure the image will NOT do full refresh if `REFRESH_DATE` is not changed by intention.\r\n- Add `FULL_REFRESH_DATE` in dockerfile: this will help force to do a full refresh.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this PR, if you change the dockerfile, the cache image will do a **complete refreshed** when dockerfile with any changes. This cause the different behavoir between ci tmp image (cache based refresh, in pyspark/sparkr/lint job) and infra cache (full refresh, in build infra cache job).\r\nFinally, if a PR refresh dockerfile, you might see pyspark/sparkr/lint CI is successful, but next pyspark/sparkr/lint CI failure after cache is refreshed (because deps may be changed when image do full refreshed).\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, if you change the dockerfile, the cache image job will do a cache based refreshed (use previous cache as much as possible, and refreshed the left layers when cache mismatch) to keep same behavior of pyspark/sparkr/lint job result.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is similar to **static image** in some level, you can refresh the `FULL_REFRESH_DATE` to force refresh cache completely, the advantage is you can see the pyspark/sparkr/lint ci results in GA when you do full refresh.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe following warnings are displayed when \r\n\r\n`build/sbt \"core/test:runMain org.apache.spark.MapStatusesSerDeserBenchmark\"`\r\n\r\nis executed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[warn] sbt 0.13 shell syntax is deprecated; use slash syntax instead: core / Test / runMain \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the recommended command in the scala doc is deprecated, to this pr do the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Update all `build/sbt \"${projectName}/test:runMain <this class>\"` to `build/sbt \"avro/Test/runMain <this class>\"` in scala doc\r\n- Change to use `build/sbt \"sql/Test/runMain org.apache.spark.sql.GenTPCDSData ...` to generate TPC-DS  table data in `benchmark.yml` and `build_and_test.yml`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUse the recommended sbt syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass Github Actions\r\n- Manual test：\r\n\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new expression `RegExpSubStr` as a runtime replaceable expression of `NullIf` and `RegExpExtract`. And bind the expression to the function name `REGEXP_SUBSTR`. The `REGEXP_SUBSTR` function returns the substring that matches a regular expression within a string. It takes two parameters:\r\n1. An expression that specifies the string in which the search is to take place.\r\n2. An expression that specifies the regular expression string that is the pattern for the search.\r\n\r\nIf the regular expression is not found, the result is **null** (this behaviour is similar to other DBMSs). When any of the input parameters are NULL, the function returns NULL too.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE log (logs string);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO log (logs) VALUES\r\n         > ('127.0.0.1 - - [10/Jan/2022:16:55:36 -0800] \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" 200 2217'),\r\n         > ('192.168.1.99 - - [14/Feb/2022:10:27:10 -0800] \"GET /cgi-bin/try/ HTTP/1.0\" 200 3396');\r\nspark-sql> SELECT REGEXP_SUBSTR (logs,'\\\\b\\\\d{1,3}\\.\\\\d{1,3}\\.\\\\d{1,3}\\.\\\\d{1,3}\\\\b') AS IP, REGEXP_SUBSTR (logs,'([\\\\w:\\/]+\\\\s[+\\-]\\\\d{4})') AS DATE FROM log;\r\n127.0.0.1\t10/Jan/2022:16:55:36 -0800\r\n192.168.1.99\t14/Feb/2022:10:27:10 -0800\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make the migration process from other systems to Spark SQL easier, and achieve feature parity to such systems. For example, the systems below support the `REGEXP_SUBSTR` function, see:\r\n- Oracle: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B12037_01/server.101/b10759/functions116.htm\r\n- DB2: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=functions-regexp-substr\r\n- Snowflake: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/regexp_substr.html\r\n- BigQuery: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#regexp_substr\r\n- Redshift: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/REGEXP_SUBSTR.html\r\n- MariaDB: https://mariadb.com/kb/en/regexp_substr/\r\n- Exasol DB: https://docs.exasol.com/db/latest/sql_references/functions/alphabeticallistfunctions/regexp_substr.htm\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z regexp-functions.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *ExpressionsSchemaSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`FileFormatWriter.write` is used by all V1 write commands including data source and hive tables. Depending on dynamic partitions, bucketed, and sort columns in the V1 write command, `FileFormatWriter` can add a physical sort on top of the query plan which is not visible from plan directly.\r\n\r\nThis PR (based on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34568) intends to pull out the physical sort added by `FileFormatWriter` into logical planning. It adds a new logical rule `V1Writes` to add logical Sort operators based on the required ordering of a V1 write command. This behavior can be controlled by the new config **spark.sql.optimizer.plannedWrite.enabled** (default: true). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove observability of V1 write, and unify the logic of V1 and V2 write commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen trying to reuse Exchange of a subquery in main plan, if the Exchange inside subquery materialize first then main ASPE node won't have that stage info (in [stageToReplace](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.scala#L243)) to replace in current logical plan. This will cause AQE to produce new candidate physical plan without reusing the exchange present inside subquery. And depending on how complex the inner plan is (no. of exchanges) AQE could choose plan without ReusedExchange. \r\n\r\nWe have seen this with multiple queries with our private build. This can happen in DPP also.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`GenTPCDSData` uses the schema defined in `TPCDSSchema` that contains `char(N)`. When `GenTPCDSData` generates parquet files, that pads spaces for strings whose lengths are `< N`.\r\n\r\nWhen `TPCDSQueryBenchmark` reads data from parquet generated by `GenTPCDSData`, it uses schema from the parquet file and keeps the paddings. Due to the extra spaces, string filter queries of TPC-DS fail to match. For example, `q13` query results are all nulls and returns too fast because string filter does not meet any rows.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to pass the schema definition to the table creation before reading in order to fix the issue. This is similar to what the Spark TPC-DS unit tests do. In particular, this PR uses `createTable(tableName, source, schema, options)` interface.\r\n\r\nHistory related to the `char` issue https://lists.apache.org/thread/rg7pgwyto3616hb15q78n0sykls9j7rn\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, `TPCDSQueryBenchmark` is benchmarking with wrong query results and that is showing inaccurate performance results. Therefore, the `Per Row(ns)` column of `TPCDSQueryBenchmark-results.txt` is `Infinity`. With this PR, the column now shows real numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested on Github

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSkip local sort in `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec` if child output ordering satisfies the required.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTakeOrderedAndProjectExec should respect child output ordering to avoid unnecessary sort.\r\nFor example:  TakeOrderedAndProjectExec on the top of SortMergeJoin.\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c2 ORDER BY t1.c1 LIMIT 100;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, only improve performance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdd benchmark test:\r\n```sql\r\nval row = 10 * 1000\r\nval df1 = spark.range(0, row, 1, 2).selectExpr(\"id % 3 as c1\")\r\nval df2 = spark.range(0, row, 1, 2).selectExpr(\"id % 3 as c2\")\r\ndf1.join(df2, col(\"c1\") === col(\"c2\"))\r\n          .orderBy(col(\"c1\"))\r\n          .limit(100)\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a test case broken by https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4b9343593eca780ca30ffda45244a71413577884 which was reverted in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/161c596cafea9c235b5c918d8999c085401d73a9.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo prevent a regression in the future. This was a regression in Apache Spark 3.3 that used to work in Apache Spark 3.2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it makes `DataFrame.exceptAll` followed by `count` working.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe unit test was

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe should propagate the row count stats in SizeInBytesOnlyStatsPlanVisitor if available. Row counts are propagated from connectors to spark in case of v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis can improve stats estimation for v2 tables, since row count is used at places to estimate sizeInBytes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch add GITHUB_WORKSPACE to git trust safe.directory for container based job.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 container based job in Spark Infra:\r\n- sparkr\r\n- lint\r\n- pyspark\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen upgrade `git >= 2.35.2` (such as latest dev docker image in my case), fix a [CVE-2022-24765](https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/#cve-2022-24765) , and it has been backported [latest ubuntu git](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/760#issuecomment-1099355820)\r\n\r\nThe `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` is belong to action user (in host), but the container user is `root` (in container) (root is required in our spark job), so cause the error like:\r\n```\r\nfatal: unsafe repository ('/__w/spark/spark' is owned by someone else)\r\nTo add an exception for this directory, call:\r\n    git config --global --add safe.directory /__w/spark/spark\r\nfatal: unsafe repository ('/__w/spark/spark' is owned by someone else)\r\nTo add an exception for this directory, call:\r\n    git config --global --add safe.directory /__w/spark/spark\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution is from `action/checkout` https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/760 , just add `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` to git trust safe.directory to make container user can checkout successfully.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI passed.\r\nCI passed with latest ubuntu hosted runner, here is a simple e2e test for pyspark job https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37005\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-05T03:39:40Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T10:01:52Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T11:54:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7316d7425138f651bb8d5ce8cc24f2e1b825760","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37079/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37079/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37079/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3498a2d56d0d0f43d61b6ab5e88297e492cb4038","head":{"label":"Yikun:SPARK-39610","ref":"SPARK-39610","sha":"3498a2d56d0d0f43d61b6ab5e88297e492cb4038","user":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335541670,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU1NDE2NzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"Yikun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fix the wrong aliases in `__array_ufunc__`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen running test with numpy 1.23.0 (current latest), hit a bug: `NotImplementedError: pandas-on-Spark objects currently do not support <ufunc 'divide'>.`\r\n\r\nIn `__array_ufunc__` we first call `maybe_dispatch_ufunc_to_dunder_op` to try dunder methods first, and then we try pyspark API. `maybe_dispatch_ufunc_to_dunder_op` is from pandas code.\r\n\r\npandas fix a bug https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/44822#issuecomment-991166419 https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/44822/commits/206b2496bc6f6aa025cb26cb42f52abeec227741 when upgrade to numpy 1.23.0, we need to also sync this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Current CI passed\r\n- The exsiting UT `test_series_datetime` already cover this, I also test it in my local env with 1.23.0\r\n```shell\r\npip install \"numpy==1.23.0\"\r\npython/run-tests --testnames 'pyspark.pandas.tests.test_series_datetime

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to switch 'spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode' configuration from testing purpose to internal purpose by removing `Utils.isTesting`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it changes the documentation in 'spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode' to say that this is only for internal purpose, and NOT supposed to be set by end users.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe can actually leverage this configuration in other testing beds that mimic production environment to make sure the fallback codegen works in production too.\r\n\r\nAnother point is about benchmarking in the production enviornment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing.","created_at":"2022-07-05T00:13:40Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:20Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T03:47:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ea890876b8a39ec7f8743e3ab8e99ffb4582f84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9117b539490e42654f0534ff05dc9bf7a197aa5d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-39675","ref":"SPARK-39675","sha":"9117b539490e42654f0534ff05dc9bf7a197aa5d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd more checks to`removeProjectBeforeFilter` in `ColumnPruning` and only remove the project if\r\n1. the filter condition contains correlated subquery\r\n2. same attribute exists in both output of child of Project and subquery\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a legitimate self-join query and should not throw exception when de-duplicating attributes in subquery and outer values.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect * from\r\n(\r\nselect v1.a, v1.b, v2.c\r\nfrom v1\r\ninner join v2\r\non v1.a=v2.a) t3\r\nwhere not exists (\r\n  select 1\r\n  from v2\r\n  where t3.a=v2.a and t3.b=v2.b and t3.c=v2.c\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's what happens with the current code. The above query is analyzed into following `LogicalPlan` before `ColumnPruning`.\r\n```\r\nProject [a#250, b#251, c#268]\r\n+- Filter NOT exists#272 [(a#250 = a#266) && (b#251 = b#267) && (c#268 = c#268#277)]\r\n   :  +- Project [1 AS 1#273, _1#259 AS a#266, _2#260 AS b#267, _3#261 AS c#268#277]\r\n   :     +- LocalRelation [_1#259, _2#260, _3#261]\r\n   +- Project [a#250, b#251, c#268]\r\n      +- Join Inner, (a#250 = a#266)\r\n         :- Project [a#250, b#251]\r\n         :  +- Project [_1#243 AS a#250, _2#244 AS b#251]\r\n         :     +- LocalRelation [_1#243, _2#244, _3#245]\r\n         +- Project [a#266, c#268]\r\n            +- Project [_1#259 AS a#266, _3#261 AS c#268]\r\n               +- LocalRelation [_1#259, _2#260, _3#261]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in `ColumnPruning`, the Project before Filter (between Filter and Join) is removed. This changes the `outputSet` of the child of Filter among which the same attribute also exists in the subquery. Later, when `RewritePredicateSubquery` de-duplicates conflicting attributes, it would complain `Found conflicting attributes a#266 in the condition joining outer plan`. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `ANALYZE TABLE tbl COMPUTE STATISTICS;` as a workaround when there is not enough memory to build and broadcast the table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current workaround has the following disadvantages:\r\n1. Setting `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` to -1 will disable all broadcast joins.\r\n2. We don't know the specific value of `spark.driver.memory` should be set.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing:\r\n```\r\nNot enough memory to build and broadcast the table to all worker nodes. As a workaround, you can either disable broadcast by setting spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold to -1 or increase the spark driver memory by setting spark.driver.memory to a higher value or analyze these tables through: ANALYZE TABLE `tpds5t`.`item` COMPUTE STATISTICS;.\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-07-04T03:30:56Z","updated_at":"2022-07-11T14:16:05Z","closed_at":"2022-07-11T14:15:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f91a302ae1a5bfeb036b2f13771866a5f5e61953","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7e429dc68123439266936f85835e4de59b418121","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-39667","ref":"SPARK-39667","sha":"7e429dc68123439266936f85835e4de59b418121","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467759455,"node_id":"R_kgDOG-FxXw","name":"spark","full_name":"wangyum/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is sort of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/88d8de9260edf6e9d5449ff7ef6e35d16051fc9f to respect interpreted projections in `ExpressionEncoder`. Similar fix was made before in deserialization side at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/26128484228089c74517cd15cef0bb4166a4186f, and this PR completes it in serialization side too.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a symmetry with https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/26128484228089c74517cd15cef0bb4166a4186f. We should make the configurations respected consistently.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, by default.\r\nYes, when users set `spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode` to other values. The operations such as DSv1, DSv2, or object conversions such as `MapObjects` will respect the value.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test cases at `RowEncoderSuite extends CodegenInterpretedPlanTest` and `ExpressionEncoderSuite extends CodegenInterpretedPlanTest` should cover this.","created_at":"2022-07-04T03:01:42Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:21Z","closed_at":"2022-07-04T10:46:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"af085f40faaf1553981f34ed02e93f563d00d11c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8a234cd4877502a0a2a05f69680e0baa4ae1f931","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-39666","ref":"SPARK-39666","sha":"8a234cd4877502a0a2a05f69680e0baa4ae1f931","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

python packages to README and requirements.txt to fix issues with building python documentation\r\n\r\nThere are currently two ways to install python packages for building python documentation:\r\n1.

running the requirements.txt file, from $SPARK_HOME\r\n```sh\r\npip install -r dev/requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Adding 'markupsafe==2.0.1' to both /docs/README.md and /dev/requirements.txt\r\n2. Syncing both files to contain the same packages \r\n3. Adding pyarrow to /docs/README.md \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. markupsafe==2.1.1 would run into errors when building python documentation (using 'make html')\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89562186/177061721-4caca44e-1b39-4458-906e-9669c426fc68.png)\r\n[Similar stack overflow issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72191560/importerror-cannot-import-name-soft-unicode-from-markupsafe)\r\nDowngrading to markupsafe==2.0.1 fixes missing 'soft_unicode' module issues\r\n2. Adding missing packages from requirements.txt (Under Documentation-Python) to README.md, this fixes some additional bugs when trying to build docs from the README command.\r\n3. Finally, running the README command runs into one last error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89562186/177062155-0e6432c1-16be-4edd-8430-737376828a6a.png)\r\nThis is because

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[SPARK-39452](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39452) Extend EdgePartition1D with Destination based Strategy\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, the [EdgePartition1D](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/graphx/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/graphx/PartitionStrategy.scala#L101)  use only the source vertex ID.\r\n\r\nIf doing topological like algorithm on graph, directly partition based on destination vertex ID would improve the performance significantly. The proposal here is adding new case objects EdgePartition1DDst and EdgePartition1DSrc explicitly for EdgePartition1D.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIntroduce new partition strategy `EdgePartition1DDst` and update `EdgePartition1D` to `EdgePartition1DSrc`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTest locally. `mvn test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently the executors register with the ESS after the `BlockManager` registration with the `BlockManagerMaster`.  This order creates a problem with the push-based shuffle. A registered BlockManager node is picked up by the driver as a merger but the shuffle service on that node is not yet ready to merge the data which causes block pushes to fail until the local executor registers with it. This fix is to reverse the order, that is, register with the ESS before registering the `BlockManager`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThey are needed to fix the issue which causes block pushes to fail. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a UT.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-01T18:54:41Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T23:58:11Z","closed_at":"2022-07-12T05:21:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da1392deddbe7dd17c9a53a28f703e534624a7e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37052/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37052/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37052/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1c7d3b6522147234402f3e9d996ad398fb20ccaa","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-39647","ref":"SPARK-39647","sha":"1c7d3b6522147234402f3e9d996ad398fb20ccaa","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`try_to_char` is exactly the same as `to_char` now, because `to_char` only fails if the format string is invalid, which `try_to_char` will fai as well. This PR removes `try_to_char`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.
