What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims ignore `from_protobuf messageClassName` and `from_protobuf messageClassName options` in `PlanGenerationTestSuite` and remove the related golden files, after this change `from_protobuf_messageClassName` and `from_protobuf_messageClassName_options` in `ProtoToParsedPlanTestSuite` be ignored too.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSPARK-43646 | (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42236) makes both Maven and SBT use the shaded `spark-protobuf` module when testing the connect module, this allows `mvn clean install` and `mvn package test` to successfully pass tests. But if `mvn clean test` is executed directly, an error `package org.sparkproject.spark_protobuf.protobuf does not exist` will occur. This is because `mvn clean test` directly uses the classes file of the `spark-protobuf` module for testing, without the 'package', hence it does not `shade` and `relocate` protobuf. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the change of SPARK-43646 breaks the usability of importing Spark as a Maven project into IDEA(https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42236#issuecomment-1700493815). \r\n\r\nSo https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42746 revert the change of [SPARK-43646](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43646). \r\n\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to find a perfect solution to solve this maven test issues now, as in certain scenarios tests would use the `shaded spark-protobuf jar`, like `mvn package test`, while in some other scenarios it will use the `unshaded classes directory`, such as `mvn clean test`. so this pr ignores the relevant tests first and leaves a TODO(SPARK-45030), to re-enable these tests when we find a better solution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass Github Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis reverts commit df63adf734370f5c2d71a348f9d36658718b302c.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs [reported](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42236#issuecomment-1700493815) by @MaxGekk , the solution for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42236 is not perfect, and it breaks the usability of importing Spark as a Maven project into idea. On the other hand, if `mvn clean test` is executed, test failures will also occur like\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /tmp/spark-3.5.0/connector/connect/server/target/generated-test-sources/protobuf/java/org/apache/spark/sql/protobuf/protos/TestProto.java:9:46:  error: package org.sparkproject.spark_protobuf.protobuf does not exist\r\n```\r\nTherefore, this pr will revert the change of SPARK-43646, and `from_protobuf messageClassName` and `from_protobuf messageClassName options` in `PlanGenerationTestSuite` will be ignored in a follow-up. \r\n\r\nAt present, it is difficult to make the maven testing of the `spark-protobuf` function in the `connect` module as good as possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-31T07:28:18Z","updated_at":"2023-08-31T11:43:33Z","closed_at":"2023-08-31T11:43:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46f8ca2d3005513984c1f2b5ccc9a580a1c000a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/521919e723fc9185fe0f570ac8a5e8396242687f","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:Revert-SPARK-43646","ref":"Revert-SPARK-43646","sha":"521919e723fc9185fe0f570ac8a5e8396242687f","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAllow block manager memory store iterator to handle thread interrupt and perform task completion gracefully\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently the `putIteratorAsBytes` can remain hung even if thread interrupt is received on task cancellation leading to the task reaper killing the executor JVM eventually. The reason for this is that the interrupt is never processed within the while loop for the unroll block which leads to the task continuing running beyond the reaper timeout.\r\n\r\nAttached the logs here for a particular task/thread:\r\n```\r\n10.1.121.105/app-20230824190614-0000/735/stderr.txt:55427:23/08/29 12:01:51 INFO CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend: Got assigned task

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR captures the dataset APIs used by the user code and the call site in the user code and provides better error messages.\r\n\r\nE.g. consider the following Spark app `SimpleApp.scala`:\r\n```scala\r\n   1  import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n   2  import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n   3\r\n   4  object SimpleApp {\r\n   5    def main(args: Array[String]) {\r\n   6      val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Simple Application\").config(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\", true).getOrCreate()\r\n   7      import spark.implicits._\r\n   8\r\n   9      val c = col(\"a\") / col(\"b\")\r\n  10\r\n  11      Seq((1, 0)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\").select(c).show()\r\n  12\r\n  13      spark.stop()\r\n  14    }\r\n  15  }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAfter this PR the error message contains the error context (which Spark Dataset API is called from where in the user code) in the following form:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== Dataset ==\r\n\"div\" was called from SimpleApp$.main(SimpleApp.scala:9)\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.divideByZeroError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:201)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.DivModLike.eval(arithmetic.scala:672\r\n...\r\n```\r\nwhich is similar to the already provided context in case of SQL queries:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 1) ==\r\na / b\r\n^^^^^\r\n\r\n\tat

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to assign the name `NON_FOLDABLE_ARGUMENT` to the legacy error class `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1100`, and improve the error message format: make it less restrictive.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To don't confuse users by slightly restrictive error message about literals.\r\n2. To assign proper name as a part of activity in SPARK-37935\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Only if user's code depends on error class name and message parameters.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified and affected tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.StringFunctionsSuite\"\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-08-30T11:08:14Z","updated_at":"2023-08-31T19:50:57Z","closed_at":"2023-08-31T19:50:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d27e68e98b97d2920815d65e1da06f282eafe8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42737/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42737/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42737/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8989f09205408fcffd0c2ffbfca01aa14633ba68","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:assign-name-_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1100","ref":"assign-name-_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1100","sha":"8989f09205408fcffd0c2ffbfca01aa14633ba68","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to clean up the files, jars and archives added via Spark Connect sessions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn [SPARK-44348](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44348), we clean up Spark Context's added files but we don't clean up the ones in fileserver.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will avoid slowly growing memory within the file server.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. Also existing tests should not be broken.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-08-30T05:47:26Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:51:44Z","closed_at":"2023-08-31T06:21:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"064767b7aaff9e2c3dffb64bee6f3451714e30c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42731/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42731/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42731/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aff25dea0d9cf7b01ed8a02d8495e09d8935137e","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-45014","ref":"SPARK-45014","sha":"aff25dea0d9cf7b01ed8a02d8495e09d8935137e","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCheckAnalysis should throw inlined plan in AnalysisException\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBefore this change, the plan attached to AnalysisException is analyzed plan but not inlined. However, `CheckAnalysis` inlines and checks the plan, so if an exception is from `CheckAnalysis`, it should attach the inlined version of plan which is more useful to debug than the original analyzed plan, especially when there is CTE in inside the plan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to limit GHA job execution time to up to 5 hours in `build_and_test.yml` in order to avoid idle hung time.\r\nNew limit is applied for all jobs except three jobs (`precondition`, `infra-image`, and `breaking-changes-buf`) which didn't get a hung situation before.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the default value (6 hour) is used.\r\n\r\n- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes\r\n  > The maximum number of minutes to let a job run before GitHub automatically cancels it. Default: 360\r\n\r\nHowever, when the jobs hit the limit, it's already a hung job and the pipeline becomes idle for over 5 hours like the following.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/5999379610/job/16269462910 (IDLE for about 5 hours 3 minutes)\r\n```\r\n2023-08-28T12:44:10.9217219Z Starting test(python3.9):

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to validate checksum of remounted PVC's shuffle data before recovery.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn general, there are many reasons which causes the executor terminations and some of them causes data corruptions on disks. Since Apache Spark has checksum files already, we can take advantage of it in order to improve the robustness by preventing any potential remounted disk issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with newly added test suite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to reduce the CI time for `pyspark-pandas-connect` by splitting the slow tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR basically:\r\n- Split `pyspark-pandas-slow-connect` into two parts.\r\n- Move couple of slow tests into `pyspark-pandas-slow-connect-part2`\r\n- Split the existing tests into several parts, and move into `pyspark-pandas-slow-connect-part2`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`pyspark-pandas-connect` test takes more than 3 hours in Github Actions, so we might need to reduce the execution time. See https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/5989124806/job/16245001034 as an example.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"516\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 6 20 41 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/17f6e21a-3c72-4421-a924-712828171e26\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it's test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually tested, and the actual testing time should be reduced form Github Actions CI when it's done.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAvoid uncaught exception from state store maintenance task thread on error to prevent executor being killed\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith the current change, the uncaught exception handler was being triggered on the executor leading to the executor being killed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * The default uncaught exception handler for Spark daemons. It terminates the whole process for\r\n * any Errors, and also terminates the process for Exceptions when the exitOnException flag is true.\r\n *\r\n * @param exitOnUncaughtException Whether to exit the process on UncaughtException.\r\n */\r\nprivate[spark] class SparkUncaughtExceptionHandler(val exitOnUncaughtException: Boolean = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally we just want to note the exception which will eventually be picked up by the maintenance task thread and force the reset, instead of causing the executor JVM process to be killed. This change fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n[info] Run

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `getPartition` method checks `shouldPartition` every time it is called. However, `shouldPartition` should not be changeable after the `ExternalSorter` is instantiated, so this PR makes the following changes to `getPartition` to avoid always checking `shouldPartition`:\r\n\r\n1. Added `val actualPartitioner`: when `shouldPartition` is true, it uses `partitioner.get`, otherwise it returns `ConstantPartitioner`, where `ConstantPartitioner` is defined as follows:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/df63adf734370f5c2d71a348f9d36658718b302c/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/Partitioner.scala#L156-L162\r\n\r\n2. After step 1, the private method `getPartition` can directly call `actualPartitioner.getPartition`. In order to shorten the call stack, this PR replaces the call to `getPartition` in `ExternalSorter` with a call to `actualPartitioner.getPartition`.\r\n\r\n3. Checked `numPartitions > 1` directly when initializing `val actualPartitioner` and removed `val shouldPartition`, because it is no longer used elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo reduce checks on `shouldPartition` when calling `getPartition`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-08-29T03:35:36Z","updated_at":"2023-08-29T15:53:13Z","closed_at":"2023-08-29T15:30:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02f84404e5455b55cfbea6da6e51e29cab29f652","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42713/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42713/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42713/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a02022d35107e1bdb5d8631082a39d69949f0f73","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:ExternalSorter-partitioner","ref":"ExternalSorter-partitioner","sha":"a02022d35107e1bdb5d8631082a39d69949f0f73","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `ShuffleChecksumUtils.compareChecksums` by reusing the existing test code `ShuffleChecksumTestHelp.compareChecksums` in order to reuse the functionality in the main code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is very useful in the test code. We can take advantage of this verification logic in `core` module.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the existing test codes because this is a kind of refactoring.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a directional message to promote `JIRA_ACCESS_TOKEN` when `JIRA_USERNAME` and `JIRA_PASSWORD` are used.\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR set the minimum JIRA library version to make it sure that `token_auths` features exist in the installed `jira` library.\r\n```\r\n-jira\r\n+jira>=3.5.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-44802, `Token` feature seems to be stable and provides much secure environments to Apache Spark committers by hiding not only `JIRA_PASSWORD`, but also the static `JIRA_USERNAME`.\r\n```\r\nSPARK-44802 Token based ASF JIRA authentication\r\nSPARK-44802 Fix to consider JIRA_ACCESS_TOKEN in precheck conditions\r\nSPARK-44972 Eagerly check if the token is valid to align with the behavior of username/password auth\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo,","created_at":"2023-08-28T16:32:36Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T18:48:31Z","closed_at":"2023-08-28T18:48:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4572e5f39772e40e613ffbf5af6e73ae560d719","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42704/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42704/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42704/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/09fcf009ad3759bac267be202be86002c0090767","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-44989","ref":"SPARK-44989","sha":"09fcf009ad3759bac267be202be86002c0090767","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to invoke the `to_varchar` function instead of `to_char` in `to_varchar` of Scala/Java API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To show correct function name in error messages and in `explain`.\r\n2. To be consistent to other API: PySpark and the previous Spark SQL version 3.5.0.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.StringFunctionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-08-28T14:13:03Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T17:57:37Z","closed_at":"2023-08-28T17:57:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"180064041e709bb7d64f5cec29b6b9ea6f406154","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42703/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42703/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42703/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cc2e27ca0aec5be0ff11f2977a7cf23c8fa05993","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-to_varchar-call","ref":"fix-to_varchar-call","sha":"cc2e27ca0aec5be0ff11f2977a7cf23c8fa05993","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug in createDataFrame with Python Spark Connect client. Now it respects inherited namedtuples as below:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections import namedtuple\r\nMyTuple = namedtuple(\"MyTuple\", [\"zz\", \"b\", \"a\"])\r\n\r\nclass MyInheritedTuple(MyTuple):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([MyInheritedTuple(1, 2, 3), MyInheritedTuple(11, 22, 33)])\r\ndf.collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Row(zz=None, b=None, a=None), Row(zz=None, b=None, a=None)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Row(zz=1, b=2, a=3), Row(zz=11, b=22, a=33)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is already supported without Spark Connect. We should match the behaviour for consistent API support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, as described above. It fixes a bug,\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as described above, and unittests were added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-08-28T02:22:00Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:51:48Z","closed_at":"2023-08-28T06:47:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e11d8eb9edb87cf28b75ee9e74d70e47544b08a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42693/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42693/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42693/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c5838cd7988727595124bacdc4e132ddec36f605","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-44980","ref":"SPARK-44980","sha":"c5838cd7988727595124bacdc4e132ddec36f605","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR changes the serialization for connect `SparkSession`, `Dataset`, and `KeyValueGroupedDataset`. While these were marked as serializable they were not, because they refer to bits and pieces that are not serializable. Even if we were to fix this, then we still have a class clash problem with server side classes that have the same name, but have different structure. the latter can be fixed with serialization proxies, but I am going to hold that until someone actually needs/wants this.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR these classes are serialized as null. This is a somewhat suboptimal solution compared to throwing exceptions on serialization, however this is more compatible compared to the old situation, and makes accidental capture of these classes less of an issue for UDFs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMore compatible with the old situation. Improved UX when working with UDFs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `ClientDatasetSuite`, `KeyValueGroupedDatasetE2ETestSuite`, `SparkSessionSuite`, and `UserDefinedFunctionE2ETestSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-08-26T00:52:28Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T13:05:26Z","closed_at":"2023-08-28T13:05:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c1e74771e1d6150432f214ee16dbc551157ef43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42688/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42688/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42688/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c148e7b6082cbd0f2f9a1eb0dd97d5a18a864aff","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-44974","ref":"SPARK-44974","sha":"c148e7b6082cbd0f2f9a1eb0dd97d5a18a864aff","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for SSL/TLS based communication for Spark RPCs and block transfers - providing an alternative to the existing encryption / authentication implementation documented at https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/security.html#spark-rpc-communication-protocol-between-spark-processes\r\n\r\nThis is based on an existing PR from 2015: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/9416 - with some refactoring and a number of updates to make it work with changes to Spark since.\r\n\r\nI understand this is a large PR, so I've broken this down by a high level summary of changes and a suggested review order:\r\n\r\n* Add a dependency on `netty-tcnative-boringssl-static` which provides support for faster TLS communication\r\n* Add documentation for the new functionality in `docs/security.md` which describe the new flags and configuration.\r\n* Extend `SSLOptions` and `TransportConf` to support the new flags for this feature \r\n* Extend `TransportContext` to optionally add an SSL based handler if configured, and make similar changes in the transport client and server factories\r\n* Add a new API to `ManagedBuffer` to convert objects to a Netty object for SSL encoding (since we can't use zero-copy transfers, we can't use `convertToNetty()` directly)\r\n* Add some helper classes for communication:\r\n  * `EncryptedMessageWithHeader` and `SSLMessageEncoder` are quite similar to the existing variants but just different enough that it was hard to consolidate\r\n  * `SSLFactory` to create the JDK / Netty SSL handlers as appropriate. This handles configuration of the protocols, ciphers, etc\r\n  * `ReloadingX509TrustManager` to support trust store reloading. \r\n* Change `SecurityManager` to disable the existing authentication/encryption mechanisms if this new feature is enabled\r\n* Update `SparkConf` and `CommandUtils` to pass passwords via env variables if needed, to preserve security guarantees (similar to the existing SSL password propagation)\r\n* Update almost all constructor callsites of `SparkTransportConf` to propagate SSL options\r\n* Add tests:\r\n  * Add test keys + certificates in a bunch of places\r\n  * Add an `SSLSampleConfigs` class for sample configurations used in tests\r\n  * Add tests for a bunch of the new classes + features\r\n  * Add new tests for almost all modules that create a `TransportContext` which rerun the same tests but with this new feature enabled (this caught a bunch of bugs). This will ensure features are compatible with SSL going forward\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark currently does not support TLS/SSL for RPC and block transfers. It is helpful to have this as an alternative encryption method for users which may need to use more standard encryption mechanisms instead of one that is more internal to spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this includes new configuration options and updates associated documentation. Besides that, though, all other aspects of Spark should remain unchanged (modulo performance differences).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a bunch of unit tests that pass. \r\n\r\nI also ran some queries locally to ensure they still work.\r\n\r\nI verified traffic was encrypted using TLS using two mechanisms:\r\n\r\n* Enabled trace level logging for Netty and JDK SSL and saw logs confirming TLS handshakes were happening\r\n* I ran wireshark on my machine and snooped on traffic while sending queries shuffling a fixed string. Without any encryption, I could find that string in the network traffic. With this encryption enabled, that string did not show up, and wireshark logs confirmed a TLS handshake was happening.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-08-25T16:57:22Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T03:21:35Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T03:21:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30384d506086d652c45e891955501b02c8b30843","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mridulm","id":1591700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1591700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm","html_url":"https://github.com/mridulm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mridulm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406625202,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI1MjAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MESOS","name":"MESOS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42685/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42685/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42685/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cd6810fb62287bc972279defaaaebf090bb3dfbe","head":{"label":"hasnain-db:spark-tls","ref":"spark-tls","sha":"cd6810fb62287bc972279defaaaebf090bb3dfbe","user":{"login":"hasnain-db","id":122326278,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qNBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db","html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677479521,"node_id":"R_kgDOKGGEYQ","name":"spark","full_name":"hasnain-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hasnain-db","id":122326278,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qNBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db","html_url":"https://github

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMetricSystem picks up new metrics from sources that are added throughout execution. If you do measurements via dynamic proxies you might not want to redeclare all metrics that the proxies will create and you'd prefer them to get populated as they're being produced. Right now all sources are processed only onceat startup and metrics are picked up only if they have been registered statically at compile time. Behaviour I am proposing lets you not have to declare metrics in two places.\r\n\r\nThis had been previously suggested in #18406, #29980,  #31267, #35357, #36889, #38209, #39755 and #41120.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there's no way to access MetricRegistry that MetricsSystem uses to hold its state and as such it's not possible to reprocess a source. MetricsSystem throws if any metric had already been registered previously.\r\n\r\nn.b. the MetricRegistry is added as a constructor argument to make testing easier but could as well be accessed via reflection as a private variable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-25T14:43:21Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T00:19:06Z","closed_at":"2023-12-05T00:19:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a00c85afd8927cc5e2f70a17339875eabafb3c32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984378631,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0Mzc4NjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAM","name":"DSTREAM","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42684/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42684/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42684/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/88bb6693761673c25051da7215684ed6eaf03bb5","head":{"label":"robert3005:rk/lazy-registries","ref":"rk/lazy-registries","sha":"88bb6693761673c25051da7215684ed6eaf03bb5","user":{"login":"robert3005","id":512084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005","html_url":"https://github.com/robert3005","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47656892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzY1Njg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"robert3005/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robert3005","id":512084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005","html_url":"https://github.com/robert3005","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert3005/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robert3005/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add **Java 21 Maven** build to `build_and_test.yml` to `master` branch for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n- `java-11-17` is renamed to `java-other-versions`\r\n- New Java version `21-ea` is added.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNow, we have a daily **Java 21 SBT-based** GitHub Action job with full test coverage.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/5971697224/job/16201162347\r\n\r\nThis will do a **Java 21 Maven** build test in advance to prevent any compilation errors and Maven-specific issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe PR builder has `Java 21`.\r\n\r\n-

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pull request eliminates the unnecessary use of escape for error summary cells.\r\n\r\nPreviously, all the error details and some of the error summaries, such as the Task list on the stage page, did not call escapeHtml4. The rest of the error summaries, such as Job list, Stage list, Query list, etc., will do an extra escapeHtml4 that is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUI improvement\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUI changes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### new tests\r\n#### Local test\r\n\r\n#####

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR improves JSON parsing when `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled: \r\n- Fixes the issue when using nested arrays `ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.GenericArrayData cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow`\r\n- Improves parsing of the nested struct fields, e.g. `{\"a1\": \"AAA\", \"a2\": [{\"f1\": \"\", \"f2\": \"\"}], \"a3\": \"id1\", \"a4\": \"XXX\"}` used to be parsed as `|AAA|NULL    |NULL|NULL|` and now is parsed as `|AAA|[{NULL, }]|id1|XXX|`.\r\n- Improves performance of nested JSON parsing. The initial implementation would throw too many exceptions when multiple nested fields failed to parse. When the config is disabled, it is not a problem because the entire record is marked as NULL.\r\n\r\nThe internal benchmarks show the performance improvement from slowdown of over 160% to an improvement of 7-8% compared to the master branch when the flag is enabled. I will create a follow-up ticket to add a benchmark for this regression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes some corner cases in JSON parsing and improves performance when `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added tests to verify nested structs, maps, and arrays can be parsed without affecting the subsequent fields in the JSON. I also updated the existing tests when `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled because we parse more data now.\r\n\r\nI added a benchmark to check performance.\r\n\r\nBefore the change

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new script named `errors_doc_gen.py` that automatically generates an RST documentation file containing the error classes defined in `pyspark.errors.error_classes`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWith the increasing number of error classes in PySpark, it becomes imperative to have a centralized documentation that provides an overview of these errors for both developers and users. This automated script ensures that the documentation is always up-to-date with the error classes defined in the source code, reducing the manual effort required to update the documentation each time a new error class is introduced or an existing one is modified.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, this script is primarily for internal use by developers to generate documentation. End-users will benefit from the updated documentation that this script produces, but they will not directly interact with the script itself.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe script was executed locally, and the generated RST file was verified for accuracy and completeness. Furthermore, the generated RST was rendered using Sphinx to ensure it produces the expected visual output.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1395\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-24 at 10 19 52 PM\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to fix bug for `Switch languages consistently across docs for all code snippets`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen a user chooses a different language for a code snippet, all code snippets on that page should switch to the chosen language. This was the behavior for, for example, Spark 2.0 doc: https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.0/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html\r\nBut it was broken for later docs, for example the Spark 3.4.1 doc: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html\r\nWe should fix this behavior change and possibly add test cases to prevent future regressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test:\r\n```\r\ncd docs\r\nSKIP_API=1 bundle exec jekyll serve --watch\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-08-24T11:46:47Z","updated_at":"2023-08-25T01:20:32Z","closed_at":"2023-08-25T00:48:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7bdc86ef618d52f35ef0c9b7cac04a9981843772","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42657/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42657/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42657/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/640c47e99b66aa924b71cfc8bb46403d43dbd1e6","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-44820","ref":"SPARK-44820","sha":"640c47e99b66aa924b71cfc8bb46403d43dbd1e6","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to make the `array_insert` function 1-based for negative indexes. So, the maximum index is -1 should point out to the last element, and the function should insert new element at the end of the given array for the index -1.\r\n\r\nThe old behaviour can be restored via the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.negativeIndexInArrayInsert`.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42564\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.  To match the behaviour of functions such as `substr()` and `element_at()`.\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select element_at(array('a', 'b'), -1), substr('ab', -1);\r\nb\tb\r\n```\r\n2. To fix an inconsistency in `array_insert` in which positive indexes are 1-based, but negative indexes are 0-based.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select array_insert(array('a', 'b'), -1, 'c');\r\n[\"a\",\"c\",\"b\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> select array_insert(array('a', 'b'), -1, 'c');\r\n[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly
