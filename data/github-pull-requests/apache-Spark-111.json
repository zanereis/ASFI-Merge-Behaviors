What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPreviously, the `avg` function was missing in the `GroupedData` class. This patch adds this method and the necessary plan transformation using an unresolved function. In addition, it identified a small issue where when an alias is used for a grouping column, the planner would incorrectly try to wrap the existing alias expression using an unresolved alias which would then fail.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf = (\r\n    self.connect.range(10)\r\n    .groupBy((col(\"id\") % lit(2)).alias(\"moded\"))\r\n    .avg(\"id\")\r\n    .sort(\"moded\")\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBug / Compatibility\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

However, spark-21138 accidentally reverted/undid that change when fixing the \"Wrong FS\" bug. Now, we are seeing spark-3900 reported by our users at Linkedin. We need to bring back the fix for spark-3900.\r\n\r\nThe illegalStateException when creating a new filesystem object is due to the limitation in hadoop that we can not register a shutdownhook during shutdown. So, when a spark job fails during pre-launch, as part of shutdown, cleanupStagingDir would be called. Then, if we attempt to create a new filesystem object for the first time, hadoop would try to register a hook to shutdown KeyProviderCache when creating a ClientContext for DFSClient. As a result, we hit the illegalStateException. We should avoid the creation of a new filesystem object in cleanupStagingDir() when it is called in a shutdown hook. This was introduced in spark-3900. However, spark-21138 accidentally reverted/undid that change. We need to bring back that fix to Spark to avoid the illegalStateException.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

When I tested it, it is very bad experience to me.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1) In my k8s environment, i tested the code.\r\n2)

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEnables creating generated columns in CREATE/REPLACE TABLE statements by specifying a generation expression for a column with GENERATED ALWAYS AS expr.\r\n\r\nFor example the following will be supported:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE default.example (\r\n    time TIMESTAMP,\r\n    date DATE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CAST(time AS DATE))\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo be more specific this PR\r\n1. Adds parser support for `GENERATED ALWAYS AS expr` in create/replace table statements. Generation expressions are temporarily stored in the field's metadata, and then are parsed/verified in `DataSourceV2Strategy` and used to instantiate v2 [Column](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/Column.java).\r\n4. Adds `TableCatalog::capabilities()` and `TableCatalogCapability.SUPPORTS_CREATE_TABLE_WITH_GENERATED_COLUMNS` This will be used to determine whether to allow specifying generation expressions or whether to throw an exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`GENERATED ALWAYS AS` is SQL standard. These changes will allow defining generated columns in create/replace table statements in Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUsing `GENERATED ALWAYS AS expr` in CREATE/REPLACE table statements will no longer throw a parsing error. When used with a supporting table catalog the query should progress, when used with a nonsupporting catalog there will be an analysis exception.\r\n\r\nPrevious behavior:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE default.example (\r\n         >     time TIMESTAMP,\r\n         >     date DATE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CAST(time AS DATE))\r\n         > )\r\n         > ;\r\nError in query: \r\nSyntax error at or near 'GENERATED'(line 3, pos 14)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\nCREATE TABLE default.example (\r\n    time TIMESTAMP,\r\n    date DATE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (CAST(time AS DATE))\r\n--------------^^^\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\n```\r\nAnalysisException: [UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.TABLE_OPERATION] The feature is not supported: Table `my_tab` does not \r\nsupport creating generated columns with GENERATED ALWAYS AS expressions. Please check the current catalog and \r\nnamespace to make sure the qualified table name is expected, and also check the catalog implementation which is \r\nconfigured by \"spark.sql.catalog\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdds unit tests\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are two main ways to construct `StructType`:\r\n\r\n- Primary constructor\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncase class StructType(fields: Array[StructField])\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Use `Seq` as input constructor\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndef apply(fields: Seq[StructField]): StructType = StructType(fields.toArray)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese two construction methods are widely used in Spark, but the latter requires an additional collection conversion.\r\n\r\nThis pr changes the following 3 scenarios to use primary constructor to reduce one collection conversion:\r\n\r\n1. For manually create `Seq` input scenes, change to use manually create `Array` input instead, for examaple:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bcf03fe3f86a7230fd977c059b73a58554370d5d/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/image/ImageSchema.scala#L55-L63\r\n\r\n2. For the scenario where `toSeq` is added to create input for compatibility with Scala 2.13, directly call 'toArray' to instead, for example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bcf03fe3f86a7230fd977c059b73a58554370d5d/connector/avro/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/avro/SchemaConverters.scala#L108-L113\r\n\r\n3. For scenes whose input is originally `Array`, remove the redundant `toSeq`, for example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bcf03fe3f86a7230fd977c059b73a58554370d5d/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/types/StructType.scala#L587-L592\r\n\r\nAll changes involved are local variables, and the input array will not escape and be accidentally change, so it is safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce unnecessary collection conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Manually test with Scala 2.13, all UTs passed","created_at":"2022-11-27T06:07:16Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T14:21:53Z","closed_at":"2022-11-30T14:21:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f1ae5114bd9c79431c13ee8439a32715ec8af63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

To maintain API Compatibility we need to promote `Column` in Connect. Also Connect has its special needs to maintain a series of `to_proto` methods to convert expressions to proto representation.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n1. Promote `Column` to be the first class citizen.\r\n2. Wrap `Expression` into `Column` and do not expose it into DataFrame.\r\n\r\n**The main idea of this PR**\r\nWe wrap `Expression` into `Column` and only expose `Column` to DataFrame API surface. In this concept, `Column` is the public API that user access (along with functions.py which offer a rich set of ways to create columns). `Expression` serve as internal API to differentiate different types of columns and also build a bridge between Python and Connect protobuf.\r\n\r\nIt is not decided yet if `plan.py` or Logical Plan should deal with Expression or Column, and same for `str` versus `Column` or `Expression`.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples as the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClass Column:\r\n   def __init__(self, expr: Expression): \r\n         self._expr = expr;\r\n    \r\n    def like(self: \"Column\", other: str) -> \"Column\":\r\n         # UnresolvedFunction extends Expression for `like` operation\r\n         # LiteralExpression as expression to carry `str` which is the function paramter.\r\n         return Column(UnresolvedFunction(\"like\",  self, Column(LiteralExpression(str)))\r\n         \r\n\r\ndf.select(df.data, df.data.like(\"secret\")).collect()\r\n\r\ndata | bool\r\ntest | False\r\nsecret | True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Caveats:**\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n\r\n**Alternative approach:** \r\nWe keep `Column` as a base class and other expressions inherits it. Still only use `Column` in DataFrame API surface. \r\n\r\n```\r\nClass Column:\r\n   def __init__(self, expr: Expression): \r\n         self._expr = expr;\r\n    \r\n    def like(self: \"Column\", other: str) -> \"Column\":\r\n         return cast(Column, UnresolvedFunction(\"like\",  self, LiteralExpression(str)))\r\n         \r\ndf.select(df.data, df.data.like(\"secret\")).collect()\r\n```         \r\n\r\n**Caveats:**\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nintroduce a new node `WindowGroupLimit` to filter out unnecessary rows based on rank computed on partial dataset.\r\n\r\nit supports following pattern:\r\n```\r\nSELECT (... (row_number|rank|dense_rank)()\r\n    OVER (\r\nPARTITION BY ...\r\nORDER BY  ... ) AS rn)\r\nWHERE rn (==|<|<=) k\r\n        AND other conditions\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor these three rank-like functions (row_number|rank|dense_rank), the rank of a key computed on partial dataset always <= its final rank computed on the whole dataset，so we can safely discard rows with partial rank > k, anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a per-window-group limit before and after the shuffle to reduce the input data of window processing.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the before-shuffle per-window-group limit:\r\n\r\n1. adds some row comparison to determine window group boundaries and rank values.\r\n\r\n2. applies per-window-group limit to reduce the data size of shuffle, and all the downstream operators.\r\n\r\nThis is beneficial, assuming the per-window-group data size is large. Otherwise, the method to determine window group boundaries is pure overhead. The config `spark.sql.window.group.limit.threshold` could avoid the overhead if the per-window-group data size is small enough.\r\n\r\nThe after-shuffle per-window-group limit just applies a per-window-group limit to reduce the data size of window processing. This is very cheap as it only needs to iterate the sorted data (window operator needs to sort the input) once and do some row comparison to determine group boundaries and rank values. It's more efficient to merge it into the window operator, but probably doesn't worth it as the overhead is small.\r\n\r\nThis PR also take over some functions from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34367.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. reduce the shuffle write\r\n2. solve skewed-window problem.\r\n3. improve the performance and TPC-DS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation and add a new config.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. new test suites\r\n2. new micro benchmark\r\n```\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_311-b11 on Mac OS X 10.16\r\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\nBenchmark Top-K:                                                 Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nROW_NUMBER (PARTITION: , WindowGroupLimit: false)                        10711          11068         363          2.0         510.8       1.0X\r\nROW_NUMBER (PARTITION: , WindowGroupLimit: true)                          2611           2929         210          8.0         124.5       4.1X\r\nROW_NUMBER (PARTITION: PARTITION BY b, WindowGroupLimit: false)          23829          24085         178          0.9        1136.2       0.4X\r\nROW_NUMBER (PARTITION: PARTITION BY b, WindowGroupLimit: true)            6381           6515          97          3.3         304.3       1.7X\r\nRANK (PARTITION: , WindowGroupLimit: false)                              11459          11798         223          1.8         546.4       0.9X\r\nRANK (PARTITION: , WindowGroupLimit: true)                                2588           2837         162          8.1         123.4       4.1X\r\nRANK (PARTITION: PARTITION BY b, WindowGroupLimit: false)                24560          24707         108          0.9        1171.1       0.4X\r\nRANK (PARTITION: PARTITION BY b, WindowGroupLimit: true)                  6395           6530         109          3.3         304.9       1.7X\r\nDENSE_RANK (PARTITION: , WindowGroupLimit: false)                        11563          11740         124          1.8         551.3       0.9X\r\nDENSE_RANK (PARTITION: , WindowGroupLimit: true)                          2563           2819         168          8.2         122.2       4.2X\r\nDENSE_RANK (PARTITION: PARTITION BY b, WindowGroupLimit: false)          24482          24578          64          0.9        1167.4       0.4X\r\nDENSE_RANK (PARTITION: PARTITION BY b, WindowGroupLimit: true)            6368           6511         122          3.3         303.7       1.7X\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. manual test on TPC-DS\r\nTPC-DS data size: 2TB.\r\nThis improvement is valid for TPC-DS q67 and no regression for other test cases.\r\n\r\n| TPC-DS Query   | Before(Seconds)  | After(Seconds)  | Speedup(Percent)  |\r\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\r\n| q44 | 29.945 | 28.862 | 3.75% |\r\n| q67 | 997.7585 | 412.046 | 142.15% |\r\n| q70 | 20.149 | 19.955 | 0.97% |\r\n| All TPC-DS | 7076.6715 | 6472.0535 | 9.34% |\r\n\r\nThere is an extreme case for this optimization.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue for applyInPandasWithState, which is triggered with the columns of grouping keys are not placed in order from earliest. If the condition is met, user function may get \"incorrect\" value of the key, including `None`.\r\n\r\nThis is because the projection for the value is co-used between normal input row and row for timed-out state. The projection assumed that the schema for the row is same as output schema of the child node, whereas row for timed-out state is constructed via concatenating key row + null value row.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a separate projection for the row for timed-out state, so that the projection can pick up the values for grouping columns correctly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, user function may get \"incorrect\" value of the key, including `None`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This feature is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test case.","created_at":"2022-11-25T07:21:03Z","updated_at":"2022-11-27T02:01:38Z","closed_at":"2022-11-27T02:01:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2335236936e4082c22b54471558327b2c60ec9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to cast NumPy instances in `GroupState.update`.  Previously, if we pass a NumPy instance to `GroupState.update`, then it failed with an exception as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnet.razorvine.pickle.PickleException: expected zero arguments for construction of ClassDict (for numpy.dtype). This happens when an unsupported/unregistered class is being unpickled that requires construction arguments. Fix it by registering a custom IObjectConstructor for this class.\r\n\tat net.razorvine.pickle.objects.ClassDictConstructor.construct(ClassDictConstructor.java:23)\r\n\tat net.razorvine.pickle.Unpickler.load_reduce(Unpickler.java:759)\r\n\tat net.razorvine.pickle.Unpickler.dispatch(Unpickler.java:199)\r\n\tat net.razorvine.pickle.Unpickler.load(Unpickler.java:109)\r\n\tat net.razorvine.pickle.Unpickler.loads(Unpickler.java:122)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.api.python.PythonSQLUtils$.$anonfun$toJVMRow$1(PythonSQLUtils.scala:125)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`applyInPandasWithState` uses pandas instances so it is very common to extract a NumPy instance from the pandas and set it to the group state.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo because this new API is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and unittest was added.","created_at":"2022-11-25T03:30:40Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:04Z","closed_at":"2022-11-29T07:13:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"000f02be950852bebe3da4f24c20f6f6c704760e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nImplement DataFrame.withColumn(s).\r\n\r\nFor WithColumn case, there could be two approaches to implement:\r\n1. Have a dedicated proto message and implement the logic on the server side. One PRC.\r\n2. Try to re-use `Project`, requires two RPC where the first RPC get the input relation schema and. the second RPC deal with columns.\r\n\r\nThis PR chooses the first approach due to the following reasons:\r\n1. Current Connect execution mode is lazy. More than one RPC call to implement a non action API actually validates that. \r\n2. Code reuse. We are likely to have withColumns in multiple clients and approach one shares code the most.\r\n3. Users love to stack withColumns on top of each other (e.g. do analysis of all columns in a dataframe in a loop), which makes approach two even worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAPI coverage\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-24T20:46:08Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T08:28:44Z","closed_at":"2022-11-29T08:28:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b09c347d5e13f11bcb521bce9f2baafae63d82f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0c6be143c8a0125c57bdfc2020188361bd501b3c","head":{"label":"amaliujia:withColumn","ref":"withColumn","sha":"0c6be143c8a0125c57bdfc2020188361bd501b3c","user":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":434752466,"node_id":"R_kgDOGenL0g","name":"spark","full_name":"amaliujia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor better source compatibility, this PR changes the type name of RemoteSparkSession to SparkSession and follows the same builder pattern. The communication with the GRPC endpoint is kept in `client.py` whereas the public facing Spark Session related functionality is implemented in `SparkSession` in `session.py`.\r\n\r\nThe new class does not support the full behavior of the existing Spark Session. To connect to Spark Connect using the new code use the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Connection to a remote endpoint\r\nSparkSession.builder.remote(\"sc://endpoint/;config=abc\").getOrCreate()\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Local connection to a locally running server\r\nSparkSession.builder.remote().getOrCreate()\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nSparkSession.builder.conf(\"spark.connect.location\", \"sc://endpoint\").getOrCreate()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCompatibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT","created_at":"2022-11-24T20:05:53Z","updated_at":"2022-11-25T22:12:45Z","closed_at":"2022-11-25T22:12:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a72a021c2b44d38689cc6f8c4aba80869a2d44f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38792/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38792/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38792/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/71a5f51f69fa9a7241eb88a22eb3a52a486583c5","head":{"label":"grundprinzip:SPARK-41255","ref":"SPARK-41255","sha":"71a5f51f69fa9a7241eb88a22eb3a52a486583c5","user":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":503900825,"node_id":"R_kgDOHgjqmQ","name":"spark","full_name":"grundprinzip/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new test suite specifically for self-union tests on streaming query. The test cases are acceptance tests for 4 different cases, DSv1 vs DSv2 / DataStreamReader API vs table API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR brings more test coverage on streaming workloads. We should have caught an issue during the work of [SPARK-39564](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39564) if we had this test suite.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a SQL config `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` to control SPARK-40646 change. This allows us to fall back to the behaviour before the change.\r\n\r\nIt was observed that SPARK-40646 could cause a performance regression for deeply nested schemas. I, however, could not reproduce the regression with Apache Spark JSON benchmarks (maybe we need to extend them, I can do it as a follow-up). Regardless, I propose to add a SQL config to have an ability to disable the change in case of performance degradation during JSON parsing.\r\n\r\nBenchmark results are attached to the JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSQL config `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is added to control the behaviour of SPARK-40646 JSON partial results parsing. Users can disable the feature if they find any performance regressions when reading JSON files.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI extended existing unit tests to test with flag enabled and disabled.","created_at":"2022-11-24T05:14:36Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T06:01:23Z","closed_at":"2022-12-14T05:28:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10a9c374bef7c8404e9ce51b388a01632912b74c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38784/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38784/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38784/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d85134c86dac590b3fdd04cac5b7789aeeed5ed1","head":{"label":"sadikovi:add-flag-json-parsing","ref":"add-flag-json-parsing","sha":"d85134c86dac590b3fdd04cac5b7789aeeed5ed1","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR implements a new feature: Implicit lateral column alias  on `Project` case, controlled by `spark.sql.lateralColumnAlias.enableImplicitResolution` temporarily (default false now, but will turn on this conf once the feature is completely merged).\r\n\r\n#### Lateral column alias\r\nView https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27561 for more details on lateral column alias.  \r\nThere are two main cases to support: LCA in Project, and LCA in Aggregate.\r\n```sql\r\n-- LCA in Project. The base_salary references an attribute defined by a previous alias\r\nSELECT salary AS base_salary, base_salary + bonus AS total_salary\r\nFROM employee\r\n\r\n-- LCA in Aggregate. The avg_salary references an attribute defined by a previous alias\r\nSELECT dept, average(salary) AS avg_salary, avg_salary + average(bonus)\r\nFROM employee\r\nGROUP BY dept\r\n```\r\nThis **implicit** lateral column alias (no explicit keyword, e.g. `lateral.base_salary`) should be supported.\r\n\r\n#### High level design\r\nThis PR defines a new Resolution rule, `ResolveLateralColumnAlias` to resolve the implicit lateral column alias, covering the `Project` case.\r\nIt introduces a new leaf node NamedExpression, `LateralColumnAliasReference`, as a placeholder used to hold a referenced that has been temporarily resolved as the reference to a lateral column alias.\r\n\r\nThe whole process is generally divided into two phases:\r\n1) recognize **resolved** lateral alias, wrap the attributes referencing them with `LateralColumnAliasReference`.\r\n 2) when the whole operator is resolved, unwrap `LateralColumnAliasReference`. For Project, it further resolves the attributes and push down the referenced lateral aliases to the new Project.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n// Before\r\nProject [age AS a, 'a + 1]\r\n+- Child\r\n\r\n// After phase 1\r\nProject [age AS a, lateralalias(a) + 1]\r\n+- Child\r\n\r\n// After phase 2\r\nProject [a, a + 1]\r\n+- Project [child output, age AS a]\r\n   +- Child\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Resolution order\r\nGiven this new rule, the name resolution order will be (higher -> lower):\r\n```\r\nlocal table column > local metadata attribute > local lateral column alias > all others (outer reference of subquery, parameters of SQL UDF, ..)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a recent refactor that moves the creation of `OuterReference` in the Resolution batch: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38851.\r\nBecause lateral column alias has higher resolution priority than outer reference, it will try to resolve an `OuterReference` using lateral column alias, similar as an `UnresolvedAttribute`. If success, it strips `OuterReference` and also wraps it with `LateralColumnAliasReference`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe lateral column alias is a popular feature wanted for a long time. It is supported by lots of other database vendors (Redshift, snowflake, etc) and provides a better user experience.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, as shown in the above example, it will be able to resolve lateral column alias. I will write the migration guide or release note when most PRs of this feature are merged.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests and newly added

the rules is \"[Identical expressions should not be used on both sides of a binary operator.](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?languages=py&resolved=false&rules=python%3AS1764&id=spark-python)\"\r\nThere are a lot of this 278 total, in pandas API test code. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR will remove tests where we compare identical expressions on both sides. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsing the same value on either side of a binary operator is almost always a mistake. In the case of logical operators, it is either a copy/paste error and therefore a bug, or it is simply wasted code, and should be simplified. In the case of bitwise operators and most binary mathematical operators, having the same value on both sides of an operator yields predictable results, and should be simplified.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-23T14:07:28Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T14:32:27Z","closed_at":"2022-11-30T13:54:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4e260aa462f92d95b8d2d42a97b20b125bf65b1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes that Relations (e.g. Aggregate in this PR) should only deal with  `Expression` than `str`. `str` could be mapped to different expressions (e.g. sql expression, unresolved_attribute, etc.). Relations are not supposed to understand the difference of `str` but DataFrame should understand it.\r\n\r\nThis PR specifically changes for `Aggregate`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCodebase refactoring.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n No\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

request?\r\n\r\nRestore dbName and tableName in `HiveShim.getTable()` method.\r\n\r\nWhen we create a hive table, hive will convert the dbName and tableName in lower case: https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-2.3.9-rc0/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/ObjectStore.java#L1446-L1482\r\n\r\nAnd then throw an exception in `Hive.alterTable()`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-2.3.9-rc0/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/metadata/Hive.java#L623\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n* We want to create a table called `tAb_I`\r\n* Hive metastore will check if the table name is valid by `MetaStoreUtils.validateName(tbl.getTableName())`\r\n* Hive will call `HiveStringUtils.normalizeIdentifier(tbl.getTableName())` and then save the save the table name to lower case, **but after setting the local to \"tr\", it will be `tab_ı` which is not a valid table name**\r\n* When we run alter table command, we will first get the hive table from hive metastore which is not a valid table name.\r\n* Update some properties or other, and then try to save it to hive metastore.\r\n* Hive metastore will check if the table name is valid and then throw exception `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: [tab_ı]: is not a valid table name`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBug fix for alter table command.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd UT\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-23T06:49:12Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T08:19:33Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T08:19:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a329218e2bfa9c031bf4d4892d4661f48588e168","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38765/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38765/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38765/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/35e9dee4120395bef088e20d84dd360471472038","head":{"label":"wankunde:write_stats_directly2","ref":"write_stats_directly2","sha":"35e9dee4120395bef088e20d84dd360471472038","user":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260172941,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNzI5NDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"wankunde/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n0 is a special case for decimal which data type can be Decimal(0, 0), to be safe we should use decimal(1, 0) to represent 0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix data correctness for regression.\r\n\r\nWe do not promote the decimal precision since we refactor decimal binary operater in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36698. However, it causes the intermediate decimal type of `IntegralDivide` returns decimal(0, 0). It's dangerous that Spark does not actually support decimal(0, 0). e.g.\r\n```sql\r\n-- work with in-memory catalog\r\ncreate table t (c decimal(0, 0)) using parquet;\r\n-- fail with parquet\r\n-- java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid DECIMAL precision: 0\r\n--\tat org.apache.parquet.Preconditions.checkArgument(Preconditions.java:57)\r\ninsert into table t values(0);\r\n\r\n-- fail with hive catalog\r\n-- Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Decimal precision out of allowed range [1,38]\r\n--\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.typeinfo.HiveDecimalUtils.validateParameter(HiveDecimalUtils.java:44)\r\ncreate table t (c decimal(0, 0)) using parquet;\r\n```\r\nAnd decimal(0, 0) means the data is 0, so to be safe we use decimal(1, 0) to represent 0 for `IntegralDivide`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake `RangePartitioning` take a new parameter  `planForSample`, so we can pass the it to `ShuffleExchangeExec`.\r\n\r\nAdd a new rule `OptimizeSampleForRangePartitioning` to infer the `planForSample` if has benefit at preparations phase.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen do a global sort or repartition by range, firstly we do sample to get the range bounds, then use the range partitioner to do shuffle exchange.\r\n\r\nThe issue is, the plan for sample is coupled with the original query. What we need for sample plan is the columns for sort order but the original query plan contains all data columns. So we can do column pruning for the sample plan to only fetch the ordering columns.\r\n\r\nA common example is: `OPTIMIZE table ZORDER BY columns`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno it's improve performance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd tests\r\n\r\nperformace test:\r\n```\r\nval rows = 1000000\r\nval columns = (0 until(200)).map(i =>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to move out the error sub-classes related to number format issues from `DATATYPE_MISMATCH` to their own error class `INVALID_FORMAT`. Also, the PR deletes the error class `INVALID_LIKE_PATTERN`, and moves their sub-classes to `INVALID_FORMAT`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve usability of Spark SQL and to don't confuse users by error class names related to values but to to its types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes some user-facing errors.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a backport PR of #38333.\r\nWhen push-based shuffle is enabled, a zero-size buf error may occur when fetching shuffle chunks from bad nodes, especially when memory is full. In this case, we can fall back to original shuffle blocks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the reduce task obtains the shuffle chunk with a zero-size buf, we let it fall back to original shuffle block. After verification, these blocks can be read successfully without shuffle retry.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch
