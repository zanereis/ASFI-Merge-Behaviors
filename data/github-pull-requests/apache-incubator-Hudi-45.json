The checkpoint of the target Hudi table from the incremental ETL lags behind the source if the ingestion runs at a lower frequency than the source or the ingestion job stalls for some time, causing the data freshness issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR increases default num_instants to 5 so that the incremental ETL can fetch more instants to catch up with the source.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOnly in the cases mentioned above, more instants are fetched for catchup.\r\n\r\n### Risk level \r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCreated better error messages so that users can figure out how they filled out the pr incorrectly\r\nChanged risk level section in the template because it was confusing to some

Validation for this does not check for \"(write none, low medium or high below)\" because I think some users might delete that.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis should allow users to be able to fix their incorrectly filled out pr without help from me\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\nOverall execution path should not be changed at all, so I don't expect the script to fail.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no consistency for avro/parquet-avro dependecies in bundles. In some, they are included but not shaded (like hudi-gcp-bundle, hudi-hive-sync-bundle), while some have included and shaded both, and scopes are also not consistent. This PR ensures that these two dependecies are included and shaded in all bundles except hudi-timeline-server-bundle where these are not required at all.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public API

The current test case works fine with metadata table disabled. There is some issue with respect to syncing file system view after a clean has happened when metadata table is enabled. Filed a jira for this - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5015 and added a placeholder for this case in TestCleanPlanExecutor class.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOnly tests.\r\n\r\n**Risk level:

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf users create an incrementalRelation while join another existing hive hudi table, as pathFilter is unset inside incrementalRelation, all files under hive hudi table will be selected.\r\n\r\nNow HoodieROTablePathFilter can accept as.of.instant to do the time travel, so instead we pass as.of.instant to the dataframe(not change spark hadoop conf globally) to avoid this issue.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low**\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the

and log files\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, for timestamp type, we use LongWrapper for parquet and TimestampMicrosWrapper for avro log, they may keep different precision val here, for example, with timestamp(3), LongWrapper keeps the val as a millisecond long from EPOCH instant, while TimestampMicrosWrapper keeps the val as micro-seconds.\r\n\r\nFor spark, there is no ambiguity because it uses micro-seconds internally for timestamp type value, while flink uses the TimestampData internally, we better keeps the same precision for better compatibility here.\r\n\r\n### Change

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe were hitting `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException: File /tmp/junit4261601287653285825/.test-fileid1_100.log.1_1-0-1 could only be replicated to 0 nodes instead of minReplication (=1).  There are 1 datanode(s) running and no node(s) are excluded in this operation. ` \r\n\r\nFrom researching around, it was related to namenode and datanode connectivity issues for the most part. \r\n\r\nRef links: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5293446/hdfs-error-could-only-be-replicated-to-0-nodes-instead-of-1\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/15571584/writing-to-hdfs-could-only-be-replicated-to-0-nodes-instead-of-minreplication\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/54561086/how-do-i-fix-file-could-only-be-replicated-to-0-nodes-instead-of-minreplication\r\n\r\nOne answer in particular was referring to the issue which resulted in this fix. When a file is open, blocks are reserved for it and the default value is 128MB. So, if lot of concurrent files were open, we might end up in lower disk space and hence hdfs may not be able to proceed. Since we run tests in parallel, these are bound to happen. So, making a fix to reduce the dfs block size to 16MB.\r\n\r\nAlso, looking at some other tests, realized that we are not cleaning up the base temp directory in tear down. Fixed that as well. With both the fixes, I have ran the azure CI thrice and its consistently passing now. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none *\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nJIRA: HUDI-5002. Improve SparkHoodieHBaseIndex#generateStatement With Hbase Recommend Method.\r\n\r\nWhen I read the code, I found that SparkHoodieHBaseIndex#generateStatement uses Hbase's deprecated method(setMaxVersion), I replaced it with new method.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55643692/194879918-04d4e531-902c-4b0f-b9dc-d4b188f7a45c.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate Get generateStatement(String key) throws IOException {\r\n  return new Get(Bytes.toBytes(getHBaseKey(key))).setMaxVersions(1).addColumn(SYSTEM_COLUMN_FAMILY, COMMIT_TS_COLUMN)\r\n      .addColumn(SYSTEM_COLUMN_FAMILY, FILE_NAME_COLUMN).addColumn(SYSTEM_COLUMN_FAMILY, PARTITION_PATH_COLUMN);\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none**\r\n\r\nDoes not affect the original logic, use a recommend method to replace.\r\n\r\n_Choose one.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis issue is within the scope of row sources. The actual issue is that if the names of the columns in the row sources contain invalid avro characters ref [here|https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.10.2/spec.html#names] then using configuration set we can sanitize the column names both in the schema and actual data and the data ingestion to hudi isn't failed. The schema provider is scoped out to filebasedschemaregistry as other schema registries might not allow to register invalid schema in the first place.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact by default because configs are turned off by default. If turned on, data and schema(file based) are repaired, so the dataset contains renamed columns.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow (as it has to be turned on explicitly).\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis patch has 2 fixes: \r\n1. This is a re-attempt of https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6580\r\nThis makes use of batch call to get fileGroup to delete during cleaning instead of 1 call per partition.\r\nThis limit the number of call to the view and should fix the perf hit in context of lot of partitions.\r\n#fixes https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/6373\r\n\r\n2. Recently we added last completed commit timestamp to clean plan. But we missed to take into consideration multi-writers. So, have fixed the last completed commit to represent the last completed commit before any inflights in timeline. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWill improve clean planning latency for tables with large partitions. \r\n\r\n**Risk level:  medium**\r\n\r\nUsers reported latencies of 20 mins just for clean planning phase. This is expected to cut down the latency by a lot. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-4994\r\n\r\nDatahub has a notion of soft-deletes (the entity still exists in the database with a status=removed:true). Such entities could get re-ingested with new properties at a later time, such that the older one gets overwritten. The current implementation in DatahubSyncTool does not handle this scenario. It fails to update the status flag to removed:false during ingest, which means the entity won't surface in the Datahub UI at all.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that, via setting status=\"removed:false\" into the metadata object. This will have no impact on new entities, or hard-deleted entities (which will have nothing inside Datahub anyway)\r\n\r\nRef: See sections on Soft Delete and Hard Delete in the Datahub docs: https://datahubproject.io/docs/how/delete-metadata/#soft-delete-the-default.\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSoft-deleted entities will re-surface in UI if re-ingested again, compared to existing behaviour.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low**\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe have had issues where stages involving writing data to disk were de-referenced multiple times which should not be happening. We are putting in guard rails so avoid such mis-steps.In this patch, we take control of the dag and trigger de-referencing of actual write and create Rdd again so that any downstream callers will never be able to trigger previous write stage by mistake. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWe are changing our dag in the sense that, when exactly the write happens will change after this patch. \r\n\r\n**Risk level: high**\r\n\r\nWe are changing the dag since we are explicitly de-referencing. For eg, incase of auto commit disable, after writeclient.insert() returns to the caller and if caller tries to dereference WriteStatus, the actual execution kicks in and the write gets triggered. But after this change, it may not be the case. Write will get triggered just before index update irrespective of whether auto commit is enabled or disabled. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNot applicable. \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-4882\r\n\r\nThis feature aims to improve PartialUpdatePayload to handle multiple sources properly, it also can fix null value update issue\r\n\r\nThis feature will allow users to perform partial updates across sub-tables/sources by determining the state of a set of columns in a row based on an ordering/precombine column.\r\n\r\nAs such, a table can have MULTIPLE ordering fields.\r\n\r\nThis use case is suitable for wide Hudi tables that are created from smaller sub-tables, where each of its sub-tables has its own precombine column, and where its records could be upserted out of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n**Risk level: none | low | medium | high**\r\n\r\n_Choose one. If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCalculate average record size for Spark upsert partitioner based on commit instants only. Previously it's based on commit and replacecommit, of which the latter may be created by clustering which has inaccurately smaller average record sizes, which could result in OOM due to size underestimation.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSkip replacecommit for calculating average record size may also skip stats from insert overwrite. If a timeline only contains replacecommit from insert overwrite, the average record size will fall back to user-defined estimated size (`hoodie.copyonwrite.record.size.estimate`). The impact is small as commits will follow and subsequently improve the calculation results.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low**\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf a new table initialization failed mid-way ( for eg, after creating .hoodie dir, archived dir, etc, but before creating hoodie.properties file, the process crashed), restarting deltastreamer will fail, bcoz there is no hoodie.properties nor hoodie.properties.backup. This patch is fixing it. \r\n\r\n1: If table initialization failed and deltastreamer is restarted, we will re-initiate the table again and continue \r\n2: If hoodie.properties is missing after few valid commits, we fail the pipeline. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nDeltastreamer initialization failures will be resilient here after. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added

Change Logs\r\nThe rangeBucket is mainly used in the scenario of sync mysql tables to hudi in near real time, which avoids the disadvantage of the fixed number of buckets in simpleBucket.\r\n\r\nUsually, in the mysql table, there is an auto-increment id primary key field. In the mysql cdc synchronization scenario, we can use the database name and table name as the partition field of hudi, and id as the primary key field of the hudi table，This can deal with sub-library and sub-table. \r\n\r\nIn order to reach better sync performance, we usually use bucket index, but if we use simple bucket index, because the number of buckets is fixed, it is difficult for us to determine a suitable number of buckets, and as the table grows, The previous number of buckets will no longer be appropriate. \r\n\r\nSo, I propose rangeBucekt, in the simpleBucket index, the bucket number is （hash % bucketNum）, and in rangetBucket, we will use （ id / fixedStep） to determine the bucket number, so that as the id grows，The number of buckets also increases. For example, if step = 10 is set, then, because the id is self-increasing, a bucket will be generated for every 10 pieces of data.\r\n\r\nIn the actual scenario, I set step=1,000,000, the usual size of each mysql record is similar, then the approximate size of each bucket will be 50M ~ 350M, which avoids the disadvantage of the fixed number of buckets in simpleBucket\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nIntroduce a new index RANGE_BUCKET, people can ust it like following:\r\n\r\n      option(HoodieIndexConfig.INDEX_TYPE.key, IndexType.BUCKET.name()).\r\n      option(HoodieIndexConfig.BUCKET_INDEX_ENGINE_TYPE.key, \"RANGE_BUCKET\").\r\n      option(HoodieIndexConfig.RANGE_BUCKET_STEP_SIZE.key, 2).\r\n      option(HoodieLayoutConfig.LAYOUT_TYPE.key, \"BUCKET\").\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nUpdate misleading `read.streaming.skip_compaction` and `read.streaming.skip_clustering`config. \r\n\r\nEditing the description here since the description is used to generate the doc-site's config page.\r\n\r\nAdded more concrete examples on when duplicated data might occur when reading Hudi tables using Hudi-on-Flink.\r\n\r\n#### Compaction\r\nIf the consumer reads [faster than/completes before] any compaction instants + `hoodie.compaction.preserve.commit.metadata` is set to false (non-default value), the commit timeline will look something like this:\r\n\r\n1. commit_0 (write to log0)\r\n2. read_1 (read records that are written into log0)\r\n3. compaction_2 (compact log0 `commit_instant` metadata is now changed to compaction_2, assume compaction completes before the next read)\r\n4. read_3 (second read will read out the compacted records from log0 again as the commit instant metadata is modified to a newer instant that is larger than `issuedInstant` in `StreamReadMonitoringFunction`.\r\n\r\n#### Clustering\r\nIf the consumer reads [faster than/completes before] any clustering instants + `hoodie.clustering.preserve.commit.metadata` is set to false (non-default value), the commit timeline will look something like this:\r\n\r\n1. commit_0 (write to {base0, base1})\r\n2. read_1 (read records that are written into {base0, base1})\r\n3. clustering_2 (cluster {base0, base1} to produce {base3} `commit_instant` metadata is now changed to clustering_2, assume clustering completes before the next read)\r\n4. read_3 (second read will read out the clustered records from {base3}, which is essentially {base0, base1} again as the commit instant metadata is modified to a newer instant that is larger than `issuedInstant` in `StreamReadMonitoringFunction`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level: none | low | medium | high\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n- Configuration description for `read.streaming.skip_compaction` is modified to allow for easier comprehension\r\n- Configuration description for `read.streaming.skip_clustering` is modified to allow for easier comprehension\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWith Hudi's OCC, one of the commit is expected to fail if there are overalapping writes. From a user's standpoint, very likely user may retry the failed write w/o any additional action. So, adding a retry functionality to spark datasource writes with hudi automatically incase of conflict failures. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUser experience w/ multi-writers will be improved with these automatic retries. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\nUsers should enable the retries w/ caution since it could keep retrying the failed commit again until max retries are exhausted. Could result in some compute cost for large batches. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n- Configs introduced \r\n   - `hoodie.write.num.retries.on.conflict.failures` : max number of times to retry on conflict failures. Default is 0 i.e. no retry.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue reported in #6281.\r\n\r\nFor Deltastreamer, when using `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator` with the customized output dateformat (`hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.output.dateformat`) of partition path containing slashes, e.g., \"yyyy/MM/dd\", and hive-style partitioning disabled (by default), the meta sync fails.  Relevant key generator configs are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--hoodie-conf hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field=createdDate\r\n--hoodie-conf hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.class=org.apache.hudi.keygen.TimestampBasedKeyGenerator\r\n--hoodie-conf hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.timezone=GMT\r\n--hoodie-conf hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.output.dateformat=yyyy/MM/dd\r\n--hoodie-conf hoodie.deltastreamer.keygen.timebased.timestamp.type=EPOCHMILLISECONDS \r\n```\r\nHive Sync exception:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hudi.hive.HoodieHiveSyncException: Failed to sync partitions for table test_table\r\n...\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hudi.hive.HoodieHiveSyncException: default.test_table add partition failed\r\n...\r\nCaused by: MetaException(message:Invalid partition key & values; keys [createddate, ], values [2022, 10, 02, ])\r\n    at org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.ThriftHiveMetastore$add_partitions_req_result$add_partitions_req_resultStandardScheme.read(ThriftHiveMetastore.java)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nGlue Sync exception:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieException: Could not sync using the meta sync class org.apache.hudi.aws.sync.AwsGlueCatalogSyncTool\r\n...\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hudi.aws.sync.HoodieGlueSyncException: Fail to add partitions to default.test_table\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.aws.sync.AWSGlueCatalogSyncClient.addPartitionsToTable(AWSGlueCatalogSyncClient.java:147)\r\n...\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hudi.com.amazonaws.services.glue.model.InvalidInputException: The number of partition keys do not match the number of partition values (Service: AWSGlue; Status Code: 400; Error Code: InvalidInputException; Request ID: <>; Proxy: null)\r\n\tat org.apache.hudi.com.amazonaws.http.AmazonHttpClient$RequestExecutor.handleErrorResponse(AmazonHttpClient.java:1819)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe exception is thrown because the partition values for meta sync are not properly extracted.  In the current logic, \"hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.partition_extractor_class\" determines the partition extractor to use and in such a case, the `MultiPartKeysValueExtractor` is inferred to be used.  The root cause is that this extractor splits the parts by slashes, i.e., `2022/10/02` -> `[2022, 10, 02]`, instead of treating it as a single value, as there is only one partition column.  In general, if user specifies the output dateformat to contain slashes, that fails the extraction.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem by introducing a new partition extractor, `SinglePartPartitionValueExtractor`, so that we treat the partition value as a whole when there is only a single partition column, instead of relying on `MultiPartKeysValueExtractor`.  The slash (`/`) is replaced by dash (`-`), as slashes are encoded by default, making it inconvenient for querying.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low**\r\n\r\nThe fix is tested locally with Hive sync and on EMR with Glue Sync.  Before this fix, the meta sync fails.  After the fix, the meta sync succeeds.  The correct partitions can be shown: beeline (with `show partitions test_table;`) in Hive and Glue web UI for Glue Data Catalog.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe need to improve the docs for meta sync with `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator`.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen metadata table is just getting initialized, but first commit is not yet fully complete(or lets say metadata initialization failed mid-way), reading from metadata table could fail w/ the stacktrace posted in the linked jira. Fixing the read of hudi table to fallback to FS based listing if FILES partition in metadata table if not yet ready to serve data. \r\nAlso, if user sets \"hoodie.metadata.enable\" = true while querying, even if metadata table is not available, we try to fetch from metadata table. Have fixed the same in this patch as well. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers should not see any failures or data loss while reading from hudi table if metadata table initialization is happening or if it fails mid-way.\r\n\r\n**Risk level: low **\r\n\r\n_Choose one. If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSkip checking corrupt log blocks for transactional write file systems\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n- The benchmark results show corrupted block check could be 100's of msecs for larger file sizes.\r\n- This change would boost block read of 100's of ms per block.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n- Only turned on S3 and GCS for this feature, those for sure supports transactional write.\r\n- For other file systems, there's no change.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nIt can be considered a small feature, probably worth mentioning that for cloud storage with transactional write support, there're certain optimization around it.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-29T14:02:10Z","updated_at":"2023-01-25T07:52:34Z","closed_at":"2023-01-25T07:52:34Z","merged_at":"2023-01-25T07:52:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"65044d38fbefc6af644be02197bb8b1911746202","assignee":{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2177611461,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc3NjExNDYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"a6fcaf","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4210243667,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM768zhT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/reader-core","name":"reader-core","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/6830/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/6830/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/6830/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/e4092aa1a724cf820113cef5223cfad011c53e26","head":{"label":"giftbowen:bowen/transactionalwrite","ref":"bowen/transactionalwrite","sha":"e4092aa1a724cf820113cef5223cfad011c53e26","user":{"login":"giftbowen","id":12295096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjk1MDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12295096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen","html_url":"https://github.com/giftbowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":517150225,"node_id":"R_kgDOHtMWEQ","name":"hudi","full_name":"giftbowen/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"giftbowen","id":12295096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjk1MDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12295096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen","html_url":"https://github.com/giftbowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftbowen/
