restoring a batch of records, `RocksDBStore` was iterating the `ConsumerRecord`s, building a list of `KeyValue`s, and then iterating _that_ list of `KeyValue`s to add them to the RocksDB batch.\r\n\r\nSimply adding the key and value directly to the RocksDB batch prevents this unnecessary second iteration, and the creation of itermediate `KeyValue` objects, improving the performance of state restoration, and reducing unnecessary object allocation.\r\n\r\nThis also simplifies the API of `RocksDBAccessor`, as `prepareBatchForRestore` is no longer

Greg Harris <greg.harris@aiven.io>\r\n\r\nThe GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS for the Trogdor JsonRestServer is 100ms. In heavily loaded CI environments, this timeout can be exceeded. When this happens, it causes the jettyServer.stop() and jettyServer.destroy() calls to throw exceptions, which prevents shutdownExecutor.shutdown() from running. This has the effect of causing the JsonRestServer::waitForShutdown method to block for 1 day, which exceeds the 120s timeout on the CoordinatorTest (and any other test relying on MiniTrogdorCluster).\r\n\r\nThis change makes it such that the graceful shutdown timeout is less likely to be exceeded, and when it is, the timeout does not cause the waitForShutdown method to block for much longer than the graceful shutdown timeout.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

all RestClient methods are static, and require more complicated mocking mechanisms compared to an implementation which uses instance methods.\r\n\r\nThis change refactors all of the static methods into instance methods, and passes around a single initialized RestClient throughout the RestServer, ConnectorsResource, and DistributedHerder. This restClient can be more easily mocked by dependency injection rather than static mocking.\r\n\r\nNote: This has one potential change in semantics: Previously the HttpClient was initialized for SSL only when a remote `https://` url was provided, and otherwise just created an HTTP client without an ssl context. Now, the HttpClient is unconditionally created with an SSL context, even if the worker/other workers are configured to use HTTP listeners. The HttpClient javadoc indicates that an HttpClient which is configured with an ssl context can still make outbound requests to destinations over http. Thus this _should_ be a lateral change.\r\n\r\nDuring the implementation, I realized that the ConnectorsResource handles request forwarding to other nodes in a distributed cluster, and uses the RestClient to do so. In a standalone connect instance, this error handling is still present on the code-path, but because no standalone herder calls throw RequestTargetException, the error handling is not used.\r\n\r\nThis appears in the refactor where in Connect Standalone, the RestClient is not used in the StandaloneHerder, but a RestClient is expected in the RestServer signature. This also appears in the refactor where in MirrorMaker, the RestClient is used in the DistributedHerder, but no RestServer is started which would handle those requests. Both of these situations are left as-is in this PR, and will need follow-ups to address.\r\n\r\nA new RestForwardingIntegrationTest verifies that the restclient->restserver forwarding flow works through all stages of a rolling upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS/SSL.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Greg Harris <greg.harris@aiven.io>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

the `IncrementalCooperativeAssignor` keeps track of time i.e scheduledRebalance and delay within the class itself. While that has worked successfully, sometimes it is not very intuitive when reading the code. For example condition like \r\n`if (scheduledRebalance > 0 && now >= scheduledRebalance) {` is used to check if the scheduled rebalance delay is expired for example. Similarly, the IncrementalCooperativeAssignor also calculates delay/scheduledRebalanceDelay within the codebase. This has worked in general but there could be edge cases when the underlying clock is subject to time slips for example. \r\nThe kafka codebase already has a Timer class which can be used for tracking time and is used by other components in Kafka like Consumer, NetworkClient, AbstractCoordinator etc. It exposes methods like `isExpired`, `notExpired`, `remainingTimeMs`, `elapsedTimeMs`, `deadlineMs` and does the calculations internally. Moreover, `remainingTimeMs` maps directly to `delay` in the IncrementalCooperativeAssignor and `deadlineMs` to `scheduledRebalance`. One last nice thing about the Timer class is that it guarantees monotonic behaviour even if the underlying clock is not.\r\n\r\nThis draft PR is an attempt to use `Timer` constructs in `IncrementalCooperativeAssignor`

current dominant compareAndSwapClassLoader usage idiom in the codebase is as follows:\r\n```\r\nClassLoader savedLoader = plugins.compareAndSwapLoaders(loader);\r\ntry {\r\n     // operations which are sensitive to the thread context classloader\r\n} finally {\r\n    Plugins.compareAndSwapLoader(savedLoader);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is difficult to mock in tests due to the static method call used to swap back to the previous classloader.\r\nInstead, this operation should be managed by a non-static try-with-resources call which is more easily mocked:\r\n```\r\ntry (LoaderSwap loaderSwap = plugins.withClassLoader(loader)) {\r\n    // operations which are sensitive to the thread context classloader\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis should also be less error-prone, as there is only one statement needed to safely create a special classloading context, rather than two.\r\nI also experimented with combining the plugins.connectorLoader(String) functionality into a similar withClassLoader() call, but omitted this from the PR as it complicated error handling. As-is, the withClassLoader call should not fail due to missing plugins, whereas the connectorLoader class will intentionally fail if a connector is not found.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the title change, also clean up some unnecessary calls to Plugins::delegatingLoader, a now unused Plugins::currentThreadLoader, and a now trivial Worker::executeStateTransition. And remove the static mocking from the tests which was the impetus for this change.\r\n\r\nAlso, moved the WorkerConnector/WorkerTask thread classloader ownership out to the Worker, as all other thread classloader management was already handled from the worker side. Mechanically, this is because a WorkerConnector/WorkerTask does not have access to the Plugins object of the worker, and is effectively in a single-plugin environment. Rather than inject the Plugins instance into each of the WorkerConnector/WorkerTask, I chose to pull the isolation functionality out of the WorkerConnector/WorkerTask entirely.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by:

PR adds some of the implementation of KIP-866. Since this KIP is still under discussion, this PR should not be merged to `trunk`. \r\n\r\nA few new things are defined here:\r\n* MigrationClient: an interface in the `metadata` package that abstracts some ZK things we want to do during the migration\r\n* ZkMigrationClient: a Scala implementation of MigrationClient that has dependencies on KafkaZkClient\r\n* ZkMetadataConsumer: a callback used by the QuorumController to receive the migrated ZK data as records\r\n* KRaftMetadataListener: a callback for handling leader changes and records (this is temporary/throw-away code)\r\n* KRaftMigrationDriver: the main class that manages the state and orchestrates the migration\r\n\r\nThe multi-op ZK transaction is implemented in KafkaZkClient#retryMigrationRequestsUntilConnected. All dual writes from KRaft to ZK use this method. A new method for forcibly registering as the controller is in KafkaZkClient#tryRegisterKRaftControllerAsActiveController.\r\n\r\n\r\nA ducktape test is also included that creates a topic in ZK mode,

Greg Harris <greg.harris@aiven.io>\r\n\r\nThe existing hard-coded error bound in the test is inaccurate, such that certain patterns \r\nof request arrival cause this test to exceed the bound slightly. This has appeared in CI as\r\na flakey test run which just barely exceeds the listed bound.\r\n\r\nInstead of a hard-coded error bound which can become inaccurate if the test's parameters change,\r\ncompute the worst-case error bound based on the knowledge of the underlying windowing algorithm.\r\nFull derivation and explanation of the worst-case bound is provided in a comment in the util function.\r\nThe bound is also unit tested in a mocked-time environment which simulates the behavior of the full\r\nSocketServer's throttle servo loop, simulating a connection flood with various delays.\r\n\r\nAlso fix some IDE warnings, incorrect/misleading comments, and an AdminClient leak.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

from original PR #10475:\r\n\r\nThe default implementation, which is inheritted from ClassLoader, searches the\r\nclassloader tree from parent first. This causes issues when the resource is\r\navailable both on the classpath and the plugin path. Instead of attempting to\r\nload the resource from plugin path first, the system classloader is consulted\r\nfirst and loads the resource from classpath.\r\n\r\nA testcase is added in PluginsTest to verify this behavior is fixed by this\r\ncommit.\r\n\r\nThanks to @ncliang for the original implementation.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14342\r\n- [KafkaOffsetBackingStore](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/56d588d55ac313c0efca586a3bcd984c99a89018/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/KafkaOffsetBackingStore.java#L70) is used to track source connector offsets using a backing Kafka topic. It implements interface methods to get and set offsets using a [KafkaBasedLog](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/56d588d55ac313c0efca586a3bcd984c99a89018/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/util/KafkaBasedLog.java#L80). It also maintains an in-memory map containing {partition, offset} entries for source connectors (which is populated via the consumer callback mechanism from the KafkaBasedLog).\r\n- When a tombstone offset (i.e. Kafka message with a null value) is encountered for a source partition, the map is simply updated to make the value null for the corresponding partition key. For certain source connectors which have a lot of source partitions that are \"closed\" frequently, this can be very problematic. Imagine a file source connector which reads data from all files in a directory line-by-line (and where file appends are not tracked) - each file corresponds to a source partition here, and the offset would be the line number in the file. If there are millions of files being read, this can bring down the Connect worker due to JVM heap exhaustion (OOM) caused by the in-memory map in KafkaOffsetBackingStore growing too large.\r\n- Even if the connector writes tombstone offsets for the last record in a source partition, this doesn't help completely since we don't currently remove entries from KafkaOffsetBackingStore's in-memory offset map (so the source partition keys will stick around in the map), even though we indicate here that tombstones can be used to \"delete\" offsets - https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/56d588d55ac313c0efca586a3bcd984c99a89018/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/OffsetUtils.java#L37\r\n- This shouldn't have any other side effects because [Map::get](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#get-java.lang.Object-) returns `null` if the map contains no mapping for a key.\r\n\r\n### Committer

is a relatively minor quality of life change.\r\n\r\nCurrently, some of the various `kafka-<x>.sh` commands (which wrap various Kafka admin calls) require that `--bootstrap-server` (or, occasionally `--bootstrap-servers`) be specified in the CLI, regardless of whether that property is specified in a specified property file.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to remove that requirement. This PR may not cover all commands, but will hopefully address the most common ones. I will remove `WIP` when I've completed made these changes to several scripts (likely, kafka-broker-api-versions, kafka-topics, kafka-console-producer, and kafka-console-consumer)\r\n\r\n~As an additional quality-of-life change, kafka-console-producer and kafka-console-consumer also now support `--command-config` (in addition to continuing to support `--producer.config` and `--consumer.config`, respectively)~\r\n\r\n^ Edit 2023-01-09; this change has been reverted, as it is a change to the public interface and requires a KIP\r\n\r\nScripts updated so far:\r\n* `kafka-broker-api-versions.sh`\r\n* `kafka-topics.sh`\r\n* `kafka-console-producer.sh`\r\n* `kafka-console-consumer.sh`\r\n* `kafka-consumer-groups.sh`\r\n\r\nNot yet updated:\r\n* `kafka-configs.sh` - Is slightly more complex than the above, in that it supports alterations on different types of entities depending on the connection mechanism (zookeeper vs. brokers). Might be worth refactoring (or at least until zookeeper is completely removed). Excluded from this PR.\r\n\r\nFor example, this now works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./kafka_2.13-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/kafka-broker-api-versions.sh --command-config client.properties\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs does this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./kafka_2.13-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/kafka-topics.sh \\\r\n  --command-config client.properties \\\r\n  --list\r\nhelloworld\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* Many of these scripts aren't separately documented (aside from changelogs), so I'm not currently changing any documentation for these\r\n* There is currently minimal test coverage, so at this point I'm not adding any additional tests (but will adjust tests as applicable)\r\n* These changes should be non-breaking. Specifically:\r\n    * For situations where the flag was previously specified, it will continue to be used (and take precedence over the property file), and the command will continue to work (or not work) as it previously would\r\n    * For situations where the flag was not previously specified AND `bootstrap.servers` was _not_ configured in the property file, the command would previously fail and will continue to fail (with exit code `1`)\r\n    * For situations where the flag was not previously specified AND `bootstrap.servers` was configured in the property file, the command would previously fail; now it will work\r\n\r\nFor example, specifying ONLY the property file without `bootstrap.servers` specified will result in output that looks like this, which is fairly intuitive to address:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n./kafka_2.13-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/kafka-broker-api-versions.sh --command-config client-no-bootstrap.properties\r\nException in thread \"main\"

state updater code path put tasks into an \"initialization queue\", with created, but not initialized tasks. These are later, during the event-loop, initialized and added to the state updater.\r\n\r\nThis leads to problems, and I do not see a reason why this is necessary - we can initialize the task immediately. It can cause losing track of tasks - in particular in the state updater code path it is possible to create tasks twice, if we do not go once around `runLoop` to initialize the task. This can lead to `IllegalStateExceptions`. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this behavior by removing the initialization queue and instead initializing the tasks lazily inside the state updater thread.\r\n\r\nFor testing, I adapted the existing unit tests. I will add an integration test once this code path is stable\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and

Greg Harris <greg.harris@aiven.io>\r\n\r\nThere is existing flakiness in this test even with the previous patch to address flakiness https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11871\r\nThis should resolve the observed flakiness because the MockTime will only progress time when the test interacts with it.\r\n\r\nOne small change to the test was necessary: adding an explicit sleep within the retried operation in testNoBackoffTimeAndFail. Because the no-backoff case does not call the mockTime sleep, the test as-written would enter into an infinite retry loop, with every retry happening on the same mockTime timestamp. The test needed to be modified such that the retried operation advances the clock slightly to prevent this.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, revert the previous flakiness patch to restore the original 100ms timeouts, down from 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis should be backported to every branch that the previous flakiness fix was applied to: 2.6, 2.7,  2.8, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3.

Greg Harris <greg.harris@aiven.io>\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13989\r\n\r\nThis method is used by the REST API in the `GET /connectors?expand=info,status` call.\r\nIn cases where a connector has been created and later the connector plugin is removed, this generated a 500 error and hid the status of all other connectors. This is undesirable behavior as an error with the packaging of a single plugin severely impacts the operational visibility of the whole cluster.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should utilize the `UNKNOWN` enum value to indicate that it is currently unknown what type of connector that plugin is. This should prompt the user to further investigate the packaging issues with the plugin.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing the reported issue, also simplify some call-sites with null-checks inside of the connectorTypeForConfig method.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\nThe goal of the change is to remove excess white space surrounding topic inputs. As an example:\r\n```\r\n% ./kafka-streams-application-reset.sh --application-id streams-wordcount --bootstrap-servers <host>:9092 --input-topics \"   streams-plaintext-input,     test\" --to-earliest --force\r\nReset-offsets for input topics [   streams-plaintext-input,      test]\r\nFollowing input topics are not found, skipping them\r\nTopic:    streams-plaintext-input\r\nTopic:      test\r\nDeleting inferred internal topics [streams-wordcount-KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-STATE-STORE-0000000003-repartition, streams-wordcount-KSTREAM-AGGREGATE-STATE-STORE-0000000003-changelog]\r\nDone.\r\n```\r\nDespite the fact that the streams-plaintext-input topic does exist:\r\n```\r\n% ./kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server <host>:9092 --describe --topic streams-plaintext-input\r\nTopic: streams-plaintext-input\tTopicId: 2e7WtMnHRrShhT2F7qq7xA\tPartitionCount: 1\tReplicationFactor: 1\tConfigs: min.insync.replicas=1,segment.bytes=1073741824,retention.ms=604800000,max.message.bytes=1000000,min.cleanable.dirty.ratio=0.5,unclean.leader.election.enable=false,retention.bytes=-1,delete.retention.ms=604800000\r\n\tTopic: streams-plaintext-input\tPartition: 0\tLeader: 1546334494\tReplicas: 1546334494\tIsr: 1546334494\r\n```\r\nThis should instead trim the excess white space around the input topics and search for them. \r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\nCurrently, I've been running this change against a cluster I have access to as a means to test against it. But, I believe there should be tests for the command line tools. Where these tests are, I'm unsure. Perhaps they have to be built. \r\n\r\nI opened this as a WIP to receive input on if there are other areas where these should be trimmed or if the \"correct\" way is to sift through and better understand how things like the TopicCommand are trimming inputs and then implementing that, presumably, more standardized process in the StreamsResetter code?\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-25T20:22:16Z","updated_at":"2024-12-27T03:37:30Z","closed_at":"2024-12-27T03:37:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":851034845,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzQ4NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tools","name":"tools","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

stream allocation on hot code path.\r\n\r\n[KAFKA-14336:](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14336)\r\n\r\nWhile profiling a Kafka consumer application that utilizes `org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.Admin#listOffsets(java.util.Map<org.apache.kafka.common.TopicPartition,org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.OffsetSpec>)`, one of the largest aggregate memory allocations are coming from `org.apache.kafka.common.requests.MetadataResponse.convertToNodeArray(List, Map)` due to the use of stream reference pipeline. We can avoid allocating the stream reference pipeline & spliterator for this case by explicitly allocating the presized `Node[]` and using a for loop with `int` induction over the specified IDs `List` argument.\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$3\r\nat java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline.map(Function)\r\nat org.apache.kafka.common.requests.MetadataResponse.convertToNodeArray(List,

the tests from EasyMock to Mockito. Notes about non trivial changes below\r\n\r\n* Originally the test was using `PowerMock.expectPrivate` to mock protected fields. There is no equivalent for mockito so instead we just subclassed `KafkaBasedLog` with `MockedKafkaBasedLog` and override the fields to be returned.\r\n* ~~The test was using `Whitebox.<Thread>getInternalState(store, \"thread\")` to access an internal private `thread` field. Similarly mockito has no such method so instead I resorted to using `FieldUtils` from Apache commons whos implementation was abstracted away into a `getStorePrivateThread()` method. I had to also add an exclusion rule to `checkstyle/import-control.xml` for this new import.~~ `Thread` is now package private so no reflection is used.\r\n* Some tests had a `throw Exception` even though they never threw an exception so this was removed.","created_at":"2022-10-24T12:34:43Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T14:24:11Z","closed_at":"2023-08-07T14:24:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c9689258bb5d393997e61802cf2981051c5c032","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

in Kafka we have a global import-control.xml that is used for both main source code and tests. This change move test related allow import rules from import-control.xml to import-control-test.xml so that one cannot accidentally use test imports in the main Kafka source code.\r\n\r\nNote that `import-control-test.xml` is a carbon copy of the current `import-test.xml` with `<disallow pkg=\"kafka\" />` removed since we are dealing with tests. There are valid arguments that `import-control-test.xml` doesn't need to be so strict with import rules since it only applies for tests and it also adds a bit of friction when one needs to modify an import rule (will need to add it both to `import-control.xml` and

KRaft metadata snapshot generation between the broker and the controller, so that it all flows through the MetadataImage#write code path.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the broker generated MetadataImage objects inside BrokerMetadataListener, and published them to a single publisher, named BrokerMetadataPublisher. Now, with this PR, MetadataImage objects are loaded by the MetadataLoader, a generic metadata class shared between controller and broker. The image objects are now published to a list of publishers, rather than just to a single publisher.  Also, publishers can also be dynamically added and removed. On the broker side, we use the dynamic addition and removal to only add BrokerMetadataPublisher when our metadata has \"caught up\" to the controller's.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, snapshot generation for both the controller and the broker is handled by a metadata publisher named SnapshotGenerator. This replaces BrokerMetadataSnapshotter and the controller's SnapshotGenerator. This means that the code for generating snapshots from the controller data structures can be deleted and we can maintain only one code path here. The new SnapshotGenerator implements time-based snapshotting as specified by KIP-876.\r\n\r\nUsing the aforementioned image publisher framework, this PR adds support for dynamic configuration\r\nto the controller. Currently, only socket server, authorizer, and metrics reporter reconfiguration\r\nis supported, but more will be added in the future.\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes how we handle changing the metadata version in MetadataDelta and MetadataImage. Previously, we called handleMetadataVersionChange on all delta objects whenever we encountered a metadata change in the log. This approach was difficult to maintain, however, since changing metadata versions can add or remove fields from both deltas and images. In practice, we did not correctly implement version changes, which is why we had to disable KRaft downgrades in the 3.3 release. The new approach here is to perform an image save and load cycle. That way we only have to maintain one code path for upgrades and downgrades, in MetadataImage#write. Because doing a save and load cycle is somewhat out of scope for MetadataDelta itself, it simply throws a MetadataVersionChangedException and lets the MetadataLoader handle the change.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, this PR removes offset and epoch tracking from MetadataDelta. This tracking is done by external classes (such as MetadataLoader) so it doesn't need to be done in MetadataDelta. It also introduces a builder for MetadataDelta so that we can add new constructor parameters more easily in the future. (The only new parameter here is MetadataVersion.) Finally, there is a new class, MetadataProvenance, which encompasses offset, epoch, and timestamp, which identifies the source (provenance) of all MetadataImages.","created_at":"2022-10-20T18:40:37Z","updated_at":"2024-11-12T03:31:18Z","closed_at":"2023-04-12T17:36:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"017709027ca70b53f97ef6899895c7a93ca71cb1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12776/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12776/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12776/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/486f062f23f7f57e09eac05efb36b2aea3e779c4","head":{"label":"cmccabe:ak-image4","ref":"ak-image4","sha":"486f062f23f7f57e09eac05efb36b2aea3e779c4","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

stores are initialized from the `StreamThread` even when the state updater thread is enabled. \r\nHowever, we were missing the corresponding handling of exceptions when thrown directly during \r\nthe initialization. In particular, `TaskCorruptedException`  would directly fall through to `runLoop`, and\r\n the task would fall out of bookkeeping, since the exception is thrown when neither the \r\n`StreamThread` nor the `StateUpdater` is owning the task.\r\n\r\nThis change is validated by a unit test. We will add an integration test once the code path is stable.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and

time based snapshot for the controller. The general strategy for this feature is that the controller will use the record-batch's append time to determine if a snapshot should be generated. If the oldest record that has been committed but is not included in the latest snapshot is older than `metadata.log.max.snapshot.interval.ms`, the controller will trigger a snapshot immediately. This is useful in case the controller was offline for more that `metadata.log.max.snapshot.interval.ms` milliseconds.\r\n\r\nIf the oldest record that has been committed but is not included in the latest snapshot is NOT older than `metadata.log.max.snapshot.interval.ms`, the controller will schedule a `maybeGenerateSnapshot` deferred task.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that when the controller wants to generate a new snapshot, either because of time or number of bytes, the controller is currently generating a snapshot. In this case the `SnapshotGeneratorManager` was changed so that it checks and potentially triggers another snapshot when the currently in-progress snapshot finishes.\r\n\r\nTo better support this feature the following additional changes were made:\r\n1. The configuration `metadata.log.max.snapshot.interval.ms` was added to `KafkaConfig` with a default value of one hour.\r\n2. `RaftClient` was extended to return the latest snapshot id. This snapshot id is used to determine if a given record is included in a snapshot.\r\n3. Improve the `SnapshotReason` type to support the inclusion of values in the message.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

change allows foreign key joins to run in the streams upgrade system test. The FK join testing code was originally introduced in #12122 but wasn't executed,\r\n\r\n1) In `streams.py`, a version check was performed against `KAFKA_STREAMS_VERSION` which would sometimes fail because `KAFKA_STREAMS_VERSION` is the empty string when testing the current snapshot.\r\n\r\n2) FK join code was only added in the `StreamsUpgradeTest` of the `upgrade-system-test-*` grade modules, but not it the main `streams` grade module, which is required for testing the current snapshot. \r\n\r\nThe effect was that FK join upgrades were not tested at all.\r\n\r\nWe introduce `extra_properties` in the system tests, that can be used to pass any property to the upgrade driver, which is supposed to be reused by system tests for switching on and off flags (e.g. for the state restoration code).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify

need to break the existing fetcher into three separated classes due to the async nature of the new implementation. Here we have:\r\n1. A sender: FetchSender lives in the background thread. It examines the current buffer and sends fetches accordingly. It is completely autonomous, which means, it will not piggyback on the poll()\r\n2. A request handler: Once send requests are completed successfully, it will enqueue an event to the BackgroundEventQueue. Polling thread's poll() will poll that event off the queue and handle it like the current fetcher\r\n3. A buffer: It records the completed fetches and the next inline fetch.
