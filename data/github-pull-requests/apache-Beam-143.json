test was failing because there was an outstanding split request that was queued in the FnApiControlClient(https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/f7b23ec69fa68f4f0b6386ecec32ab12982e4098/runners/java-fn-execution/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/fnexecution/control/FnApiControlClient.java#L134) which if all outstanding responses haven't returned will throw an error which causes the test to fail because of this exception being unexpected. This should also fix the progress test since it could also see this issue.\r\n\r\nDuring the investigation of the test failure, I also discovered that BeamFnDataSizeBasedBufferingOutboundObserver was throwing an exception if close was called multiple times which is against the contract for CloseableFnDataReceiver and the CountingFnDataReceiver to only increment the count after the delegate accepted the value.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

In the previous version (1st commit) it succeeded on my AWS account. But when I try to run the same pipelines on localstack I get com.amazonaws.services.kinesis.producer.UserRecordFailedException.\r\n\r\nStrange thing is that with below code I can use the container, so it works.\r\n```\r\n client.put_record(\r\n      StreamName='beam',\r\n      Data=b'bytes',\r\n      PartitionKey='a',\r\n)\r\nshard_iterator = client.get_shard_iterator(\r\n    StreamName=self.stream_name,\r\n    ShardId='shardId-000000000000',\r\n    ShardIteratorType='TRIM_HORIZON'\r\n)\r\n\r\nresponse = client.get_records(\r\n      ShardIterator=shard_iterator['ShardIterator'],\r\n      Limit=2\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

reporting of metrics can be a best of effort (such as on dataflow), the actual metric result can be slightly different than the configured number. For example, on dataflow, if the metrics are reported but work item commit failed, some metric updates can be counted twice leading to a small difference to occur.\r\n\r\nThe finish condition is loosened a little bit to reduce the flakiness.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

total number of nullability issues in `:sdks:java:core` is very high.

While not discovering any latent NPE this time, it did uncover improvements to the core SDK:\r\n\r\n - inlining completely trivial functions and their trivial tests\r\n - moving to Java function instead of Guava function\r\n - moving to Java streams instead of Guava `FluentIterable`\r\n - moving irrelevant null check out of utility function that has no reason to accept null parameters\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

ZetaSQL planner uses `BeamZetaSqlCalcRel` by default, the Java function implementation is needed only if the user opted out of `BeamZetaSqlCalcRel`. Therefore it makes sense to move the Java implementation code to its own sub-module.\r\n\r\nAlso refactor the code base:\r\n- Delete `ZetaSqlIdUtils` which is not used\r\n- Move files only used in the ZetaSQL => Calcite translation to the `translation` sub-directory, including `SqlOperators`, `Sql*OperatorRewriter`, `SqlWindowTableFunction`\r\n- Move the allowlist in `SqlStdOperatorMappingTable` to a new file `SupportedZetaSqlBuiltinFunctions` (used only by `SqlAnalyzer`); and move the rest of the file into `translation` sub-directory (used only in translation)\r\n\r\n@apilloud \r\n@ibzib (I

PR adds a load test for evaluating the performance of the runtime typechecking system for the Python SDK. It works by comparing the performance of a pipeline with the runtime typechecking feature on versus the same pipeline with it off. This load test also allows the user to specify whether the pipeline should be run with simple typehints (e.g. str) or complex, nested typehints (e.g. Tuple[str, int, Iterable[bool]].\r\n\r\nThis PR is ready for review.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

ago when we were on Guava 21.0 there was a bug in `ClassPath` but we could not upgrade Guava so we forked `ClassPath` from Guava's `master` to get the bugfix. Because of that, the reflection underlying `ApiSurface` was not upgraded with our vendored Guava and did not work with Java 11. Un-forking `Classpath` made it work and then adjusting to ignore some new javac-added annotations was simple.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

pipeline with an empty flatten results in a bundle with no root transforms.\r\nIn Java, this caused no transform runners to be instantiated, including the\r\ndata output channels which must be executed (as they are\r\nresponsible for closing the logical data channels in finish).\r\n\r\nThis is fixed by unconditionally creating the data ouput transforms. (This is\r\nOK as processing a given transform is idempotent.)\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`LocalFileSystemsTest` relied on `System.setProperty(\"user.dir\")` to set the working directory for file resolution, to simulate a user trying to resolve and stage files relative to where they launch their pipeline.\r\n\r\nSetting `System.setProperty(\"user.dir\")` was never intended to work, but it worked by luck up to and including Java 8. In Java 11 is no longer works. There is no replacement, short of launching a subprocess with a different working directory.\r\n\r\nWe can get adequate test coverage by calling package-private helper methods.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n- This change makes sure that GH actions only run in apache/beam by default, not in forks.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, there's no way to disable the actual trigger of an action based on the repository right now. Hence, I added if-checks per job. \r\n\r\nTested manually on my fork master: \r\n- [Actual change](https://github.com/emilymye/beam/actions/runs/164928025) (with `repository_head = 'apache'`)\r\n- [An opt-in workflow](https://github.com/emilymye/beam/actions/runs/164944287) (with `repository_head = 'emilymye'`)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
