changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Mypy Release Notes</h1>\n<h2>Next release</h2>\n<h2>Mypy 1.13</h2>\n<p>We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.13 to the Python Package Index (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mypy/\">PyPI</a>).\nMypy is a static type checker for Python. You can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that unlike typical releases, Mypy 1.13 does not have any changes to type checking semantics\nfrom 1.12.1.</p>\n<h3>Improved performance</h3>\n<p>Mypy 1.13 contains several performance improvements. Users can expect mypy to be 5-20% faster.\nIn environments with long search paths (such as environments using many editable installs), mypy\ncan be significantly faster, e.g. 2.2x faster in the use case targeted by these improvements.</p>\n<p>Mypy 1.13 allows use of the <code>orjson</code> library for handling the cache instead of the stdlib <code>json</code>,\nfor improved performance. You can ensure the presence of <code>orjson</code> using the <code>faster-cache</code> extra:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy[faster-cache]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Mypy may depend on <code>orjson</code> by default in the future.</p>\n<p>These improvements were contributed by Shantanu.</p>\n<p>List of changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Significantly speed up file handling error paths (Shantanu, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17920\">17920</a>)</li>\n<li>Use fast path in modulefinder more often (Shantanu, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17950\">17950</a>)</li>\n<li>Let mypyc optimise os.path.join (Shantanu, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17949\">17949</a>)</li>\n<li>Make is_sub_path faster (Shantanu, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17962\">17962</a>)</li>\n<li>Speed up stubs suggestions (Shantanu, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17965\">17965</a>)</li>\n<li>Use sha1 for hashing (Shantanu, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17953\">17953</a>)</li>\n<li>Use orjson instead of json, when available (Shantanu, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17955\">17955</a>)</li>\n<li>Add faster-cache extra, test in CI (Shantanu, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17978\">17978</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to all mypy contributors who contributed to this release:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shantanu Jain</li>\n<li>Jukka Lehtosalo</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mypy 1.12</h2>\n<p>We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.12 to the Python Package Index (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mypy/\">PyPI</a>).

href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mypy/\">PyPI</a>). Mypy is a static type\nchecker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.\nYou can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h3>Support Python 3.12 Syntax for Generics (PEP 695)</h3>\n<p>Support for the new type parameter syntax introduced in Python 3.12 is now enabled by default,\ndocumented, and no longer experimental. It was available through a feature flag in\nmypy 1.11 as an experimental feature.</p>\n<p>This example demonstrates the new syntax:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code># Generic function\ndef f[T](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/x: T) -&gt; T: ...\n<p>reveal_type(f(1))  # Revealed type is 'int'</p>\n<h1>Generic class</h1>\n<p>class C[T]:\ndef <strong>init</strong>(self, x: T) -&gt; None:\nself.x = x</p>\n<p>c = C('a')\nreveal_type(c.x)  # Revealed type is 'str'</p>\n<h1>Type alias</h1>\n<p>type A[T] = C[list[T]]\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>For more information, refer to the <a href=\"https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generics.html\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>These improvements are included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Document Python 3.12 type parameter syntax (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17816\">17816</a>)</li>\n<li>Further documentation updates (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17826\">17826</a>)</li>\n<li>Allow Self return types with contravariance (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17786\">17786</a>)</li>\n<li>Enable new type parameter syntax by default (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17798\">17798</a>)</li>\n<li>Generate error if new-style type alias used as base class (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17789\">17789</a>)</li>\n<li>Inherit variance if base class has explicit variance (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/17787\">17787</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

3.8 and PyPy 3.8.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: a final wildcard match/case clause assigning to a name (<code>case _ as value</code>) was incorrectly marked as a missing branch.  This is now fixed,\nclosing <code>issue 1860</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fewer things are considered branches now. Lambdas, comprehensions, and\ngenerator expressions are no longer marked as missing branches if they don't\ncomplete execution.  Closes <code>issue 1852</code>_.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: the HTML report didn't properly show multi-line f-strings that end with\na backslash continuation.  This is now fixed, closing <code>issue 1836</code><em>, thanks\nto <code>LiuYinCarl and Marco Ricci &lt;pull 1838_&gt;</code></em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix: the LCOV report now has correct line numbers (fixing <code>issue 1846</code><em><code>) and better branch descriptions for BRDA records (fixing </code>issue 1850<code>_).  There are other changes to lcov also, including a new configuration option :ref:</code>line_checksums <!-- raw HTML omitted --><code> to control whether line checksums are included in the lcov report.

href=\"https://github.com/pypa/pyproject-hooks/blob/main/docs/changelog.rst\">pyproject-hooks's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\n<h2>v1.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve interoperability with <code>importlib.metadata</code>, fixing a regression\nin setuptools compatibility in 1.1 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/pyproject-hooks/issues/199\">#199</a>).</li>\n<li>Clean up the <code>_in_process</code> directory inside the package from <code>sys.path</code>\nbefore imporing the backend (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/pyproject-hooks/issues/193\">#193</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add type annotations to the public API.</li>\n<li>More careful handling of the <code>backend-path</code> key from <code>pyproject.toml</code>.\nPrevious versions would load the backend and then check that it was loaded\nfrom the specified path; the new version only loads it from the specified path.\nThe <code>BackendInvalid</code> exception is now a synonym for :exc:<code>BackendUnavailable</code>,\nand code should move to using the latter name.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Rename package to <code>pyproject_hooks</code> (from <code>pep517</code>).</li>\n<li>Remove deprecated modules (<code>.build</code>, <code>.check</code> and <code>.envbuild</code>).\nUse the <code>build &lt;https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&gt;</code>_ project\ninstead for this higher-level functionality of setting up a temporary build\nenvironment.</li>\n<li>Require Python 3.7 or above.</li>\n<li>Use <code>tomllib</code> from the standard library on Python 3.11. <code>pyproject_hooks</code>\nnow has no external dependencies when installed in Python 3.11.</li>\n<li>Avoid chaining exceptions when using the fallback implementation for\n:meth:<code>.prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel</code>.</li>\n<li>Fix propagating error message for :exc:<code>.BackendInvalid</code> errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v0.13</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove support for end-of-life Pythons. Now requires Python3.6+.</li>\n<li>Remove support for <code>toml</code> package. Now requires <code>tomli</code>.</li>\n<li>Rely on preferred &quot;files&quot; API on Python 3.9 and later (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pypa/pyproject-hooks/issues/140\">#140</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v0.12</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add method for pip to check if build_editable hook is supported.\nThis is a private API for now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>v0.11.1</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
