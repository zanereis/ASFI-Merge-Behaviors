What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n[HUDI-2671] When there are two sink workers running, there can be a case where one participant joins after the coordinator starts a first commit, which needs to be rolled back later since the other participant does not receive the START_COMMIT message for the transaction.  In this case, later on in a new commit, `writeRecords()` can miss records because `ongoingTransactionInfo.getLastWrittenKafkaOffset()` is behind the record offsets in the buffer.  This causes missing records in the target Hudi table.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by not accepting kafka offsets that are above the current expected value, and resets the kafka offset when such situation happens.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an option to run async compaction and clustering jobs without providing the instant time, using the earliest instant of the corresponding requested action by default, to improve usability.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds an API in `HoodieTimeline` to find the first instant of a specific action and state.\r\n- For `HoodieClusteringJob`, when `execute` mode is used, if the instant time is not provided from `--instant-time`, the job automatically finds the earliest scheduled clustering instant for execution.\r\n- For  `HoodieCompactor`, when executing compaction, if the instant time is not provided from `--instant-time`, the job automatically finds the earliest scheduled compaction instant for execution.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests in `TestHoodieDeltaStreamer#testHoodieAsyncClusteringJob`.\r\nThe change has also been verified by running `HoodieCompactor` and `HoodieClusteringJob` with kafka-connect:\r\n- Compaction scheduled, run `HoodieCompactor`, earliest requested compaction instant is executed.\r\n- Compaction done, run `HoodieCompactor`, throws an exception.\r\n- Clustering scheduled, run `HoodieClusteringJob`, earliest requested clustering instant is executed.\r\n- Clustering done, run `HoodieClusteringJob`, throws an exception.\r\n\r\nAsync compaction command:\r\n```\r\nspark-submit  \\\r\n--class org.apache.hudi.utilities.HoodieCompactor

Fixed the rollback planning phase to take an explicit argument on this regard and honor the same. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed rollback scheduling/planning to take an explicit argument for the rollback strategy to use instead of relying on writeConfig values. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n- Flipped to rollback based marker strategy in one of the tests which involves restore. Without the fix, the test fails and now it succeeds. \r\nTestHoodieClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage#testUpserts\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes,

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nInLineFS doesn't work with S3 logs. First, the S3 path derived from the InLineFS converted input log path is missing proper scheme separator leading to S3 log file reading issues. Then there was a NPE during the insert/update/query paths. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bug a HoodieLogFormatReader which was preventing the inline read for subsequent data blocks after the first one\r\n* Fixed the NPE when processing data blocks\r\n* Making InLineFS URI format same as other non LocalFileSystem URIs\r\n* Enhanced the unit tests for inline fs format checks\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Fixing parsing of metadadata table compaction timestamp. Metadata table compaction and cleaning has special format and needs fixing when metrics are enabled. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed parsing of the metadata table compaction/cleaning instant. Fix is to trim the last 3 chars and treat it as sec granularity similar to other commit timestamps. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Added tests to TestHoodieActiveTimeline.\r\n  - Also enabled metrics for one of large test in TestHoodieBackedMetadata which triggers compaction and exercises the fixed code path. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAdding virtual keys support for Metadata table\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Metadata table today has virtual keys disabled, thereby populating the metafields\r\n  for each record written out and increasing the overall storage space used. Hereby\r\n  adding virtual keys support for metadata table so that metafields are disabled\r\n  for metadata table records.\r\n\r\n- HFile data blocks written out and read back assume the record key and partition\r\n  path metafields are always available. After turning on the virtual keys, since\r\n  these metafields are not available, added support for HFile/Avro data block\r\n  readers, scanners to look at the table set record key property instead of the\r\n  hardcoded metafield record key.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nwe might have to re-think enabling timeline server based marker as default.\r\nincase of structured streaming, once the source stream completes, it shuts down the timeline server. and so some writes to hudi fails while creating the markers (timeline server based). I need to understand this flow better, whether we need to fix the structured streaming or its an inherent constraint.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3950 is a pre-requisite to land this PR. If not, I might have to do duplicate test fixes. So, will first land https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3950 and then will attempt at fixing the remaining test failures. I did go through once pass already. Except for structured streaming, I don't see any other major issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves a critical with Hudi concurrent writes feature, which has been described in more detail in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2641. To fix this, instead of deleting all the heartbeats of all inflight commits, we will just delete the heartbeat of those instants actually selected to be rolled back (instants truly considered as failed writes).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThe change was tested on EMR 6.4.0 on which the issue exists. If I have multiple writers ingesting data into different partitions concurrently, one of the writers would ultimately trigger the rollback of other inflight writers.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAvoid ArithmeticException from ExternalSpillableMap put operations.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- ExternalSpillableMap does the payload/value size estimation on the first put to\r\n  determine when to spill over to disk map. The payload size re-estimation also\r\n  happens after a minimum threshold of puts. This size re-estimation goes my the\r\n  current in-memory map size for calculating average payload size and does attempts\r\n  divide by zero operation when the map is size is empty. Avoiding the\r\n  ArithmeticException during the payload size re-estimate by checking the map size\r\n  upfront.\r\n\r\n- Added an unit test to repro the case and exercise the fix.\r\n\r\n## Verify

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nsupport hilbert curve for hudi.\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- This change added tests in `TestHilbertCurveUtils`, `TestZOrderingUtil`, and `TestTableLayoutOptimization` for the Z-Ordering and Hilbert Curve.\r\n\r\n- Performance evaluation of Hilbert Curve comparing to Z-Ordering:\r\n\r\nstep1: prepare a parquet table wich has 136666612

++ Seq(scala.util.Random.nextInt(1000000), scala.util.Random.nextInt(1000000)))\r\n}\r\nspark.createDataFrame(rdd, xs)\r\ncol1, col2 are produced by scala.util.Random.nextInt(1000000)\r\n\r\nstep2: bulk insert a new hudi table\r\n\r\nstep3: do optimize the hudi table by sort col1,col2 with z-order/hilbert\r\n\r\nstep4: select count(*) from htest where id1 > 500000 and id2 > 500000;\r\n--executor-cores 3 --num-executors 2 --executor-memory 8g\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor table table_z_sort_byMap with query filter: c1_int = 500000 or c2_int = 500000 we can achieve skipping percent 0.785\r\nfor table table_z_sort_bySample with query filter: c1_int = 500000 or c2_int = 500000 we can achieve skipping percent 0.76\r\nfor table table_hilbert_sort_byMap with query filter: c1_int =

effect.\r\nand use sample-optimize-strategy has a better optimization effect than use default optimize strategy.\r\nhowever As more and more columns participate in sorting, Hilbert will be slower and slower.\r\n\r\n- Locally, run the following commands to trigger clustering with Hilbert Curve in Spark Shell to make sure that there is no dependency issue with Hudi Spark bundle:\r\n```\r\nspark-2.4.8-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-shell \\\r\n  --driver-memory 4g \\\r\n  --executor-memory 1g \\\r\n  --conf spark.ui.port=5555 \\\r\n  --conf spark.driver.maxResultSize=1g

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Enabling marker based rollback as default rollback strategy\r\n- Fixed all tests where explicit rollback is being done as we can't go with marker based rollback. \r\n- Looks like restore needs some fix. Have created a tracked ticket [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2753). This patch can't be merged unless this ticket is fixed. Or we can fix restore tests to explicitly use list based rollback strategy in this patch which I prefer to avoid. \r\n- Except for few restore related tests, rest all looks good. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Lets say there is a partially failed commit which added a new partition (which is not present in table prior to this commit). next write, will rollback this failed commit. When fetching partition list we check against TableFileSystemView which will hit metadata table which may not return the new partition, but just older partitions. listing files is directly done using fs and so is not an issue. To illustrate, for eg, Commit 1 and commit2 added data to partition p1 and p2. and then commit3 added data to partition p1, p2 and p3, but failed midway. so, issue happens during rollback of commit3. \r\n- Have fixed the issue and added a test case that fails if not for the fix. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- fixed listing of partitions in List based rollback helper to use file system based listing instead of metadata based listing. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- TestHoodieBackedMetadata#testRollbackOfPartiallyFailedCommitWithNewPartitions\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n1. refactor `CreateHoodieTableCommand`;\r\n2. use `TBLPROPERTIES` syntax to pass config instead of `OPTIONS`, and sync hudi's config to properties of the table rather other properties of the storage of the table in hive metastore, also keep compatible with `OPTIONS` syntax;\r\n3. force to provide `PrimaryKey`, so that make Update/Delete available;\r\n4. hudi spark-sql decouple from metastore as far as possible, get config from local hoodie.properties first;\r\n5. modify operation and related configs when insert/merge, to make consistent with dataframe api.\r\n6. add parameter validation for recordKey, preCombineKey, keyGenerator, even if those parameters are defined by different keys.\r\n\r\n## Brief change

Adding parquet data block with inline read support.\r\n- Added a config hoodie.table.log.block.type to determine the log block type. If not set, we will fallback to determining log block type based on base file format. if set, we will use the config value.\r\n- Added some minimal tests to ensure adding a parquet data block and reading it using AbstractLogRecordScanner works fine.\r\n\r\nPending items:\r\n- where to store the configs for parquet data block (we need bloom filter configs, and parquet write configs here). Don't think we can reuse existing index config as its purpose is different.  I am thinking of HoodieStorageConfig. Once have consensus, will have to fix the configs for the same. Also, none of LogDataBlock takes in any configs for now. Will have to write in the right configs once I figure out where to store these.   \r\n- Added only inline read support in this patch. Wanted to understand if we need to support the non-inline way (read entire content and then deserialize records). \r\n- Add more end to end tests to test parquet data blocks. \r\n\r\n## Verify this

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n`spark.sql.parquet.writeLegacyFormat` was harcoded to false in `HoodieRowParquetWriteSupport`. In some cases, users need to set it to true. From a user on Slack:\r\n```\r\nReason to use this config:\r\nCurrent Bulk insert use spark dataframe writer and don't do avro conversion. The decimal columns in my DF are written as INT32 type in parquet.\r\nThe upsert functionality which uses avro conversion is generating Fixed Length byte array for decimal types which is failing with datatype mismatch.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Make `spark.sql.parquet.writeLegacyFormat` configurable.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following

New version of this PR at https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4352\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Today, base files have bloom filter at their footers and index lookups\r\n  have to load the base file to perform any bloom lookups. Though we have\r\n  interval tree based file purging, we still end up in significant amount\r\n  of base file read for the bloom filter for the end index lookups for the\r\n  keys. This index lookup operation can be made more performant by having\r\n  all the bloom filters in a new metadata partition and doing pointed\r\n  lookups based on keys.\r\n\r\n- This PR adds the basic infrastructure for initializing the new bloom filter\r\n  metadata partition, stubs for write and read code paths\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- In single writer mode with metadata enabled, there are chances an async table service in data table could concurrently update metadata table along with another writer. So, this patch adds fix, where in, only regular writes from data table can trigger table services in metadata table. So, compaction, clustering, cleaning, rollback and restore in data table can't trigger table service(compaction, cleaning) in metadata table. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Update methods in HoodieTableMetadataWriter has been updated to take in an extra argument whether a caller is a table service or not. \r\n- commit() in HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter takes an additional argument whether to trigger table services or not. compaction, clustering, cleaning, rollback will set this arg as false while regular writes will set it to true. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Added test to TestHoodieBackedMetadata to test the change. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHudi relies on custom class shading for Hbase's KeyValue.KVComparator to\r\navoid versioning and class loading issues. There are few places which are\r\nstill using the Hbase's comparator class directly and version upgrades\r\nwould make them obsolete. Refactoring the HoodieKVComparator and making\r\nall HFile writer creation using the same shaded class.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMoved HoodieKVComparator class from HFileBootstrapIndex to a standalone\r\nclass and made all HFile creation places use this new shaded class. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is
