parameter drop to subsetting operator [. This is useful to get a Column from a DataFrame, given its name. R supports it. \n\nIn R:\n\n```\n> name <- \"Sepal_Length\"\n> class(iris[, name])\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\nCurrently, in SparkR:\n\n```\n> name <- \"Sepal_Length\"\n> class(irisDF[, name])\n[1] \"DataFrame\"\n```\n\nPrevious code returns a DataFrame, which is inconsistent with R's behavior. SparkR should return a Column instead. Currently, in order for the user to return a Column given a column name as a character variable would be through `eval(parse(x))`, where x is the string `\"irisDF$Sepal_Length\"`. That itself is pretty hacky. `SparkR:::getColumn()`is another choice, but I don't see why this method should be externalized. Instead, following R's way to do things, the proposed implementation allows this:\n\n```\n> name <- \"Sepal_Length\"\n> class(irisDF[, name, drop=T])\n[1] \"Column\"\n\n> class(irisDF[, name, drop=F])\n[1] \"DataFrame\"\n```\n\nThis is consistent with R:\n\n```\n> name <- \"Sepal_Length\"\n> class(iris[, name])\n[1] \"numeric\"\n> class(iris[, name, drop=F])\n[1]

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nEnsure that all built-in expressions can be mapped to its SQL representation if there is one (e.g. ScalaUDF doesn't have a SQL representation). The function lists are from the expression list in `FunctionRegistry`.\n\nwindow functions, grouping sets functions (`cube`, `rollup`, `grouping`, `grouping_id`), generator functions (`explode` and `json_tuple`) are covered by separate JIRA and PRs. Thus, this PR does not cover them. Except these functions, all the built-in expressions are covered. For details, see the list in `ExpressionToSQLSuite`. \n\nFixed a few issues. For example, the `prettyName` of `approx_count_distinct` is not right. The `sql` of `hash` function is not right, since the `hash` function does not accept `seed`. \n\nAdditionally, also correct the order of expressions in `FunctionRegistry` so that people are easier to find which functions are missing. \n\ncc @liancheng \n#### How was the this patch tested?\n\nAdded two test cases in LogicalPlanToSQLSuite for covering `not like` and `not in`. \n\nAdded a new test suite `ExpressionToSQLSuite` to cover the functions:\n1. misc non-aggregate functions + complex type creators + null expressions\n2. math functions\n3. aggregate functions\n4. string functions\n5. date time functions + calendar interval\n6. collection functions\n7. misc functions\n","created_at":"2016-02-22T23:37:08Z","updated_at":"2016-02-23T09:55:06Z","closed_at":"2016-02-23T06:19:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"79baa09acb740bdde31193931ceba2f91a108dbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11314/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11314/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11314/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1620378727920df24bf0950249e67dfc020f9be0","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:expressionToSQL","ref":"expressionToSQL","sha":"1620378727920df24bf0950249e67dfc020f9be0","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`scala.collection.Iterator`'s methods (e.g., map, filter) will return an `AbstractIterator` which is not Serializable. E.g.,\n\n``` Scala\nscala> val iter = Array(1, 2, 3).iterator.map(_ + 1)\niter: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator\n\nscala> println(iter.isInstanceOf[Serializable])\nfalse\n```\n\nIf we call something like `Iterator.map(...).toSeq`, it will create a `Stream` that contains a non-serializable `AbstractIterator` field and make the `Stream` be non-serializable.\n\nThis PR uses `toArray` instead of `toSeq` to fix such issue in `def createDataFrame(data: java.util.List[_], beanClass: Class[_]): DataFrame`.  \n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests.\n","created_at":"2016-02-22T22:50:07Z","updated_at":"2016-02-23T23:07:42Z","closed_at":"2016-02-23T23:04:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fec864c8a4edb30f4ee3f91b633ac11d69e5a888","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11313/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11313/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11313/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/07a88b5f45028c5460fee0ea679095e589feea6e","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-13390","ref":"SPARK-13390","sha":"07a88b5f45028c5460fee0ea679095e589feea6e","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4a91806a45a48432c3ea4c2aaa553177952673e9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRemove old deprecated ThreadPoolExecutor and replace with ExecutionContext using a ForkJoinPool. The downside of this is that scala's ForkJoinPool doesn't give us a way to specify the thread pool name. One other implicit change that happens is the old ExecutionContext would have reported a different default parallelism since it used system parallelism rather than threadpool parallelism (this was likely not intended but also likely not a huge difference).\n\nThe previous version of this PR attempted to use an execution context constructed on the ThreadPool (but not the deprecated ThreadPoolExecutor class) so as to keep the ability to have human readable named threads but this reported system parallelism.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nunit tests: streaming/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis Pull request is used for the fix SPARK-12941, creating a data type mapping to Oracle for the corresponding data type\"Stringtype\" from dataframe. This PR is for the master branch fix, where as another PR is already tested with the branch 1.4\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\nThis patch was tested using the Oracle docker .Created a new integration suite for the same.The oracle.jdbc jar was to be downloaded from the maven repository.Since there was no jdbc jar available in the maven repository, the jar was downloaded from oracle site manually and installed in the local; thus tested. So, for SparkQA test case run, the ojdbc jar might be manually placed in the local maven repository(com/oracle/ojdbc6/11.2.0.2.0) while Spark QA test run.\n","created_at":"2016-02-22T18:08:51Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T06:54:03Z","closed_at":"2016-02-26T06:54:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22a8da2b00f6bcac60c770e2d4755f1e2b9c3a15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3f0f3b8105b358f580b6225f9cf1592b44e17450","head":{"label":"thomastechs:master","ref":"master","sha":"3f0f3b8105b358f580b6225f9cf1592b44e17450","user":{"login":"thomastechs","id":2070810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2070810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs","html_url":"https://github.com/thomastechs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48816612,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODgxNjYxMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"thomastechs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thomastechs","id":2070810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzA4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2070810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs","html_url":"https://github.com/thomastechs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomastechs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thomastechs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds the source file name and line into a comment of a Java code generated by Catalyst. It would be helpful to quickly identify the original source file from a position where an error occurs during a problem determination of a customer. It supports only DataFrame and SQL.\n\nThis PR consists of three parts:\n- add line information to Origin\n- pass Origin from a master to executors\n- add Origin into a comment\n\nThis PR adds the information to a comment for existing operations. Other PRs will address the followings:\n- Add a comment for Dataset\n- Insert a comment for other places\n\nHere is an example. The original Java program.\n\n```\nobject Test {\n  ...\n  df.filter(\"v <= 3\")\n    .filter(\"v % 2 == 0\")\n    .show()\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nGenerated Java code\n\n```\n...\n/* 031 */   protected void processNext() throws java.io.IOException {\n/* 032 */     while (input.hasNext()) {\n/* 033 */       InternalRow inputadapter_row = (InternalRow) input.next();\n/* 034 */       /* input[0, string] @ filter at Test.scala:23 */\n/* 035 */       boolean inputadapter_isNull = inputadapter_row.isNullAt(0);\n/* 036 */       UTF8String inputadapter_value = inputadapter_isNull ? null : (inputadapter_row.getUTF8String(0));\n/* 037 */       /* input[1, int] @ filter at Test.scala:23 */\n/* 038 */       boolean inputadapter_isNull1 = inputadapter_row.isNullAt(1);\n/* 039 */       int inputadapter_value1 = inputadapter_isNull1 ? -1 : (inputadapter_row.getInt(1));\n/* 040 */       /* ((input[1, int] <= 3) && ((input[1, int] % 2) = 0)) @ filter at Test.scala:23 */\n/* 041 */       /* (input[1, int] <= 3) @ filter at Dataset1.scala:22 */\n...\n```\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nUnit test  (add a test to keep Origin during SerDe)\n","created_at":"2016-02-22T10:05:47Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T16:21:23Z","closed_at":"2017-05-16T16:21:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"692fe922f1e6572388f65fcd0daa52a94d230f1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11301/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11301/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11301/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/597b7328554e9ee97615b4992002c16ef0322355","head":{"label":"kiszk:SPARK-13432","ref":"SPARK-13432","sha":"597b7328554e9ee97615b4992002c16ef0322355","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen there exists the other operators between Sort and Aggregate, we are unable to push down the aggregate functions in `Sort` into `Aggregate`. For example, in the following query, \n\n``` SQL\nselect area, sum(product) over () as c from windowData\nwhere product > 3 group by area, product\nhaving avg(month) > 0 order by area, avg(month), product\n```\n\nThe parsed logical plan is like\n\n```\n'Sort ['area ASC,'avg('month) ASC,'product ASC], true\n+- 'Filter cast(('avg('month) > 0) as boolean)\n   +- 'Aggregate ['area,'product], [unresolvedalias('area,None),unresolvedalias('sum('product) windowspecdefinition(UnspecifiedFrame) AS c#3,None)]\n      +- 'Filter ('product > 3)\n         +- 'UnresolvedRelation `windowData`, None\n```\n\nAfter having this PR, the query can be resolved and create an alias `aggOrder#12` for the aggregated function and added into `Aggregate` and all the nodes between `Sort` and `Aggregate`. The generated analyzed plan is like:\n\n```\nProject [area#1,c#3L]\n+- Project [area#1,c#3L,aggOrder#12]\n   +- Sort [area#1 ASC,aggOrder#12 ASC,product#2 ASC], true\n      +- Project [area#1,c#3L,aggOrder#12,product#2]\n         +- Project [area#1,product#2,c#3L,c#3L,aggOrder#12]\n            +- Window [area#1,product#2,aggOrder#12], [(sum(cast(product#2 as bigint)),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) windowspecdefinition(ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS c#3L]\n               +- Project [area#1,product#2,aggOrder#12]\n                  +- Filter havingCondition#10: boolean\n                     +- Aggregate [area#1,product#2], [cast(((avg(cast(month#0 as bigint)),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) > cast(0 as double)) as boolean) AS havingCondition#10,area#1,product#2,(avg(cast(month#0 as bigint)),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) AS aggOrder#12]\n                        +- Filter (product#2 > 3)\n                           +- Subquery windowdata\n                              +- LogicalRDD [month#0,area#1,product#2], MapPartitionsRDD[1] at apply at Transformer.scala:22\n```\n#### How was the this patch tested?\n\nTurn on a test case that `test(\"window function: Pushing aggregate Expressions in Sort to Aggregate\")` exposes this issue.\n","created_at":"2016-02-22T04:13:49Z","updated_at":"2016-08-22T04:42:03Z","closed_at":"2016-08-22T04:42:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11298/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11298/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11298/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50071e2cf9c76fd1919c437500b82bfd287b5f95","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:aggExprInSortBy","ref":"aggExprInSortBy","sha":"50071e2cf9c76fd1919c437500b82bfd287b5f95","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSupport queries that JOIN tables with USING clause.\nSELECT \\* from table1 JOIN table2 USING <column_list>\n\nUSING clause can be used as a means to simplify the join condition\nwhen :\n\n1) Equijoin semantics is desired and\n2) The column names in the equijoin have the same name.\n\nWe already have the support for Natural Join in Spark. This PR makes\nuse of the already existing infrastructure for natural join to \nform the join condition and also the projection list.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nHave added unit tests in SQLQuerySuite, CatalystQlSuite, ResolveNaturalJoinSuite\n","created_at":"2016-02-22T03:46:21Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T17:11:44Z","closed_at":"2016-03-17T17:03:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c486b415b774b5856d48c697fe854a3be0d06d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11297/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11297/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11297/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29a4f59dcdbe24666a5ff2905f50895d6232bf2d","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:spark-13427","ref":"spark-13427","sha":"29a4f59dcdbe24666a5ff2905f50895d6232bf2d","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nImprove the testing of the `EnsureRequirements` planner rule. This is a Work-in-Progress. The PR currently only consolidates a number of existing tests, and moves a few which should be in the `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange` package. The plan is to create a test matrix to test every possible combination of the following dimensions:\n- Distributions & Partitions\n  - UnspecifiedDistribution\n  - AllTuples\n  - ClusteredDistribution\n    - Partial clustered distribution\n  - OrderedDistribution\n  - BroadcastDistribution\n- The number of partitions.\n- Sorting\n  - Partial ordering\n### How was the this patch tested?\n\nThis is a test-only

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a step towards merging `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`. A new internal Catalog API was introduced in #10982 and extended in #11069. This patch introduces an implementation of this API using `HiveClient`, an existing interface to Hive. It also extends `HiveClient` with additional calls to Hive that are needed to complete the catalog implementation.\n\n_Where should I start reviewing?_ The new catalog introduced is `HiveCatalog`. This class is relatively simple because it just calls `HiveClientImpl`, where most of the new logic is. I would not start with `HiveClient`, `HiveQl`, or `HiveMetastoreCatalog`, which are modified mainly because of a refactor.\n\n_Why is this patch so big?_ I had to refactor HiveClient to remove an intermediate representation of databases, tables, partitions etc. After this refactor `CatalogTable` convert directly to and from `HiveTable` (etc.). Otherwise we would have to first convert `CatalogTable` to the intermediate representation and then convert that to HiveTable, which is messy.\n\nThe new class hierarchy is as follows:\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.Catalog\n  - org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.InMemoryCatalog\n  - org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveCatalog\n```\n\nNote that, as of this patch, none of these classes are currently used anywhere yet. This will come in the future before the Spark 2.0 release.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nAll existing unit tests, and HiveCatalogSuite that extends CatalogTestCases.\n","created_at":"2016-02-21T20:56:35Z","updated_at":"2020-12-12T11:45:36Z","closed_at":"2016-02-21T23:02:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c01ee8754d2e563e5e6482eca9a4f59c7ef001ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11293/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11293/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11293/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6703aa5af0c5bcb428bd0789aedbbec68f4257d0","head":{"label":"rxin:hive-catalog","ref":"hive-catalog","sha":"6703aa5af0c5bcb428bd0789aedbbec68f4257d0","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

tests.\n","created_at":"2016-02-21T18:10:18Z","updated_at":"2016-03-03T19:02:23Z","closed_at":"2016-03-03T09:55:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46eaae9d5a111f80b4c0fe68f104957a0651fdcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11292/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11292/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11292/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e8d4e74522f1a11fc9fd07f53cbc6298a73df889","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-13423","ref":"SPARK-13423","sha":"e8d4e74522f1a11fc9fd07f53cbc6298a73df889","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is for supporting SQL generation for cube, rollup and grouping sets.\n\nFor example, a query using rollup:\n\n``` SQL\nSELECT count(*) as cnt, key % 5, grouping_id() FROM t1 GROUP BY key % 5 WITH ROLLUP\n```\n\nOriginal logical plan:\n\n```\n  Aggregate [(key#17L % cast(5 as bigint))#47L,grouping__id#46],\n            [(count(1),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) AS cnt#43L,\n             (key#17L % cast(5 as bigint))#47L AS _c1#45L,\n             grouping__id#46 AS _c2#44]\n  +- Expand [List(key#17L, value#18, (key#17L % cast(5 as bigint))#47L, 0),\n             List(key#17L, value#18, null, 1)],\n            [key#17L,value#18,(key#17L % cast(5 as bigint))#47L,grouping__id#46]\n     +- Project [key#17L,\n                 value#18,\n                 (key#17L % cast(5 as bigint)) AS (key#17L % cast(5 as bigint))#47L]\n        +- Subquery t1\n           +- Relation[key#17L,value#18] ParquetRelation\n```\n\nConverted SQL:\n\n``` SQL\n  SELECT count( 1) AS `cnt`,\n         (`t1`.`key` % CAST(5 AS BIGINT)),\n         grouping_id() AS `_c2`\n  FROM `default`.`t1`\n  GROUP BY (`t1`.`key` % CAST(5 AS BIGINT))\n  GROUPING SETS (((`t1`.`key` % CAST(5 AS BIGINT))), ())\n```\n#### How was the this patch tested?\n\nAdded eight test cases in `LogicalPlanToSQLSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-02-20T15:35:56Z","updated_at":"2016-03-05T14:40:37Z","closed_at":"2016-03-05T11:26:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e78d8b930793aaff4c1d93687b7a12280fea7f83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11283/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11283/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11283/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/385c0d9c0acce936b8f567613f747ccc7fcdcaff","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:groupingSetsToSQL","ref":"groupingSetsToSQL","sha":"385c0d9c0acce936b8f567613f747ccc7fcdcaff","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

testing\n","created_at":"2016-02-19T23:59:53Z","updated_at":"2016-02-20T21:00:29Z","closed_at":"2016-02-20T21:00:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58ddca10b9013c541015f3d49804994c34d8ed1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9563ebf1c7c15853fe1cedb71560ed1467598c15","head":{"label":"tnachen:multiple_cluster_dispatchers","ref":"multiple_cluster_dispatchers","sha":"9563ebf1c7c15853fe1cedb71560ed1467598c15","user":{"login":"tnachen","id":67244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen","html_url":"https://github.com/tnachen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21994538,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTk5NDUzOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"tnachen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tnachen","id":67244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen","html_url":"https://github.com/tnachen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnachen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tnachen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`JobWaiter.taskSucceeded` will be called for each task. When `resultHandler` throws an exception, `taskSucceeded` will also throw it for each task. DAGScheduler just catches it and reports it like this:\n\n``` Scala\n                  try {\n                    job.listener.taskSucceeded(rt.outputId, event.result)\n                  } catch {\n                    case e: Exception =>\n                      // TODO: Perhaps we want to mark the resultStage as failed?\n                      job.listener.jobFailed(new SparkDriverExecutionException(e))\n                  }\n```\n\nTherefore `JobWaiter.jobFailed` may be called multiple times.\n\nSo `JobWaiter.jobFailed` should use `Promise.tryFailure` instead of `Promise.failure` because the latter one doesn't support calling multiple times.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds equality operators to UDT classes so that they can be correctly tested for dataType equality during union operations.\n\nThis was previously causing `\"AnalysisException: u\"unresolved operator 'Union;\"\"` when trying to unionAll two dataframes with UDT columns as below.\n\n```\nfrom pyspark.sql.tests import PythonOnlyPoint, PythonOnlyUDT\nfrom pyspark.sql import types\n\nschema = types.StructType([types.StructField(\"point\", PythonOnlyUDT(), True)])\n\na = sqlCtx.createDataFrame([[PythonOnlyPoint(1.0, 2.0)]], schema)\nb = sqlCtx.createDataFrame([[PythonOnlyPoint(3.0, 4.0)]], schema)\n\nc = a.unionAll(b)\n```\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nTested using two unit tests in sql/test.py and the DataFrameSuite. \n\nAdditional information here :

there may be still some QueryTerminated events in the listener bus queue. Then when `event ordering` starts to run, it may see these events and throw the above exception.\n\nThis PR just added `waitUntilEmpty` in `after` to make sure all events be consumed after each test.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR change the way how we generate the code for the output variables passing from a plan to it's parent.\n\nRight now, they are generated before call consume() of it's parent. It's not efficient, if the parent is a Filter or Join, which could filter out most the rows, the time to access some of the columns that are not used by the Filter or Join are wasted.\n\nThis PR try to improve this by defering the access of columns until they are actually used by a plan. After this PR, a plan does not need to generate code to evaluate the variables for output, just passing the ExprCode to its parent by `consume()`. In `parent.consumeChild()`, it will check the output from child and `usedInputs`, generate the code for those columns that is part of `usedInputs` before calling `doConsume()`.\n\nThis PR also change the `if` from \n\n```\nif (cond) {\n  xxx\n}\n```\n\nto \n\n```\nif (!cond) continue;\nxxx\n```\n\nThe new one could help to reduce the nested indents for multiple levels of Filter and BroadcastHashJoin.\n\nIt also added some comments for operators.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests. Manually ran TPCDS Q55, this PR improve the performance about 30% (scale=10, from 2.56s to 1.96s)\n","created_at":"2016-02-19T18:01:46Z","updated_at":"2018-08-02T01:38:39Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T04:10:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8f2742b78016a883740ed54d070bb340c51dc36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11274/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11274/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11274/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4311709dd0c66add99aeb248acdc70863fba239","head":{"label":"davies:gen_defer","ref":"gen_defer","sha":"f4311709dd0c66add99aeb248acdc70863fba239","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

Problem description:\n\nMesos shuffle service is completely unusable since Spark 1.6.0 . The problem seems to occur since the move from akka to netty in the networking layer. Until now, a connection from the driver to each shuffle service was used as a signal for the shuffle service to determine, whether the driver is still running. Since 1.6.0, this connection is closed after spark.shuffle.io.connectionTimeout (or spark.network.timeout if the former is not set) due to it being idle. The shuffle service interprets this as a signal that the driver has stopped, despite the driver still being alive. Thus, shuffle files are deleted before the application has stopped.\n### Context and analysis:\n\nspark shuffle fails with mesos after 2mins: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12583\nExternal shuffle service broken w/ Mesos: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13159\n\nThis is a follow up on #11207 .\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds a heartbeat signal from the Driver (in MesosExternalShuffleClient) to all registered external mesos shuffle service instances. In MesosExternalShuffleBlockHandler, a thread periodically checks whether a driver has timed out and cleans an application's shuffle files if this is the case.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nThis patch has been tested on a small mesos test cluster using the spark-shell. Log output from mesos shuffle service:\n\n```\n16/02/19 15:13:45 INFO mesos.MesosExternalShuffleBlockHandler: Received registration request from app 294def07-3249-4e0f-8d71-bf8c83c58a50-0018 (remote address /xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:52391, heartbeat timeout 120000 ms).\n16/02/19 15:13:47 INFO shuffle.ExternalShuffleBlockResolver: Registered executor AppExecId{appId=294def07-3249-4e0f-8d71-bf8c83c58a50-0018, execId=3} with ExecutorShuffleInfo{localDirs=[/foo/blockmgr-c84c0697-a3f9-4f61-9c64-4d3ee227c047], subDirsPerLocalDir=64, shuffleManager=sort}\n16/02/19 15:13:47 INFO shuffle.ExternalShuffleBlockResolver: Registered executor AppExecId{appId=294def07-3249-4e0f-8d71-bf8c83c58a50-0018, execId=7} with ExecutorShuffleInfo{localDirs=[/foo/blockmgr-bf46497a-de80-47b9-88f9-563123b59e03], subDirsPerLocalDir=64, shuffleManager=sort}\n16/02/19 15:16:02 INFO mesos.MesosExternalShuffleBlockHandler: Application 294def07-3249-4e0f-8d71-bf8c83c58a50-0018 timed out.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8000\nThis PR adds the support for detecting data source by extension and \"magic number\" in Parquet for `read().load()`.\n\nAs I described in comments, detection follows the steps below:\n\n> Detection steps follows:\n> 1. Firstly, this tries to check if one of the given paths has the extension. If it has,\n>    it detects data source based on that.\n> 2. If the path does not have an extension, then it tries to find a single leaf file from\n>    the gien path and then it tries to find an extension. If it has, it detects data source\n>    based on that.\n> 3. If this even fails, then it tries to read Parquet \"magic number\" to decide.\n\nEach test has been added for each datasource.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nThis was tested with unittests and with `dev/run_tests` for coding style\n","created_at":"2016-02-19T10:21:07Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T01:30:23Z","closed_at":"2016-03-18T06:21:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9af7de6694b109b67a9401ad9f2fb1c590f1692","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11270/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11270/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11270/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d2a1ecfd61b79b9f598b6b8c6150f95b42a7b107","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-8000","ref":"SPARK-8000","sha":"d2a1ecfd61b79b9f598b6b8c6150f95b42a7b107","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe previously hardcoded max 4 retries per stage is not suitable for all cluster configurations. Since spark retries a stage at the sign of the first fetch failure, you can easily end up with many stage retries to discover all the failures. In particular, two scenarios this value should change are (1) if there are more than 4 executors per node; in that case, it may take 4 retries to discover the problem with each executor on the node and (2) during cluster maintenance on large clusters, where multiple machines are serviced at once, but you also cannot afford total cluster downtime. By making this value configurable, cluster managers can tune this value to something more appropriate to their cluster configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nunit

#7080 we implemented disable feature scaling by penalizing each component differently. But if users train model without penalizing(set `regParam = 0.0`), `LogisticRegression` with `standardization = false` will run the same route as `standardization = true` which is incorrect. This PR will fix this issue.\n\nWe can check the test case `binary logistic regression without intercept without regularization`.\nBefore this fix, it will converged after 16 iterations  for both `standardization = true` and `standardization = false`(Because they run the same code route).\nAfter this fix, it will converged after 16 iterations for  `standardization = true` and 14 iterations for  `standardization = false`.\n\n`LinearRegression` may have the same issue. If this is accepted, I can send another PR to fix that.\n\ncc @dbtsai @mengxr @holdenk

patch refactors the KinesisUtils and adds new APIs such that it is\neasy to pass more configuration options into the KCL, such as using a\ndifferent DynamoDBClient with a different endpoint.\n\nThe core of this refactoring/change is to introduce the `KinesisConfig`\nclass which is intended to encapsulate all configuration concerns.\nCurrently, it doesn't do much more than allow for setting the DynamoDB\nendpoint, but it is a good place for where other options could be\ncontained without changing underlying APIs. It could also be inherited\nto override behavior for more options without requiring any API changes\n(such as overriding `buildKCLConfig` ti allow for more configuration\nchanges)\n\nThis also introduce a new external API for creating a KinesisRDD, which\ntakes a `KinesisConfig` object which may be a more manageable API going\nforward.\n\nDocs are still lacking for the new class as well as some basic

patch has the new logic from #8512 that uses a parallel collection to compute partitions in UnionRDD. The rest of #8512 added an alternative code path for calculating splits in S3, but that isn't necessary to get the same speedup. The underlying problem wasn't that bulk listing wasn't used, it was that an extra FileStatus was retrieved for each file. The fix was just committed as [HADOOP-12810](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12810). (I think the original commit also used a single prefix to enumerate all paths, but that isn't always helpful and it was removed in later versions so there is no need for SparkS3Utils.)\n\nI tested this using the same table that @piapiaozhexiu was using. Calculating splits for a 10-day period took 25 seconds with this change and HADOOP-12810, which is on par with the results from

dynamic resource allocation is enabled fetching broadcast variables from removed executors were causing job failures and SPARK-9591 fixed this problem by trying all locations of a block before giving up. However, the locations of a block is retrieved only once from the driver in this process and the locations in this list can be stale due to dynamic resource allocation. This situation gets worse when running on a large cluster as the size of this location list can be in the order of several hundreds out of which there may be tens of stale entries. What we have observed is with the default settings of 3 max retries and 5s between retries (that's 15s per location) the time it takes to read a broadcast variable can be as high as ~17m (70 failed attempts \\*

and `randn` functions with a `seed` argument are commonly used. Based on the common sense, the results of `rand` and `randn` should be deterministic if the `seed` parameter value is provided. For example, in MS SQL Server, it also has a function `rand`. Regarding the parameter `seed`, the description is like: `Seed is an integer expression (tinyint, smallint, or int) that gives the seed value. If seed is not specified, the SQL Server Database Engine assigns a seed value at random. For a specified seed value, the result returned is always the same.`\n\nUpdate: the current implementation is unable to generate deterministic results when the partitions are not fixed. This PR documents this issue in the function descriptions.\n\n@jkbradley hit an issue and provided an example in the following JIRA:

expects preprocessed vertex RDD as input. We call it in LDA without validating this requirement. So it might introduce errors. Replacing it by `Graph.apply` would be safer and more proper because it is a public API. The tests still pass. So maybe it is safe to use `fromExistingRDDs` here (though it doesn't seem so based on the implementation) or the test cases are special. @jkbradley @ankurdave
