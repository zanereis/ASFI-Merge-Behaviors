Guys,\r\n\r\nI tried to ingest parquet into Druid with version 0.9.2 and the latest master, but I got the following error:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"error\": \"Instantiation of [simple type, class io.druid.indexing.common.task.HadoopIndexTask] value failed: segmentOutputPath must be absent\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter removing the `segmentOutputPath` I get:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"error\": \"Instantiation of [simple type, class io.druid.indexing.common.task.HadoopIndexTask] value failed: workingPath must be absent\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter removing the `workingPath` tag I get the following:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"error\": \"Instantiation of [simple type, class io.druid.indexing.common.task.HadoopIndexTask] value failed: metadataUpdateSpec must be absent\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I remove the `metadataUpdateSpec` everything works fine and the indexing job gets kicked off via the overlord. I found it was a bit confusing to have an example with a standalone jvm, so I rewrote the page a bit so it will also carries an example json that can be posted to the overlord. Also I can imagine that it is a bit daunting for people to piggyback your postgres credentials with the job.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFokko","created_at":"2017-02-24T14:14:00Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:04Z","closed_at":"2017-03-01T22:24:36Z","merged_at":"2017-03-01T22:24:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"add17fa7dba7c96b8e079954974977043e2c73cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

- Metrics which Druid emits for each individual query is a sensitive area. If a lot of queries are done, emitting more metrics or adding dimensions to existing metrics could exhaust the capacity of the system which consumes the metrics of the Druid cluster (Graphite, or another smaller Druid cluster, etc.). Or it could simply be too expensive to store a lot of (unused) metrics data.\r\n\r\n - Evolution of metrics (changing dimension names, time unit of emitted time metrics, etc.) is hard or impossible, because existing users may depend on the specific dimension names, and expect specific time units of time metrics in their monitoring systems. In fact, it is a part of the Druid's public interface.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n`QueryMetrics` is an interface which abstracts accumulating dimensions in `ServiceMetricEvent.Builder` and emitting to `ServiceEmitter`. There are separate methods for each dimension added and metric emitted. Custom implementations of `QueryMetrics` may drop unused dimensions or skip emitting unused metrics by overriding corresponding methods with empty bodies. `QueryMetrics` also allows to control the actual dimension and metric names, and precision (time units) of the metric values. See Javadoc for `QueryMetrics` for more details.\r\n\r\nThere are specializations for topN, groupBy and timeseries queries: `TopNQueryMetrics`, `GroupByQueryMetrics` and `TimeseriesQueryMetrics`. More query types could have specialized versions of `QueryMetrics`, if needed.\r\n\r\nGeneric `QueryMetrics` and specializations are injected using `QueryMetricsFactory` in `QueryToolChestModule`.\r\n\r\n**Evolution of metrics**\r\nDruid core may add hooks for adding more dimensions to existing query metrics and emitting more metrics (i. e. add more methods to `QueryMetrics` interface or one of it's specializations), but _leave the bodies of those methods empty_ in the default implementations of `QueryMetrics`, to ensure that when users update Druid they don't suddenly have more unexpected metrics. Those users who need those additional dimensions or metrics implement their custom `QueryMetrics` and `QueryMetricsFactory` and inject them in their private Druid extension.\r\n\r\nWhen more methods are added to the `QueryMetrics` interface in future releases, the build of private extensions (custom `QueryMetrics` impls) is broken, because of unimplemented methods. It forces the user to resolve this problem manually and handle all new potential dimensions and metrics emitted in the Druid core.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nA part of

default\r\ndruid.announcer.skipSegmentAnnouncementOnZk=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm keeping those undocumented for now. We will use them on our big internal clusters first before asking users to use.\r\n\r\nchanges -\r\nAll nodes, that serve segments e.g. historicals and realtime indexing tasks, provide a \"/druid-internal/v1/segments\" HTTP endpoint that can incrementally provide the list of segments being served by that node, this uses Async IO so jetty threads are not held waiting. To power this endpoint, following method is added to DataSegmentAnnouncer interface.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Returns Future that lists the segment load/drop requests since given counter.\r\n   */\r\n  public ListenableFuture<SegmentChangeRequestsSnapshot> getSegmentChangesSince(SegmentChangeRequestHistory.Counter counter);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn coordinator/brokers side, HttpServerInventoryView class is introduced which is equivalent to BatchServerInventoryView but syncs the segment inventory using the mentioned HTTP endpoint. Server discovery\r\nis still done via zookeeper. ServerInventoryView is made an interface and its old contents are moved to AbstractCuratorServerInventoryView

patch adds a context flag to the GroupBy query that enables result limiting/sorting at the merge buffer level, allowing the brokers to process less data.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by using a min-max heap with a size limit in the BufferGrouper instead of a list of offsets.\r\n\r\nThe table buffer in the BufferGrouper is used differently in push down mode: instead of growing as buckets are added, the hash table buffer is split in half. When a half fills, the active table buffer swaps to the other half, and the top N buckets are copied over to the new active buffer.\r\n\r\nNote that when the sorting order uses fields that are not in the grouping key, limit push down can result in approximate

first.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Old Description] --\r\nI don't remember if we explicitly decided to not package the contrib extensions. But, it gives user pain to use contrib extensions because they are not bundled.\r\n\r\nI think distinction of expectations for core vs contrib extensions is well explained in the doc and also present in package names. but, it should be possible to use any extension without much effort.\r\n\r\nthat said, if community believes they should not be packaged by default then I can change this patch to add an extra profile that packages everything and can be used by users wanting that.\r\n\r\nthis patch also adds \"sqlserver-metadata-storage\" to top level pom so that it is built/tested like other extensions. it was probably missed earlier.","created_at":"2017-01-20T20:59:50Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:58Z","closed_at":"2017-02-06T21:13:02Z","merged_at":"2017-02-06T21:13:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c49a545175ece61205f1345fac24c8b3bc01f5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/21/labels","id":1831000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTgzMTAwMA==","number":21,"title":"0.10.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":310,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-15T22:35:58Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T17:41:02Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-05-16T22:41:20Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3870/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3870/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3870/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/84890ad11825cc4f1f1aeefc2f94ab90be7b218d","head":{"label":"himanshug:release_all_ext","ref":"release_all_ext","sha":"84890ad11825cc4f1f1aeefc2f94ab90be7b218d","user":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23076411,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzA3NjQxMQ==","name":"druid","full_name":"himanshug/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug/druid","description":"RealÂ²time
