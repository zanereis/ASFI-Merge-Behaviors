Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis addresses #4101 and adds `io_priority` labels in a number of places that they weren't previously set before. It also introduces the `system` `io_priority` for internal database operations.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\nI also took the opportunity to add a few utility functions for setting `io_priority` values, abstracting over the use of the process dictionary for storing these values. We could also update the existing places where `io_priority` is set to use the new functions, but that might be better in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\nNormal test suite should suffice.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has

Overview\r\n\r\nWhen smoosh is checking for compaction files to restore active compaction jobs, it uses the wrong file path. Currently, it looks for `<ShardPath>.{compact, compact.data, compact.meta}` instead of the correct `<ShardPath>.couch.{compact, compact.data, compact.meta}`.\r\n\r\n## Testing

Overview\r\n\r\nThere are three bugs that are fixed in this PR:\r\n\r\n1. When smoosh is checking for compaction files to restore active compaction jobs, it uses the wrong file path. Currently, it looks for `<ShardPath>.{compact, compact.data, compact.meta}` instead of the correct `<ShardPath>.couch.{compact, compact.data, compact.meta}`.\r\n2. Persistence and recovery of view compaction jobs was never intended. This PR adds a check to skip the process for view compaction jobs.\r\n3. There is a subtle race condition where smoosh attempts to open a deleted db when remonitoring the compaction job. This PR adds a check to not remonitor compaction jobs for deleted db files.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a toggle to enable and disable smoosh persistence has been added.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=smoosh\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nAdd smoosh queue persistence: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3766\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR

Overview\r\n\r\nThere are three bugs that are fixed in this PR:\r\n\r\n1. When smoosh is checking for compaction files to restore active compaction jobs, it uses the wrong file path. Currently, it looks for `<ShardPath>.{compact, compact.data, compact.meta}` instead of the correct `<ShardPath>.couch.{compact, compact.data, compact.meta}`.\r\n2. Persistence and recovery of view compaction jobs was never intended. This PR adds a check to skip the process for view compaction jobs.\r\n3. There is a subtle race condition where smoosh attempts to open a deleted db when remonitoring the compaction job. This PR adds a check to not remonitor compaction jobs for deleted db files.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n`make eunit apps=smoosh`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nAdd smoosh queue persistence: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3766\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable

option replicates only the winning revisions from the source to the target, effectively discarding conflicts.\r\n\r\nThis option may be used as an alternative to the custom VDU strategy, or manual _all_docs read and POST to target scripts, often used by users to discard conflicted document revisions.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes the implementation simply switches the `_changes` feed style to `main_only` from the replication default of `all_docs`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when enabled, the `winning_revs_only` option, will generate a different replication ID and use a different set of checkpoints than the default case. This should allows first replicating with `winning_revs_only: true`, and then later replicate normally between the same endpoints, in order to \"backfill\" the rest of the revisions.\r\n\r\nThe main test is in the couch_replicator_many_leaves since we already assert how multiple conflicting docs replicate there. The test was also simplified to remove the `{remote, remote}` tuple as we only have remote endpoints currently.\r\n\r\nIssue:

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently, no error is written to logs when smoosh fails to write its state to the filesystem. This PR writes the error to the logs.\r\nNote: We do not want smoosh to crash with an error since failing to persist the queue should not interfere with smoosh operations. Furthermore, nested case statements were used because we do not wish to continue on to the next step in writing the state to the filesystem if we encounter an error.\r\n\r\n## Testing

profiling [1] a cluster acting as a replication source, noticed a lot of time spent in `couch_util:to_hex/1`. That function is used to emit revision ids amongst other things. When processing a million documents with a 1000 revisions\r\neach, it ends up in the hotpath, so to speak.\r\n\r\nRemembering that in Erlang/OTP 24 there is a new [`binary:encode_hex/1`](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/binary.html#encode_hex-1) function, decided to benchmark ours vs the OTP implementation. It turns ours is slower [2] so let's try to use the OTP one.\r\n\r\nOne difference from the OTP's version is ours emits lower case hex letters, while the OTP one emits upper case ones. \r\n\r\nAs a bonus, replaced a few calls to `couch_util:to_hex/1` wrapped in `?l2b/1` or `list_to_binary/1` with just a single call to `couch_util:to_hex_bin/1`.\r\n\r\nExisting `couch_util:to_hex/1` version, returning a list , was left as is and just calls `to_hex_bin/1` internally and converts the result to a list.\r\n\r\nThis altered the peak memory usage for the key tree stemming test so had to alter the magic constants there a bit to avoid flakiness.\r\n\r\n[1] \r\n```\r\n> ... eprof:analyze(total,[{sort, time}, {filter, [{time, 1000}, {calls, 100}]}]).\r\n\r\nFUNCTION                                                            CALLS        %      TIME  [uS / CALLS]\r\n--------                                                            -----  -------      ----  [----------]\r\n...\r\ncouch_doc:revid_to_str/1                                          1165641     1.71    402860  [      0.35]\r\ncouch_key_tree:get_key_leafs_simple/4                             1304102     1.85    435700  [      0.33]\r\nerlang:list_to_integer/2                                           873172     2.00    471140  [      0.54]\r\ngen_server:loop/7                                                   62209     2.11    496932  [      7.99]\r\ncouch_key_tree:map_simple/3                                       1829235     2.36    554429  [      0.30]\r\ncouch_util:nibble_to_hex/1                                       37334650    16.67   3917127  [      0.10]\r\ncouch_util:to_hex/1                                              19834192    34.37   8077050  [      0.41]\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------  --------  -------  --------  [----------]\r\nTotal:                                                           91072005  100.00%  23503072  [      0.26]\r\n```\r\n\r\n[2] `to_hex1/1` is the existing version and `to_hex3/1` is the OTP version.\r\n\r\n```\r\n% ~/src/erlperf/erlperf 'hex:to_hex1(<<210,90,95,232,68,185,66,248,160,33,184,103,181,221,158,96>>).'

Overview\r\n\r\n1. Change `src` to `apps` and all symlinks: In order to use the\r\nlocal plugins `rebar3 ic setup_eunit [-f]`, we need to use correct\r\numbrella project structure.\r\nSee https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/pull/2729\r\n\r\n2. Use `configure` script instead of `rebar.config.script` to download\r\ndependencies: `make eunit` will get dependency cycle error if using\r\n`rebar.config.script`\r\n\r\n3. rebar3 has no options such as `skip_deps` or `-r`, so they were removed.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n```bash\r\n./configure --spidermonkey-version 60\r\nmake\r\n./dev/run --admin=adm:pass -n 1\r\n\r\nmake dist\r\nmake check\r\nmake release\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- kahsh: https://github.com/apache/couchdb-khash/pull/12\r\n- hyper: https://github.com/apache/couchdb-hyper/pull/8\r\n-

13 is the only one which seems to work with Erlang 25.\r\n\r\nBut we can't use Elixir 13 because of a few compatibility issues so have to fix\r\nthose. One involves upgrading credo. However, as soon as credo was upgraded it\r\nnoticed a bunch of issues which also had to be fixed. Some of those were:\r\n\r\n * Enum.map + join should be Enum.map_join\r\n * Invalid module name in teardown `%___MODULE__` -> `%__MODULE__`\r\n * `Mix.Config` is deprecated, use `Config`\r\n * `db_test.ex` looks like a test module to credo, so renamed it, otherwise it has to have an .exs extension\r\n * ibrowse had to be compiled so it could be properly analysed\r\n\r\nTested on macos

seems we had forgotten to enable it and in the case a node if off-line when a clustered purge request is issued, and then re-join they won't know to process any purge requests issued to other nodes.\r\n\r\nAfter enabling it @jjrodrig had noticed that sometimes we were getting a duplicate UUID purge error thrown. That's because now there is a chance for a race between the internal replicator and the interactive request, when they both handle the exact same purge request. So, instead of throwing a duplicate UUID request, consider a duplicate purge request a no-op, that's the second commit in the PR.","created_at":"2022-06-13T21:23:26Z","updated_at":"2022-06-17T19:12:34Z","closed_at":"2022-06-17T18:48:30Z","merged_at":"2022-06-17T18:48:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"63e09832a1af0c6980fafff04b1d7082267e586b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4064/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4064/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4064/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/543051755e080dfbba308b52f2a12e8fc2bce314","head":{"label":"apache:replicate-purges","ref":"replicate-purges","sha":"543051755e080dfbba308b52f2a12e8fc2bce314","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

ancestors\" are all the leaf revisions with a position less than any of the missing revisions. Previously, for every leaf revision we potentially checked every missing revision. And with missing revisions list being sorted from smallest to largest, that meant often traversing most of the missing revisions list. In general, it meant performing `O(R * M) `operations, where `R` is the number of leaf revision, and `M` is the number of missing revisions.\r\n\r\nThe optimization is instead of comparing against every single missing revision we can compare only against the highest one. If a leaf revision is less than highest missing revision, then it is already a possible ancestor, so we can stop checking. Thus, we can go from a quadratic `O(R * M)` to an `O(R) + O(M)` complexity, which, when merging large conflicting documents could give us a nice performance boost.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-10T20:45:26Z","updated_at":"2022-06-11T18:02:27Z","closed_at":"2022-06-11T18:02:25Z","merged_at":"2022-06-11T18:02:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"53adf72f48b958c0c85756c3e83d16e60657e5d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4059/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4059/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4059/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/5b74fa4652c08ec31ac90df704bcc257df0116d6","head":{"label":"apache:optimize-possible-ancestors","ref":"optimize-possible-ancestors","sha":"5b74fa4652c08ec31ac90df704bcc257df0116d6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

function is used in the hot path of _revs_diff and _bulk_docs API calls. Those could always use a bit more optimization:\r\n  * In `_revs_diff` it's used when fetching all the FDIs to see which docs are\r\n    missing in `couch_btree:lookup/2`.\r\n\r\n  * In `_bulk_docs` it's used in the `fabric_doc_update` when finalizing the\r\n    response.\r\n\r\nUsing erlperf in #4051 noticed an at most 5x speedup from using a map instead of a dict. Since a map already falls back to a proplist for small sizes, skip the length guard.\r\n\r\nSome examples runs with 500 keys:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> f(Keys), f(Res), {Keys, Res} = Gen(500), ok.\r\n\r\n> erlperf:run(#{runner => {couch_util, reorder_results2, [Keys, Res, 100, dict]}}).\r\n2407\r\n> erlperf:run(#{runner => {couch_util, reorder_results2, [Keys, Res, 100, map]}}).\r\n11639\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing a map without the guard, which is the change in this this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> f(Keys), f(Res), {Keys, Res} = Gen(500), ok.\r\nok\r\n\r\n> erlperf:run(#{runner =>

Overview\r\n\r\nIn a JWT token it is possible to add an attribute for role claims. If the roles are presented as top-level attribute like\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"couchdb-roles\": [\r\n    \"my_role_1\",\r\n    \"my_role_2\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand setting the parameter `roles_claim_name` in the config file to \r\n```\r\n[jwt_auth]\r\nroles_claim_name = couchdb-roles\r\n```\r\nCouchDB was able to read that attributed and take over that roles.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work, if the claim roles are nested, eg:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"my\" :{\r\n    \"nested\": {\r\n       \"couchdb-roles\": [\r\n         \"my_role_1\",\r\n         \"my_role_2\"\r\n       ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo allow this and for backwards compatibility, a new config parameter `roles_claim_path` is introduced to allow nested role claims. To allow the example from above, yo can use the following syntax:\r\n```\r\n[jwt_auth]\r\nroles_claim_path = my.nested.couchdb-roles\r\n```\r\nIf `roles_claim_path` is defined, then `roles_claim_name` is ignored.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nExample JWT

`[couch_http_auth]` if no value exists.\r\n\r\nSo when the test set `[couch_http_auth] secret` it didn’t get picked up by CouchDB because the util function already found `[chttpd_auth]

Overview\r\n\r\nIssues that came up testing on windows.\r\n - nose->nose2 due to python2to3 adding code that no longer works in python 3.10 and nose1's general state.\r\n - replacing now() timestamp usages with a random variable to get around a clock miscalculation on windows causing transient 409 errors.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe normal test suite runs should catch any issues.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThese changes relate to testing of the windows glazier building process on new build systems/CI.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [X] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has

Overview\r\n\r\nUnder heavy load, fabric_update_doc workers will return `timeout` via\r\nrexi. Therefore no responses will populate the response dictionary.\r\nThis leads to `badargs` when we do `dict:fetch` for keys that do not exist.\r\nThis checks for the existence of the key and then returns undefined\r\nif it does not exist, which aligns with the same code path of when we\r\nthe number of docs < 100.\r\n\r\nIn this solution, we're masking the fact that workers failed their updates. `handle_message`\r\nis never called since no workers return. The returned `Health` value is actually `ok`. It solves\r\nthe badargs but we need to consider a correct response. I don't think 200 is correct.\r\n\r\n1) We can return `{error,...}` and also change it for < 100 docs. Possible Breaking change.\r\n2) We can return `{error,...}` for only > 100 docs. But this could lead to different results.\r\n3) We can return `{accepted...}` when Results are not empty, and `error` only when results is \r\ncompletely empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRun https://gist.github.com/nickva/bde7d3cfa8c9df0dd18700c661fec4ab\r\nwith\r\n```\r\npython stampede.py -x 100 -w 5\r\n```\r\nshould not create badargs.\r\n\r\n## Related

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nPreviously, the `skip` and `limit` parameters of GET `_all_dbs` and `_dbs_info` did not work correctly. If we have 2 _design/* docs and 2 dbs (db1, db2), and we set skip=2, it will return db1 and db2, which is incorrect. Same as the `limit`. This PR will fix it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n```\r\nmake

as seen in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3963, has a potential to consume quite a bit of memory. Replacing sets with maps helped in that case, however since stemming has a non-tail recursive section, there is a chance in future versions of Erlang to experience the same behavior again.\r\n\r\nAs a safeguard, add a memory limit test by stemming a larger conflicted rev tree while limiting the maximum process heap size. For that, use the nifty `max_heap_size` process flag, which ensures a process is killed if it starts using too much memory.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the flakiness, use a deterministic tree shape by using a hard-coded seed value and leave a decent margin of error for the memory limit.\r\n\r\nRef:
