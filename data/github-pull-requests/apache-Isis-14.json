2023)</h2>\n<p><strong>User-visible changes:</strong></p>\n<p>The new command-line argument <code>-AwarnRedundantAnnotations</code> warns about redundant annotations.  With this flag, a warning is issued if an explicitly written annotation on a type is the same as the default annotation.

would break Eclipse.</li>\n<li>BREAKING CHANGE: mapstruct users should now add a dependency to lombok-mapstruct-binding. This solves compiling modules with lombok (and mapstruct).</li>\n<li>IMPROBABLE BREAKING CHANGE: The generated hashcode has changed for classes that include both primitive fields and reference fields.</li>\n<li>FEATURE: Similar to <code>@Builder</code>, you can now configure a <code>@SuperBuilder</code>'s 'setter' prefixes via <code>@SuperBuilder(setterPrefix = &quot;set&quot;)</code> for example. We still discourage doing this. [Pull Request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/2357\">#2357</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/pull/2357\">rzwitserloot/lombok#2357</a>).</li>\n<li>FEATURE: If using <code>@Synchronized(&quot;lockVar&quot;)</code>, if <code>lockVar</code> is referring to a static field, the code lombok generates no longer causes a warning about accessing a static entity incorrectly. [Issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/678\">#678</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/678\">rzwitserloot/lombok#678</a>)</li>\n<li>FEATURE: <code>@Jacksonized</code> on a <code>@Builder</code> or <code>@SuperBuilder</code> will configure <a href=\"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson\">Jackson</a> to use this builder when deserializing. [Pull Request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/2387\">#2387</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/pull/2387\">rzwitserloot/lombok#2387</a>) thanks to <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/JanRieke\"><code>@​JanRieke</code></a></strong>. <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/Jacksonized\"><code>@​Jacksonized documentation</code></a>.</li>\n<li>FEATURE: The checkerframework support has been updated; the relevant annotations were renamed in checkerframework's APIs, lombok now generates the annotations according to their current API names.</li>\n<li>PLATFORM: Added support for compiling projects with OpenJ9 [Pull Request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/2437\">#2437</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/pull/2437\">rzwitserloot/lombok#2437</a>)</li>\n<li>PLATFORM: Improved support for recent JVM/javac versions (14 and 15) and new language features.</li>\n<li>PERFORMANCE: Several performance improvements during parsing/compilation, both using javac and Eclipse.

We discourage doing this, but if some library you use requires them, have at it.

If you pass a null reference, this would result in a message-less <code>NullPointerException</code>. Now, it results in that exception but with a useful message attached (uses the same config as <code>@NonNull</code>), or alternatively via a parameter on <code>@Singular</code>, you can choose to ignore such a call (add nothing, return immediately); this can be useful when deserializing (e.g. Jackson JSON) and JPA/Hibernate code.

Fret no more; lombok can now add nullity annotations where relevant. Set the flavour of nullity annotation you prefer in your <code>lombok.config</code>. Applies to the return value of <code>toString</code>, <code>withX</code>, chainable <code>setX</code>, static constructors, <code>build</code>, <code>builder</code>, etcetera, and the parameter of <code>equals</code>, <code>canEqual</code>, and the plural form of <code>@Singular</code> marked fields for builder classes.

[Issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/2351\">#2351</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/2351\">rzwitserloot/lombok#2351</a>)</li>\n<li>BUGFIX: <code>lombok.experimental.Wither</code> has been deprecated (it has been renamed to <code>lombok.With</code>). However, the intent is that lombok still handles the old annotation in case you haven't updated your lombok dep yet. However, only a star import on <code>lombok.experimental.*</code> worked; an explicit one would cause lombok to not generate any with method.

While semantically it didn't matter, if you use the 'add this prefix for field accesses' save action in eclipse, the save action would break. [Issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/2327\">#2327</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/2327\">rzwitserloot/lombok#2327</a>)</li>\n<li>BUGFIX: When lombok copies javadoc from fields to relevant methods, it should generate an appropriate <code>@return this</code> line if lombok copies the javadoc to a generated setter that is chainable (returns itself). It didn't do that when generating the 'setters' in a <code>@Builder</code>. Lombok also didn't generate an appropriate <code>@return</code> item for <code>@With</code> methods. The javadoc has also been updated slightly (the <code>this</code> reference in the javadoc is now rendered in a code tag).[Issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/2323\">#2323</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/2323\">rzwitserloot/lombok#2323</a>)</li>\n<li>IMPROBABLE BREAKING CHANGE: Lombok now generates qualified types (so, <code>Outer.Inner</code> instead of just <code>Inner</code>) in most type signatures that it generates; this should avoid exotic scenarios where the types lombok puts in signatures end up referring to unintended other types, which can occur if your class implements an interface that itself defines a type with the same name as one defined in your source file. I told you it was exotic. Thanks to Hunter Anderson for doing some preliminary work on this change.

General performance and other fixes.</p>\n<h2>Potentially Breaking Core Changes (if migrating from 3.8.x)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Maven Resolver transport has changed from Wagon to “native HTTP”, see <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-resolver-transport.html\">Resolver Transport guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maven 2.x was auto-injecting an ancient version of plexus-utils dependency into the plugin classpath, and Maven 3.x continued doing this to preserve backward compatibility. Starting with Maven 3.9, it does not happen anymore. This change may lead to plugin breakage. The fix for affected plugin maintainers is to explicitly declare a dependency on plexus-utils. The workaround for affected plugin users is to add this dependency to plugin dependencies until issue is fixed by the affected plugin maintainer.

href=\"https://github.com/apache/maven/releases\">maven-model-builder's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>3.9.1</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.9.1/release-notes.html\">Release Notes - Maven - Version 3.9.1\n</a></h2>\n<h2>Overview About the Changes</h2>\n<p>Regression fixes from Maven 3.9.0. General performance and other fixes.</p>\n<h2>Potentially Breaking Core Changes (if migrating from 3.8.x)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Maven Resolver transport has changed from Wagon to “native HTTP”, see <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-resolver-transport.html\">Resolver Transport guide</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maven 2.x was auto-injecting an ancient version of plexus-utils dependency into the plugin classpath, and Maven 3.x continued doing this to preserve backward compatibility. Starting with Maven 3.9, it does not happen anymore. This change may lead to plugin breakage. The fix for affected plugin maintainers is to explicitly declare a dependency on plexus-utils. The workaround for affected plugin users is to add this dependency to plugin dependencies until issue is fixed by the affected plugin maintainer. See <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-6965\">MNG-6965</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mojos are prevented to boostrap new instance of RepositorySystem (for example by using deprecated ServiceLocator), they should reuse RepositorySystem instance provided by Maven instead. See <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7471\">MNG-7471</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each line in .mvn/maven.config is now interpreted as a single argument. That is, if the file contains multiple arguments, these must now be placed on separate lines, see <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7684\">MNG-7684</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7213\">MNG-7213</a>] - StackOverflowError when version ranges are unsolvable and graph contains a cycle</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7544\">MNG-7544</a>] - MavenMetadataSource#retrieve(MetadataResolutionRequest) does not check for null when reading from project map</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7676\">MNG-7676</a>] - On Maven 3.9.0+ release, sha512 hashes have &quot;null&quot; classifier</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7677\">MNG-7677</a>] - Maven 3.9.0 is ~10% slower than 3.8.7 in large multi-module builds</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7679\">MNG-7679</a>] - [REGRESSION] Build fails when executing a single mojo without a POM</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7685\">MNG-7685</a>] - Unable to ignore certificate errors with v3.9.0</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7693\">MNG-7693</a>] - NPE in createModelCache, modelCacheFactory is null</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7697\">MNG-7697</a>] - Cannot parse POM that contains an emoji in a comment</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7708\">MNG-7708</a>] - Resolver in Maven 3.9+ no longer retries on a conection failure</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7709\">MNG-7709</a>] - plexus-utils upgrade changes the way configuration is parsed</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7710\">MNG-7710</a>] - Upgrade plexus-utils to 3.5.1</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7716\">MNG-7716</a>] - ConcurrencyDependencyGraph deadlock if no root can be selected</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7717\">MNG-7717</a>] - Maven warns wrongly about ${localRepository} expression</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7720\">MNG-7720</a>] - [REGRESSION] Build order is incorrect and does not respect Reactor Build Order</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7721\">MNG-7721</a>] - Maven 3.9 resolver ignores proxy configured via MAVEN_OPTS</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7726\">MNG-7726</a>] - Maven 3.9.0 resolves properties in file profile activation incorrectly</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7731\">MNG-7731</a>] - MNG-7520 incorrectly back ported to Maven 3.9.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-5185\">MNG-5185</a>] - Improve &quot;missing dependency&quot; error message when _maven.repositories/_remote.repositories contains other repository ids than requested</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7686\">MNG-7686</a>] - Speed up by replacing non-pattern #replaceAll() with #replace() or precompiled patterns</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7706\">MNG-7706</a>] - Deprecate ${localRepository} mojo parameter expression</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Task</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7197\">MNG-7197</a>] - Simplify exit code handling in Windows command startup script</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

2023)</h2>\n<p><strong>User-visible changes:</strong></p>\n<p>Fixed a bug in the Nullness Checker where a call to a side-effecting method did not make some formal parameters possibly-null.  The Nullness Checker is likely to issue more warnings for your code.  For ways to eliminate the new warnings, see <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#type-refinement-side-effects\">https://checkerframework.org/manual/#type-refinement-side-effects</a> .</p>\n<p>If you supply the <code>-AinvocationPreservesArgumentNullness</code> command-line option, the Nullness Checker unsoundly assumes that arguments passed to non-null parameters in an invocation remain non-null after the invocation.
