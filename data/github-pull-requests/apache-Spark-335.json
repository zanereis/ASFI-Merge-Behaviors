What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we only support aggregate buffer with simple/primitive types for `HashAggregateExec`. Ideally the buffer type should be mutable in an unsafe row, however, logicall struct type with all fixed-length fields is also mutable.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem, and we can run whole-stage codegen for aggregate function with complex buffer type.\r\n\r\nDid a micro benchmark:\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.range(100000000).select(max(struct($\"id\")))\r\ndf.explain\r\ndf.collect\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the explain result is:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nSortAggregate(key=[], functions=[max(named_struct(id, id#0L))])\r\n+- Exchange SinglePartition\r\n   +- SortAggregate(key=[], functions=[partial_max(named_struct(id, id#0L))])\r\n      +- *Range (0, 100000000, step=1, splits=Some(1))\r\n```\r\nand it costs 4800 ms\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the explain result is:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[max(named_struct(id, id#11L))],

Issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19007\r\n\r\nSpeedup and optimize the GradientBoostedTrees in the \"data>memory\" scene  by persist the RDD named predError.\r\n\r\nTest data：80G CTR training data from criteolabs(http://criteolabs.wpengine.com/downloads/download-terabyte-click-logs/ ) ,I used 1 of the 24 days' data.Some features needed to be repalced by new generated continuous features，the way to generate the new features refers to the way mentioned in the xgboost's paper.\r\n\r\nRecource allocated: spark on yarn, 20 executors, 8G memory and 2 cores per executor.\r\nI tested the GradientBoostedTrees algorithm in mllib using 80G CTR data mentioned above.\r\nIt totally costs 1.5 hour, and i found many task failures after 6 or 7 GBT rounds later.Without these task failures and task retry it can be much faster ,which can save about half the time. I think it's caused by the RDD named predError in the while loop of the boost method at GradientBoostedTrees.scala,because the lineage of the RDD named predError is growing after every GBT round, and then it caused failures like this :\r\n\r\n(ExecutorLostFailure (executor 6 exited caused by one of the running tasks) Reason: Container killed by YARN for exceeding memory limits. 10.2 GB of 10 GB physical memory used. Consider boosting spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead.).\r\n\r\nI tried to boosting spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead but the meomry it needed is too much (even increase half the memory can't solve the problem) so i think it's not a proper method.\r\n\r\nAlthough it can set the predCheckpoint Interval smaller to cut the line of the lineage but it increases IO cost a lot.\r\n\r\nI tried another way to solve this problem.I persisted the RDD named predError every round and use pre_predError to record the previous RDD and unpersist it because it's useless anymore.\r\nFinally it costs about 45 min after i tried my method and no task failure occured and no more memeory added.\r\n\r\nSo when the data is much larger than memory, my little improvement can speedup the GradientBoostedTrees 1~2 times.","created_at":"2016-12-27T07:11:25Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T00:05:22Z","closed_at":"2020-01-20T00:05:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"549557795d9676a9be5187c4abd474eec0b40ef2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16415/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16415/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16415/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11af7f1988d5667ea0674f9aaf979b751c1038d4","head":{"label":"zdh2292390:zhangdenghui_mllib_gbdt","ref":"zhangdenghui_mllib_gbdt","sha":"11af7f1988d5667ea0674f9aaf979b751c1038d4","user":{"login":"zdh2292390","id":13797111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzk3MTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13797111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390","html_url":"https://github.com/zdh2292390","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67516674,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NzUxNjY3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"zdh2292390/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zdh2292390","id":13797111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzk3MTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13797111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390","html_url":"https://github.com/zdh2292390","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zdh2292390/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zdh2292390/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr is to keep column ordering when a schema is explicitly specified.\r\nA concrete example is as follows;\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> import org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nscala> case class A(a: Long, b: Int)\r\nscala> val as = Seq(A(1, 2))\r\nscala> spark.createDataFrame(as).write.parquet(\"/Users/maropu/Desktop/data/a=1/\")\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.parquet(\"/Users/maropu/Desktop/data/\")\r\nscala> df.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- a: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- b: integer (nullable = true)\r\n\r\nscala> val schema = new StructType().add(\"a\", LongType).add(\"b\", IntegerType)\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.schema(schema).parquet(\"/Users/maropu/Desktop/data/\")\r\nscala> df.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- b: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- a: long (nullable = true)\r\n\r\n ```\r\n\r\nThis fix removes the code to filter out the overlapped fields of a data schema in `getOrInferFileFormatSchema`. Then, it respects column ordering in `HadoopFsRelation#schema`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `ParquetPartitionDiscoverySuite`.\r\nThis pr comes from

Currently, it always returns `Some(StringType)` incorrectly. Note that, for the `testH2Dialect` in `JDBCSuite`, it's intentional because of the test case `Remap types via JdbcDialects`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is a test only update.

is not allowed, because the 2 `rand()` are different(we generate random seed as the default seed for `rand()`). https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19035 is tracking this issue.\r\n\r\n## How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOn 32-bit ARM platforms, doubles require 8-byte alignment. The use of Java's `sun.misc.Unsafe` library for memory block management exposes Spark to misaligned doubles when using `org.apache.spark.unsafe.Platform.getDouble()` to extract a double from a memory block with arbitrary offset locations. For the alignment sensitive platforms, this proposed change creates an properly aligned buffer that the bytes to be cast to a double are first copied to, then the double the double is extracted via the `sun.misc.Unsafe.getDouble()` method. On all other platforms the previous behavior is maintained, which was to cast the double value from the memory block regardless of offset alignment . \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll unit tests pass, plus tested on both x86 and ARM71 platforms. For the ARM71 platform, it is verified that this fix removes the problem as described in SPARK-18819.\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-26T10:42:45Z","updated_at":"2017-01-21T17:19:59Z","closed_at":"2017-01-21T17:06:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46efca498677eb20f88b85af73ebece95cb6fc7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a5abc37b62948e95d5802a3bf91fd4f100ee442","head":{"label":"michaelkamprath:fix/SPARK-18819_double-alignment","ref":"fix/SPARK-18819_double-alignment","sha":"1a5abc37b62948e95d5802a3bf91fd4f100ee442","user":{"login":"michaelkamprath","id":124372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelkamprath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77305810,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzMwNTgxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"michaelkamprath/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"michaelkamprath","id":124372,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124372?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelkamprath","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelkamprath/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/michaelkamprath/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe add a cbo configuration to switch between default stats and estimated stats.\r\nWe also define a new statistics method `planStats` in LogicalPlan with conf as its parameter, in order to pass the cbo switch and other estimation related configurations in the future. `planStats` is used on the caller sides (i.e. in Optimizer and Strategies) to make transformation decisions based on stats.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a test case using a dummy LogicalPlan.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-26T06:20:30Z","updated_at":"2017-01-10T12:41:37Z","closed_at":"2017-01-03T04:22:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80e49ebb0b6303215c34db2fded851425a9c4019","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b01d51f182b8a2531544188d8bee147a3a7d0a47","head":{"label":"wzhfy:cboSwitch","ref":"cboSwitch","sha":"b01d51f182b8a2531544188d8bee147a3a7d0a47","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

have no effect in spark2.0.1，\r\nHive confs in hive-site.xml will be loaded in hadoopConf, so we should use hadoopConf in InsertIntoHiveTable instead of SessionState.conf\r\n\r\n----------\r\n[[SPARK-18675][SQL] CTAS for hive serde table should work for all hive versions](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16104)\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore hive 1.1, when inserting into a table, hive will create the staging directory under a common scratch directory. After the writing is finished, hive will simply empty the table directory and move the staging directory to it.\r\n\r\nAfter hive 1.1, hive will create the staging directory under the table directory, and when moving staging directory to table directory, hive will still empty the table directory, but will exclude the staging directory there.\r\n\r\nIn `InsertIntoHiveTable`, we simply copy the code from hive 1.2, which means we will always create the staging directory under the table directory, no matter what the hive version is. This causes problems if the hive version is prior to 1.1, because the staging directory will be removed by hive when hive is trying to empty the table directory.\r\n\r\nThis PR copies the code from hive 0.13, so that we have 2 branches to create staging directory. If hive version is prior to 1.1, we'll go to the old style branch(i.e. create the staging directory under a common scratch directory), else, go to the new style branch(i.e. create the staging directory under the table directory)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n[[SPARK-18703] [SQL] Drop Staging Directories and Data Files After each Insertion/CTAS of Hive serde Tables](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16134)\r\n\r\nBelow are the files/directories generated for three inserts againsts a Hive table:\r\n```\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1/-ext-10000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1/-ext-10000/._SUCCESS.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1/-ext-10000/.part-00000.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1/-ext-10000/_SUCCESS\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-29_149_4298858301766472202-1/-ext-10000/part-00000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1/-ext-10000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1/-ext-10000/._SUCCESS.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1/-ext-10000/.part-00000.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1/-ext-10000/_SUCCESS\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_454_6445008511655931341-1/-ext-10000/part-00000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1/-ext-10000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1/-ext-10000/._SUCCESS.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1/-ext-10000/.part-00000.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1/-ext-10000/_SUCCESS\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.hive-staging_hive_2016-12-03_20-56-30_722_3388423608658711001-1/-ext-10000/part-00000\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/.part-00000.crc\r\n/private/var/folders/4b/sgmfldk15js406vk7lw5llzw0000gn/T/spark-41eaa5ce-0288-471e-bba1-09cc482813ff/part-00000\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first 18 files are temporary.

This fails because it uses the paths (via `getFile`) from URLs in the tests whereas some added afterward are normal local paths.\r\n(`url.getFile` gives `/C:/a/b/c` and some paths are added later as the format of `C:\\a\\b\\c`. )\r\n\r\nSo, many classpaths are duplicated because normal local paths and paths from URLs are mixed. This length is up to 40K which hits the length limitation problem (32K) on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe full command line built here is -

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this issue is that `ExecutorAllocationListener` gets the speculated task end info after the stage end event handling which let `numRunningTasks = 0`. Then it let `numRunningTasks -= 1` so the #numRunningTasks is negative. When calculate #maxNeeded in method `maxNumExecutorsNeeded()`, the value may be 0 or negative. So `ExecutorAllocationManager` does not request container and the job will be hung.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the method `onTaskEnd()` in `ExecutorAllocationListener`. When `stageIdToNumTasks` contains the taskEnd's stageId, let #numRunningTasks minus 1.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested in the method `test(\"SPARK-18981...)` of ExecutorAllocationManagerSuite.scala.\r\nCreate two taskInfos and one of them is speculated task. After the stage ending event, the speculated task ending event is posted to listener.\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-24T02:39:54Z","updated_at":"2016-12-24T02:48:37Z","closed_at":"2016-12-24T02:48:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0bc02f14951570ca342de5b1ab7b2ad383979d98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16394/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16394/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16394/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0220aefb1689731144dafccb001860276ee8d22","head":{"label":"zhaorongsheng:branch-18981-1","ref":"branch-18981-1","sha":"c0220aefb1689731144dafccb001860276ee8d22","user":{"login":"zhaorongsheng","id":4468567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Njg1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4468567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaorongsheng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhaorongsheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaorongsheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaorongsheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaorongsheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaorongsheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaorongsheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaorongsheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaorongsheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaorongsheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhaorongsheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a848f0ba84e37fd95d0f47863ec68326e3296b33","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince `spark.sql.hive.thriftServer.singleSession` is a configuration of SQL component, this conf can be moved from `SparkConf` to `StaticSQLConf`.\r\n\r\nWhen we introduced `spark.sql.hive.thriftServer.singleSession`, all the SQL configuration are session specific. They can be modified in different sessions. \r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.1, static SQL configuration is added. It is a perfect fit for `spark.sql.hive.thriftServer.singleSession`. Previously, we did the same move for `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` from `SparkConf` to `StaticSQLConf`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this issue is that `ExecutorAllocationListener` gets the speculated task end info after the stage end event handling which let `numRunningTasks = 0`. Then it let `numRunningTasks -= 1` so the #numRunningTasks is negative. When calculate #maxNeeded in method `maxNumExecutorsNeeded()`, the value may be 0 or negative. So `ExecutorAllocationManager` does not request container and the job will be hung.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the method `onTaskEnd()` in `ExecutorAllocationListener`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf a new option `wholeFile` is set to `true` the JSON reader will parse each file (instead of a single line) as a value. This is done with Jackson streaming and it should be capable of parsing very large documents, assuming the row will fit in memory.\r\n\r\nBecause the file is not buffered in memory the corrupt record handling is also slightly different when `wholeFile` is enabled: the corrupt column will contain the filename instead of the literal JSON if there is a parsing failure. It would be easy to extend this to add the parser location (line, column and byte offsets) to the output if desired.\r\n\r\nThese changes have allowed types other than `String` to be parsed. Support for `UTF8String` and `Text` have been added (alongside `String` and `InputFormat`) and no longer require a conversion to `String` just for parsing.\r\n\r\nI've also included a few other changes that generate slightly better bytecode and (imo) make it more obvious when and where boxing is occurring in the parser.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we implement `Aggregator` with `DeclarativeAggregate`, which will serialize/deserialize the buffer object every time we process an input.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `Aggregator` with `TypedImperativeAggregate` and avoids to serialize/deserialize buffer object many times.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn current Spark we could add customized SparkListener through `SparkContext#addListener` API, but there's no equivalent API to remove the registered one. In our scenario SparkListener will be added repeatedly accordingly to the changed environment. If lacks the ability to remove listeners, there might be many registered listeners finally, this is unnecessary and potentially affects the performance. So here propose to add an API to remove registered listener.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd an unit test to verify

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now the name of threads created by Netty for Spark RPC are `shuffle-client-**` and `shuffle-server-**`. It's pretty confusing.\r\n\r\nThis PR just uses the module name in TransportConf to set the thread name. In addition, it also includes the following minor fixes:\r\n\r\n- TransportChannelHandler.channelActive and channelInactive should call the corresponding super methods.\r\n- Make ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator throw NoSuchElementException if it has no more elements. Otherwise,  if the caller calls `next` without `hasNext`, it will just hang.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDecision trees/GBT/RF do not handle edge cases such as constant features or empty features.\r\nIn the case of constant features we choose any arbitrary split instead of failing with a cryptic error message.\r\nIn the case of empty features we fail with a better error message stating:\r\nDecisionTree requires number of features > 0, but was given an empty features vector\r\nInstead of the cryptic error message:\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: empty.max\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests are added in the patch for:\r\nDecisionTreeRegressor\r\nGBTRegressor\r\nRandom Forest

For example:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE show_t1(a String, b Int) PARTITIONED BY (c String, d String);\r\nALTER TABLE show_t1 ADD PARTITION (c='Us', d=1) PARTITION (c='Us', d=22);\r\n\r\n-- Output the extended information of Partition(c='Us', d=1)\r\nSHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'show_t1' PARTITION(c='Us', d=1);\r\n-- Throw an AnalysisException\r\nSHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'show_t1' PARTITION(c='Us');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test sqls in file `show-tables.sql`.\r\nAdd new test case in `DDLSuite`.","created_at":"2016-12-21T08:39:29Z","updated_at":"2017-03-16T06:42:53Z","closed_at":"2017-03-14T17:16:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c80a74c8ba25648a1ef88dffef14ad72fc8e69a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62aee59ad44c95ffa0fc8f7895733fe9d7cf81e3","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:show-partition-extended","ref":"show-partition-extended","sha":"62aee59ad44c95ffa0fc8f7895733fe9d7cf81e3","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

backport of #16189; original description follows:\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark's current task cancellation / task killing mechanism is \"best effort\" because some tasks may not be interruptible or may not respond to their \"killed\" flags being set. If a significant fraction of a cluster's task slots are occupied by tasks that have been marked as killed but remain running then this can lead to a situation where new jobs and tasks are starved of resources that are being used by these zombie tasks.\r\n\r\nThis patch aims to address this problem by adding a \"task reaper\" mechanism to executors. At a high-level, task killing now launches a new thread which attempts to kill the task and then watches the task and periodically checks whether it has been killed. The TaskReaper will periodically re-attempt to call `TaskRunner.kill()` and will log warnings if the task keeps running. I modified TaskRunner to rename its thread at the start of the task, allowing TaskReaper to take a thread dump and filter it in order to log stacktraces from the exact task thread that we are waiting to finish. If the task has not stopped after a configurable timeout then the TaskReaper will throw an exception to trigger executor JVM death, thereby forcibly freeing any resources consumed by the zombie tasks.\r\n\r\nThis feature is flagged off by default and is controlled by four new configurations under the `spark.task.reaper.*` namespace. See the updated `configuration.md` doc for details.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested via a new test case in `JobCancellationSuite`, plus manual testing.

is a branch-2.0 backport of #16340; the original description follows:\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn order to respond to task cancellation, Spark tasks must periodically check `TaskContext.isInterrupted()`, but this check is missing on a few critical read paths used in Spark SQL, including `FileScanRDD`, `JDBCRDD`, and UnsafeSorter-based sorts. This can cause interrupted / cancelled tasks to continue running and become zombies (as also described in #16189).\r\n\r\nThis patch aims to fix this problem by adding `TaskContext.isInterrupted()` checks to these paths. Note that I could have used `InterruptibleIterator` to simply wrap a bunch of iterators but in some cases this would have an adverse performance penalty or might not be effective due to certain special uses of Iterators in Spark SQL. Instead, I inlined `InterruptibleIterator`-style logic into existing iterator subclasses.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually in `spark-shell` with two different reproductions of non-cancellable tasks, one involving scans of huge files and another involving sort-merge joins that spill to disk. Both causes of zombie tasks are fixed by the changes added here.","created_at":"2016-12-20T19:50:12Z","updated_at":"2016-12-21T23:36:31Z","closed_at":"2016-12-21T00:05:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96e08b3dd2d600db716cafce1402662903a972c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16357/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16357/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16357/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/66a83704d3b5ad8e4f2c078051ce4e635a94b25f","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:sql-task-interruption-branch-2.0","ref":"sql-task-interruption-branch-2.0","sha":"66a83704d3b5ad8e4f2c078051ce4e635a94b25f","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we only have a SQL interface for recovering all the partitions in the directory of a table and update the catalog. `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE table RECOVER PARTITIONS`. (Actually, very hard for me to remember `MSCK` and have no clue what it means)\r\n\r\nAfter the new \"Scalable Partition Handling\", the table repair becomes much more important for making visible the data in the created data source partitioned table.\r\n\r\nThus, this PR is to add it into the Catalog interface. After this PR, users can repair the table by\r\n```Scala\r\nspark.catalog.recoverPartitions(\"testTable\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified the existing test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a significant change to delay scheduling to avoid under-utilization of cluster resources when there are locality preferences for a subset of resources.  The main change here is that the delay is no longer reset when any task is scheduled at a tighter locality constraint.  Instead, each task set starts the locality timer the first time it fails to utilize a resource offer due to locality constraints.  One task set *never* tightens the locality constraints, even if subsequent offers are made that utilize tighter constraints.\r\n\r\nA more complete description of the issues w/ the previous scheduling method can be found under the jira.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test for original issue.  Ran all unit tests in o.a.s.scheduler.* manually.  Full tests via jenkins.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n* [ ] add more unit tests, especially for recompute locality levels.\r\n* [ ] code cleanup (especially all the logging added)","created_at":"2016-12-20T17:49:08Z","updated_at":"2017-04-06T18:46:25Z","closed_at":"2017-04-06T18:46:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0822c294696b2c8a612cebbb5083c12b9cc52720","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16354/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16354/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16354/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/449ba20c9c642884f5dcc5feccfa64cb1da833f2","head":{"label":"squito:delay_sched-SPARK-18886","ref":"delay_sched-SPARK-18886","sha":"449ba20c9c642884f5dcc5feccfa64cb1da833f2","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`CSVRelation.csvParser` does type dispatch for each value in each row. We can prevent this because the schema is already kept in `CSVRelation`.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR proposes that converters are created first according to the schema, and then apply them to each.\r\n\r\nI just ran some small benchmarks as below after resembling the logics in

on top of work in SPARK-8425 to update Application Level Blacklisting in the scheduler.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds a UI to these patches by:\r\n- defining new listener events for blacklisting and unblacklisting, nodes and executors;\r\n- sending said events at the relevant points in BlacklistTracker;\r\n- adding JSON (de)serialization code for these events;\r\n- augmenting the Executors UI page to show which, and how many, executors are blacklisted;\r\n- adding a unit test to make sure events are being fired;\r\n- adding HistoryServerSuite coverage to verify that the SHS reads these events correctly.\r\n- updates the Executor UI to show Blacklisted/Active/Dead as a tri-state in Executors Status\r\n\r\nUpdates .rat-excludes to pass tests.\r\n\r\n@username squito\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n./dev/run-tests\r\ntestOnly org.apache.spark.util.JsonProtocolSuite\r\ntestOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this issue is that RegisterWorkerResponse and LaunchExecutor are sent via two different channels (TCP connections) and their order is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the master and worker codes to use `workerRef` to send RegisterWorkerResponse, so that RegisterWorkerResponse and LaunchExecutor are sent via the same connection. Hence `LaunchExecutor` will always be after `RegisterWorkerResponse` and never be ignored.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins","created_at":"2016-12-19T23:54:06Z","updated_at":"2016-12-26T07:52:00Z","closed_at":"2016-12-26T07:50:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb2bb51d3a922911667de25435e91b0e8ec88bc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16345/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16345/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16345/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b4b55528edc5e9c92f28cf81ea81e72748790100","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-17755","ref":"SPARK-17755","sha":"b4b55528edc5e9c92f28cf81ea81e72748790100","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4cb49412d1d7d10ffcc738475928c7de2bc59fd4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn order to respond to task cancellation, Spark tasks must periodically check `TaskContext.isInterrupted()`, but this check is missing on a few critical read paths used in Spark SQL, including `FileScanRDD`, `JDBCRDD`, and UnsafeSorter-based sorts. This can cause interrupted / cancelled tasks to continue running and become zombies (as also described in #16189).\r\n\r\nThis patch aims to fix this problem by adding `TaskContext.isInterrupted()` checks to these paths. Note that I could have used `InterruptibleIterator` to simply wrap a bunch of iterators but in some cases this would have an adverse performance penalty or might not be effective due to certain special uses of Iterators in Spark SQL. Instead, I inlined `InterruptibleIterator`-style logic into existing iterator subclasses.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually in `spark-shell` with two different reproductions of non-cancellable tasks, one involving scans of huge files and another involving sort-merge joins that spill to disk. Both causes of zombie tasks are fixed by the changes added here.","created_at":"2016-12-19T21:40:41Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T19:47:36Z","closed_at":"2016-12-20T00:21:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f076d0cd80a5e45fb665c02121b2f38930095cbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16340/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16340/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16340/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/236efe580b52ed7ec6ce9e36f9b814147ebad99d","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:sql-task-interruption","ref":"sql-task-interruption","sha":"236efe580b52ed7ec6ce9e36f9b814147ebad99d","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

although they were, and `sortable` class does not only mark tables as sortable but also limited the width of their child `td` elements.\r\nThe reason why now some tables are not `sortable` class is because another sortable mechanism was introduced by #13620 and #13708 with pagination feature.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, I've introduced new class `table-cell-width-limited` which limits the description cell width and the description is like what it was.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1260\" alt=\"2016-12-20 1 00 34\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR extends the existing IN/NOT IN subquery test cases coverage, adds more test cases to the IN subquery test suite. \r\n\r\nBased on the discussion, we will create  `subquery/in-subquery` sub structure under `sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/inputs` directory. \r\n\r\nThis is the high level grouping for IN subquery:\r\n\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/simple-in.sql`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/in-group-by.sql (in parent side, subquery, and both)`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/not-in-group-by.sql`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/in-order-by.sql`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/in-limit.sql`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/in-having.sql`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/in-joins.sql`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/not-in-joins.sql`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/in-set-operations.sql`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/in-with-cte.sql`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/not-in-with-cte.sql`\r\nsubquery/in-subquery/in-multiple-columns.sql`\r\n\r\nWe will deliver it through multiple prs, this is the first pr for the IN subquery, it has\r\n\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/simple-in.sql`\r\n`subquery/in-subquery/in-group-by.sql (in parent side, subquery, and both)`\r\n\r\nThese are the results from running on DB2.\r\n[Modified test file of in-group-by.sql used to run on DB2](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/683367/in-group-by.sql.db2.txt)\r\n[Output of the run result on DB2](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/683362/in-group-by.sql.db2.out.txt)\r\n[Modified

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe can build Python API docs by `cd ./python/docs && make html for Python` and R API docs by `cd ./R && sh create-docs.sh for R` separately. However, `jekyll` fails in some environments.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `SKIP_PYTHONDOC` and `SKIP_RDOC` for documentation build in `docs` folder. Currently, we can use `SKIP_SCALADOC` or `SKIP_API`. The reason providing additional options is that the Spark documentation build uses a number of tools to build HTML docs and API docs in Scala, Python and R. Specifically, for Python and R,\r\n\r\n- Python API docs requires `sphinx`.\r\n- R API docs requires `R` installation and `knitr` (and more others libraries).\r\n\r\nIn other words, we cannot generate Python API docs without R installation. Also, we cannot generate R API docs without Python `sphinx` installation. If Spark provides `SKIP_PYTHONDOC` and `SKIP_RDOC` like `SKIP_SCALADOC`, it would be more convenient.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual.\r\n\r\n**Skipping Scala/Java/Python API Doc

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt's weird that we use `Hive.getDatabase` to check the existence of a database, while Hive has a `databaseExists` interface.\r\n\r\nWhat's worse, `Hive.getDatabase` will produce an error message if the database doesn't exist, which is annoying when we only want to check the database existence.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this and use `Hive.databaseExists` to check database existence.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- A separate subsection for Aggregations under “Getting Started” in the Spark SQL programming guide. It mentions which aggregate functions are predefined and how users can create their own.\r\n- Examples of using the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` abstract class for untyped aggregations in Java and Scala.\r\n- Examples of using the `Aggregator` abstract class for type-safe aggregations in Java and Scala.\r\n- Python is not covered. \r\n- The PR might not resolve the ticket since I do not know what exactly was planned by the author. \r\n\r\nIn total, there are four new standalone examples that can be executed via `spark-submit` or `run-example`. The updated Spark SQL programming guide references to these examples and does not contain hard-coded snippets. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe patch was tested locally by building the docs. The examples were run as well.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nmllib.KMeansModel.clusterCentersWithNorm is a method than ends up being called every time `predict` is called on a single vector, which is bad news for now the ml.KMeansModel Transformer works, which necessarily transforms one vector at a time.\r\n\r\nThis causes the model to just store the vectors with norms upfront. The extra norm should be small compared to the vectors. This would avoid this form of overhead on this and other code paths.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting
