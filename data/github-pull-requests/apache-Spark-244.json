for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen running CTAS/RTAS, use the nullable schema of the input query to create the table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's very likely to run CTAS/RTAS with non-nullable input query, e.g. `CREATE TABLE t AS SELECT 1`. However, it's surprising to users if they can't write null to this table later. Non-nullable is kind of a constraint of the column and should be specified by users explicitly.\r\n\r\nFor reference, Postgres also use nullable schema for CTAS:\r\n```\r\n> create table t1(i int not null);\r\n\r\n> insert into t1 values (1);\r\n\r\n> create table t2 as select i from t1;\r\n\r\n> \\d+ t1;\r\n Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage | Stats target | Description \r\n--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------+---------+--------------+-------------\r\n i      | integer |           | not null |         | plain   |              | \r\n\r\n> \\d+ t2;\r\n Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage | Stats target | Description \r\n--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------+---------+--------------+-------------\r\n i      | integer |           |          |         | plain   |              | \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFile source V1 has the same behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, after this PR CTAS/RTAS creates tables with nullable schema, then users can insert null values later.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR removes the `canonicalize(attrs: AttributeSeq)` from `PlanExpression` and taking care of normalizing expressions in `QueryPlan`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`Expression` has already a `canonicalized` method and having the `canonicalize` method in `PlanExpression` is confusing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nRemoves the `canonicalize` plan from `PlanExpression`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDocument DESCRIBE TABLE statement in SQL Reference Guide. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark lacks documentation on the supported SQL constructs causing\r\nconfusion among users who sometimes have to look at the code to understand the\r\nusage. This is aimed at addressing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\nThere was no documentation for this.\r\n\r\n**After.**\r\n<img

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor implicit cross join, we can set up a watchdog to cancel it if running for a long time.\r\nWhen \"spark.sql.crossJoin.enabled\" is false, because `CheckCartesianProducts` is implemented in logical plan stage, it may generate some mismatching error which may confuse end user:\r\n* it's done in logical phase, so we may fail queries that can be executed via broadcast join, which is very fast.\r\n* if we move the check to the physical phase, then a query may success at the beginning, and begin to fail when the table size gets larger (other people insert data to the table). This can be quite confusing.\r\n* the CROSS JOIN syntax doesn't work well if join reorder happens.\r\n* some non-equi-join will generate plan using cartesian product, but `CheckCartesianProducts` do not detect it and raise error.\r\n\r\nSo that in order to address this in simpler way, we can turn off showing this cross-join error by default.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I list some cases raising mismatching error here:\r\nProviding:\r\n```\r\nspark.range(2).createOrReplaceTempView(\"sm1\") // can be broadcast\r\nspark.range(50000000).createOrReplaceTempView(\"bg1\") // cannot be broadcast\r\nspark.range(60000000).createOrReplaceTempView(\"bg2\") // cannot be broadcast\r\n```\r\n1) Some join could be convert to broadcast nested loop join, but CheckCartesianProducts raise error. e.g.\r\n```\r\nselect sm1.id, bg1.id from bg1 join sm1 where sm1.id < bg1.id\r\n```\r\n2) Some join will run by CartesianJoin but CheckCartesianProducts DO NOT raise error. e.g.\r\n```\r\nselect bg1.id, bg2.id from bg1 join bg2 where bg1.id < bg2.id\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a listListeners() method to StreamingQueryManager that lists all StreamingQueryListeners that have been added to that manager.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhile it's best practice to keep handles on all listeners added, it's still nice to have an API to be able to list what listeners have been added to a StreamingQueryManager.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified existing unit tests to use the new API instead of using

also includes the follow-up fix by Hyukjin Kwon:\r\n[SPARK-26895][CORE][FOLLOW-UP] Uninitializing log after `prepareSubmitEnvironment` in SparkSubmit\r\n\r\n`prepareSubmitEnvironment` performs globbing that will fail in the case where a proxy user (`--proxy-user`) doesn't have permission to the file. This is a bug also with 2.3, so we should backport, as currently you can't launch an application that for instance is passing a file under `--archives`, and that file is owned by the target user.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to call `prepareSubmitEnvironment` within a doAs context if proxying.\r\n\r\nManual tests running with `--proxy-user` and `--archives`, before and after, showing that the globbing is successful when the resource is owned by the target user.\r\n\r\nI've looked at writing unit tests, but I am not sure I can do that cleanly (perhaps with a custom FileSystem).

ideas.","created_at":"2019-08-20T22:58:47Z","updated_at":"2019-08-22T18:11:43Z","closed_at":"2019-08-22T07:40:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b86c8687a33edfba695a60882728f6538584c333","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

also includes the follow-up fix by Hyukjin Kwon:\r\n[SPARK-26895][CORE][FOLLOW-UP] Uninitializing log after `prepareSubmitEnvironment` in SparkSubmit\r\n\r\n`prepareSubmitEnvironment` performs globbing that will fail in the case where a proxy user (`--proxy-user`) doesn't have permission to the file. This is a bug also with 2.3, so we should backport, as currently you can't launch an application that for instance is passing a file under `--archives`, and that file is owned by the target user.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to call `prepareSubmitEnvironment` within a doAs context if proxying.\r\n\r\nManual tests running with `--proxy-user` and `--archives`, before and after, showing that the globbing is successful when the resource is owned by the target user.\r\n\r\nI've looked at writing unit tests, but I am not sure I can do that cleanly (perhaps with a custom FileSystem).

ideas.","created_at":"2019-08-20T22:45:03Z","updated_at":"2019-08-22T18:11:43Z","closed_at":"2019-08-21T15:23:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"666ff1e32ee03c07e6b1affb0acd6cd017906015","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25516/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25516/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25516/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df9eace2c6a6d96783a083050ad58e055ad94886","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-26895-2.4","ref":"SPARK-26895-2.4","sha":"df9eace2c6a6d96783a083050ad58e055ad94886","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR allows Python toLocalIterator to prefetch the next partition while the first partition is being collected. The PR also adds a demo micro bench mark in the examples directory, we may wish to keep this or not.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23961 / 5e79ae3b40b76e3473288830ab958fc4834dcb33 we changed PySpark to only pull one partition at a time. This is memory efficient, but if partitions take time to compute this can mean we're spending more time blocking.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nA new param is added to toLocalIterator\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test inside of `test_rdd.py` checks the time that the elements are evaluated at. Another test that the results remain the same are added to `test_dataframe.py`.\r\n\r\nI also ran a micro benchmark in the examples directory `prefetch.py` which shows an improvement of ~40% in this specific use case.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> 19/08/16 17:11:36 WARN NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable\r\n> Using Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j-defaults.properties\r\n> Setting default log level to \"WARN\".\r\n> To adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter `SPARK-23966 Refactoring all checkpoint file writing logic in a common CheckpointFileManager interface`, the CheckpointFileManager interface was created to handle all structured streaming checkpointing operations and helps users to choose how they wish to write checkpointing files atomically.\r\nStreamExecution and StreamingQueryManager still uses some FileSystem operations without using the CheckpointFileManager.\r\nFor instance,\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamExecution.scala#L137\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamExecution.scala#L392\r\n\r\nInstead, StreamExecution and StreamingQueryManager should use CheckpointFileManager for these operations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change will allow users to use CheckpointFileManager for structured streaming checkpointing files without need for a separate FileSystem implementation for the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDuring graceful shutdown of ``StreamingContext`` ``graph.stop()`` is invoked right after stopping of ``timer`` which generates new job. Thus it's possible that the latest jobs generated by timer are still in the middle of generation but invocation of ``graph.stop()`` closes some objects required to job generation, e.g. consumer for Kafka, and generation fails. That also leads to fully waiting of ``spark.streaming.gracefulStopTimeout`` which is equal to 10 batch intervals by default. Stopping of the graph should be performed later, after ``haveAllBatchesBeenProcessed`` is completed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test to existing test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange the logic of collecting the indeterminate stage, we should look at stages from mapStage, not failedStage during handle FetchFailed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the fetch failed error handle logic, the original logic of collecting indeterminate stage from the fetch failed stage. And in the scenario of the fetch failed happened in the first task of this stage, this logic will cause the indeterminate stage to resubmit partially. Eventually, we are capable of getting correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nIt makes the corner case of indeterminate stage abort as expected.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT in DAGSchedulerSuite.\r\nRun below integrated test with `local-cluster[5, 2, 5120]`, and set `spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition`=false, it will abort the indeterminate stage as expected:\r\n```scala\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\nval res = spark.range(0, 10000 * 10000, 1).map{ x => (x % 1000, x)}\r\n// kill

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange the logic of collecting the indeterminate stage, we should look at stages from mapStage, not failedStage during handle FetchFailed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the fetch failed error handle logic, the original logic of collecting indeterminate stage from the fetch failed stage. And in the scenario of the fetch failed happened in the first task of this stage, this logic will cause the indeterminate stage to resubmit partially. Eventually, we are capable of getting correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nIt makes the corner case of indeterminate stage abort as expected.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT in DAGSchedulerSuite.\r\nRun below integrated test with `local-cluster[5, 2, 5120]`, and set `spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition`=false, it will abort the indeterminate stage as expected:\r\n```\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\nval res = spark.range(0, 10000 * 10000, 1).map{ x => (x % 1000, x)}\r\n// kill an

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSome newer JDKs use the tzdata2018i database, which changes how certain (obscure) historical dates and timezones are handled. As previously, we can pretty much safely ignore these in tests, as the value may vary by JDK.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTest otherwise fails using, for example, JDK 1.8.0_222. https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8215982 has a full list of JDKs which has this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of #24761 which added a higher-order function `ArrayForAll`.\r\nThe PR mistakenly removed the `prettyName` from `ArrayExists` and forgot to add it to `ArrayForAll`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis reverts the `prettyName` back to `ArrayExists` not to affect explained plans, and adds it to `ArrayForAll` to clarify the `prettyName` as the same as the expressions around.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nResolves [SPARK-28778: Shuffle jobs fail due to incorrect advertised address when running in a virtual network on Mesos](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28778).\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug which occurs when shuffle jobs are launched by Mesos in a virtual network. Mesos scheduler sets executor `--hostname` parameter to `0.0.0.0` in the case when `spark.mesos.network.name` is provided. This makes executors use `0.0.0.0` as their advertised address and, in the presence of shuffle, executors fail to fetch shuffle blocks from each other using `0.0.0.0` as the origin. When a virtual network is used the hostname or IP address is not known upfront and assigned to a container at its start time so the executor process needs to advertise the correct dynamically assigned address to be reachable by other executors.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- added a fallback to `Utils.localHostName()` in Spark Executors when `--hostname` is not provided\r\n- removed setting executor address to `0.0.0.0` from Mesos scheduler\r\n- refactored the code related to building executor command in Mesos scheduler\r\n- added network configuration support to Docker containerizer\r\n- added unit tests\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe bug described above prevents Mesos users from running any jobs which involve shuffle due to the inability of executors to fetch shuffle blocks because of incorrect advertised address when virtual network is used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- added unit test to `MesosCoarseGrainedSchedulerBackendSuite` which verifies the absence of `--hostname` parameter  when `spark.mesos.network.name` is provided and its presence otherwise\r\n- added unit test to `MesosSchedulerBackendUtilSuite` which verifies that `MesosSchedulerBackendUtil.buildContainerInfo` sets network-related properties for Docker containerizer\r\n- unit tests from this repo launched with profiles: `./build/mvn test -Pmesos -Pnetlib-lgpl -Psparkr -Phive -Phive-thriftserver`, build log attached: [mvn.test.log](https://github.com/apache/spark/files/3516891/mvn.test.log)\r\n- integration tests from [DCOS Spark repo](https://github.com/mesosphere/spark-build), more specifically - [test_spark_cni.py](https://github.com/mesosphere/spark-build/blob/master/tests/test_spark_cni.py) which runs a specific [shuffle job](https://github.com/mesosphere/spark-build/blob/master/tests/jobs/scala/src/main/scala/ShuffleApp.scala) and verifies its successful completion, Mesos task network configuration, and IP addresses for both Mesos and Docker

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen collecting the indeterminate stages for handling FetchFailed, we should look at stages from mapStage, instead of failedStage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the fetch failed error handle logic, the original logic of collecting indeterminate stage from the fetch failed stage. And in the scenario of the fetch failed happened in the first task of this stage, this logic will cause the indeterminate stage to resubmit partially. Eventually, we are capable of getting correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nIt makes the corner case of indeterminate stage abort as expected.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT in DAGSchedulerSuite.\r\nRun below integrated test with `local-cluster[5, 2, 5120]`, and set `spark.sql.execution.sortBeforeRepartition`=false, it will abort the indeterminate stage as expected:\r\n```\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\nval res = spark.range(0, 10000 * 10000, 1).map{ x => (x % 1000, x)}\r\n// kill an executor in the stage that performs repartition(239)\r\nval df = res.repartition(113).map{ x => (x._1 + 1, x._2)}.repartition(239).map { x =>\r\n  if (TaskContext.get.attemptNumber == 0 &&

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nrepr(schema) produces runnable python code\r\nschema.toString produce runnable scala code\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPreviously, schema.toString produced scala code that wasn't runnable because field-names weren't quoted.  Even worse, repr(schema) in python produced the same non-runnable scala code.  This resolves both issues, so that runnable Scala and Python are available.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

when open the application and event log is too large, and add event log split with the config spark.eventLog.cuttype\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport to cut the event log, and solve the history server was too slow when event log is too large. When the cuttype is configed, the EventLoggingListener will check the logpath, if the logpath is changed, the eventlog writer will be created when all jobs are end. And there is a write/read lock to ensure the multiprocess safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the eventlog is very large, the history server will be oom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDisable using radix sort in ShuffleExchangeExec when we do repartition.\r\nIn #20393, we fixed the indeterministic result in the shuffle repartition case by performing a local sort before repartitioning.\r\nBut for the newly added sort operation, we use radix sort which is wrong because binary data can't be compared by only the prefix. This makes the sort unstable and fails to solve the indeterminate shuffle output problem.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the correctness bug caused by repartition after a shuffle.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, user will get the right result in the case of repartition stage rerun.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest with `local-cluster[5, 2, 5120]`, use the integrated test below, it can return a right answer 100000000.\r\n```\r\nimport scala.sys.process._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\nval res =

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to set minimum and maximum Java version specification. (see https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Writing-portable-packages).\r\n\r\nSeems there is not the standard way to specify both given the documentation and other packages (see https://gist.github.com/glin/bd36cf1eb0c7f8b1f511e70e2fb20f8d).\r\n\r\nI found two ways from existing packages on CRAN.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPackage (<= 1 & > 2)\r\nPackage (<= 1, > 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latter seems closer to other standard notations such as `R (>= 2.14.0), R (>= r56550)`. So I have chosen the latter way.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSeems the package might be rejected by CRAN. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25472#issuecomment-522405742\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nJDK 8\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./build/mvn -DskipTests -Psparkr clean package\r\n./R/run-tests.sh\r\n\r\n...\r\nbasic tests for CRAN:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the leak of crc files from CheckpointFileManager when FileContextBasedCheckpointFileManager is being used.\r\n\r\nSpark hits the Hadoop bug, [HADOOP-16255](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-16255) which seems to be a long-standing issue.\r\n\r\nThis is there're two `renameInternal` methods:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void renameInternal(Path src, Path dst)\r\npublic void renameInternal(final Path src, final Path dst, boolean overwrite)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich should be overridden to handle all cases but ChecksumFs only overrides method with 2 params, so when latter is called FilterFs.renameInternal(...) is called instead, and it will do rename with RawLocalFs as underlying filesystem.\r\n\r\nThe bug is related to FileContext, so FileSystemBasedCheckpointFileManager is not affected.\r\n\r\n[SPARK-17475](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17475) took a workaround for this bug, but [SPARK-23966](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23966) seemed to bring regression.\r\n\r\nThis PR deletes crc file as \"best-effort\" when renaming, as failing to delete crc file is not that critical to fail the task.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents crc files not being cleaned up even purging batches. Too many files in same directory often hurts performance, as well as each crc file occupies more space than its own size so possible to occupy nontrivial amount of space when batches go up to 100000+.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSome unit tests are modified to check leakage of crc files.","created_at":"2019-08-18T21:44:24Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T06:47:35Z","closed_at":"2019-08-23T06:10:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c2eb0fbaadc2c80fb35b670d1312feee4ca7c67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

PR is for backporting SPARK-28647(#25374) to branch-2.4.\r\nThe original PR removed `additional-metrics.js` but branch-2.4 still uses it so I don't remove it and related things for branch-2.4.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded checkboxes to enable users to select which optional metrics (`On Heap Memory`, `Off Heap Memory` and `Select All` in this case) to be shown in `ExecuorPage`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBy SPARK-17019, `On Heap Memory` and `Off Heap Memory` are introduced as optional metrics. But they are not displayed because they are made `display: none` in css and there are no way to appear them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThe previous `ExecutorPage` doesn't show optional metrics.\r\nThis change adds checkboxes to `ExecutorPage` for optional metrics.\r\nWe can choose which metrics should be shown by checking corresponding checkboxes.\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-08-18 03-56-09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/63216148-2bfadb80-c16c-11e9-81e1-e1e66198dd6c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSimple fix of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28749\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs discussed in the referenced Jira, currently, the PySpark tests invoked by `python/run-tests` demand the presence of kafka-0-8 libraries. If not present, a failure message will be generated regardless of whether the tests are enabled by env variables. Since Kafka-0-8 libraries are not compatible with Scala-2.12, this means we can’t successfully run pyspark tests on a Scala-2.12 build.  These proposed changes fix the problem. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo. It only changes a test behavior. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is a fix of a test bug. The current behavior is demonstrably wrong under Scala-2.12, as stated above. The corrected behavior allows the tests to run to completion, with results that are consistent with the expected results, similar to the successful Scala-2.11 results.\r\n\r\nWe performed the following:\r\n- Full mvn build under Scala-2.11, with kafka-0-8 profile\r\n- Full mvn build under Scala-2.12, without kafka-0-8 profile\r\n- Full maven Unit Test of both, with no change (as expected)\r\n- PySpark tests via `python/run-tests` with both.  Both complete successfully.\r\n\r\nFormer behavior before this patch was that the last step would post a Failure on the Scala-2.12 build.\r\n\r\n### Notes for reviewers\r\nThere are of course many ways to fix the problem. I chose to follow the pattern established by the Kinesis testing routines that were right “next to” the Kafka-0-8 test routines in the same file. They showed a presumably acceptable way of dealing with missing jars. \r\n\r\nI ignored the env variable, because the presence or absence of the jar seemed a sufficient and more important determinant. But if you want me to use the env variable exactly the same way as the Kinesis testing code, I’ll be happy to do so.

environment.\r\n\r\n**JDK8**\r\n```\r\n$ cd core\r\n$ mvn -X dependency:tree -Dincludes=jakarta.activation:jakarta.activation-api\r\n...\r\n[DEBUG]       org.glassfish.jersey.core:jersey-server:jar:2.29:compile (version managed from 2.22.2)\r\n[DEBUG]          org.glassfish.jersey.media:jersey-media-jaxb:jar:2.29:compile\r\n[DEBUG]          javax.validation:validation-api:jar:2.0.1.Final:compile\r\n```\r\n\r\n**JDK11**\r\n```\r\n[DEBUG]       org.glassfish.jersey.core:jersey-server:jar:2.29:compile (version managed from 2.22.2)\r\n[DEBUG]          org.glassfish.jersey.media:jersey-media-jaxb:jar:2.29:compile\r\n[DEBUG]          javax.validation:validation-api:jar:2.0.1.Final:compile\r\n[DEBUG]          jakarta.xml.bind:jakarta.xml.bind-api:jar:2.3.2:compile\r\n[DEBUG]             jakarta.activation:jakarta.activation-api:jar:1.2.1:compile\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDo the following in both `JDK8` and `JDK11` environment. The dependency manifest should not be changed. In the current `master` branch, `JDK11` changes the dependency manifest.\r\n```\r\n$ dev/test-dependencies.sh --replace-manifest\r\n```","created_at":"2019-08-17T03:52:52Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T17:17:02Z","closed_at":"2019-08-17T17:16:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"626375d52cc3dc8f7a88ce4c1103ac0e35479623","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f24d262ea6f1384311d7feb420307ce96938577","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-28765","ref":"SPARK-28765","sha":"7f24d262ea6f1384311d7feb420307ce96938577","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c9b49f3978666af5d59a76e1cf2c23ed76f31a2d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAt the moment no end-to-end Kafka delegation token test exists which was mainly because of missing embedded KDC. KDC is missing in general from the testing side so I've discovered what kind of possibilities are there. The most obvious choice is the MiniKDC inside the Hadoop library where Apache Kerby runs in the background. What this PR contains:\r\n* Added MiniKDC as test dependency from Hadoop\r\n* Added `maven-bundle-plugin` because couple of dependencies are coming in bundle format\r\n* Added security mode to `KafkaTestUtils`. Namely start KDC -> start Zookeeper in secure mode -> start Kafka in secure mode\r\n* Added a roundtrip test (saves and reads back data from Kafka)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNo such test exists + security testing with KDC is completely missing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + additional unit tests.\r\nI've put the additional test into a loop and was consuming ~10 sec average.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-16T10:35:32Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T22:42:40Z","closed_at":"2019-08-29T18:52:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0dab6776dc893b631fce57c8a488f37cc3a431ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix both tests below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n======================================================================\r\nFAIL: test_raw_and_probability_prediction (pyspark.ml.tests.test_algorithms.MultilayerPerceptronClassifierTest)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/dongjoon/APACHE/spark-master/python/pyspark/ml/tests/test_algorithms.py\", line 89, in test_raw_and_probability_prediction\r\n    self.assertTrue(np.allclose(result.rawPrediction, expected_rawPrediction, atol=1E-4))\r\nAssertionError: False is not true\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile \"/Users/dongjoon/APACHE/spark-master/python/pyspark/mllib/clustering.py\", line 386, in __main__.GaussianMixtureModel\r\nFailed example:\r\n    abs(softPredicted[0] - 1.0) < 0.001\r\nExpected:\r\n    True\r\nGot:\r\n    False\r\n**********************************************************************\r\nFile \"/Users/dongjoon/APACHE/spark-master/python/pyspark/mllib/clustering.py\", line 388, in __main__.GaussianMixtureModel\r\nFailed example:\r\n    abs(softPredicted[1] - 0.0) < 0.001\r\nExpected:\r\n    True\r\nGot:\r\n    False\r\n```\r\n\r\nto pass in JDK 11.\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems to be different float values being understood via Py4J. This issue also was found in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25132 before.\r\n\r\nWhen floats are transferred from Python to JVM, the values are sent as are. Python floats are not \"precise\" due to its own limitation - https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html.\r\nFor some reasons, the floats from Python on JDK 8 and JDK 11 are different, which is already explicitly not guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThis seems why only some tests in PySpark with floats are being failed.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR fixes it by increasing tolerance in identified test cases in PySpark. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo fully support JDK 11. See, for instance, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25443 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25423 for ongoing efforts.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually tested as described in JIRAs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phadoop-3.2 test:package\r\n$ python/run-tests --testnames

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade `Janino` from `3.0.13` to `3.0.15` in order to bring the bug fixes. Please note that `3.1.0` is a major refactoring instead of bug fixes. We had better use `3.0.15` and wait for the stabler 3.1.x.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis brings the following bug fixes.\r\n\r\n**3.0.15 (2019-07-28)**\r\n\r\n- Fix overloaded single static method import\r\n\r\n**3.0.14 (2019-07-05)**\r\n\r\n- Conflict in sbt-assembly\r\n- Overloaded static on-demand imported methods cause a CompileException: Ambiguous static method import\r\n- Handle overloaded static on-demand imports\r\n- Major refactoring of the Java 8 and Java 9 retrofit mechanism\r\n- Added tests for \"JLS8 8.6 Instance Initializers\" and \"JLS8 8.7 Static Initializers\"\r\n- Local variables in instance initializers don't work\r\n- Provide an option to keep generated code files\r\n- Added compile error handler and warning handler to ICompiler\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with the existing tests.","created_at":"2019-08-16T08:39:56Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T18:38:04Z","closed_at":"2019-08-16T18:37:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59e59c43b29ec04087cf1fc4efec4cb96c8b0b0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25474/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25474/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25474/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0466b8d737b33b4862e296d66dc80cb23ea1b05e","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-28758","ref":"SPARK-28758","sha":"0466b8d737b33b4862e296d66dc80cb23ea1b05e","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0ea8db9fd3d882140d8fa305dd69fc94db62cf8f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR changes subquery reuse in Adaptive Query Execution from compile-time static reuse to execution-time dynamic reuse. This PR adds a `ReuseAdaptiveSubquery` rule that applies to a query stage after it is created and before it is executed. The new dynamic reuse enables subqueries to be reused across all different subquery levels.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is an improvement to the current subquery reuse in Adaptive Query Execution, which allows subquery reuse to happen in a lazy fashion as well as at different subquery levels.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPassed existing tests.","created_at":"2019-08-16T03:47:39Z","updated_at":"2019-08-20T11:58:48Z","closed_at":"2019-08-20T11:58:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"432102f027f00753e590f0143b0b914c3b026295","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c3f5518fc50ad4ea17c2bf56d683cfe0d521878","head":{"label":"maryannxue:aqe-dynamic-sub-reuse","ref":"aqe-dynamic-sub-reuse","sha":"4c3f5518fc50ad4ea17c2bf56d683cfe0d521878","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove the performance of java serializer deserialization by caching the resolved class. Java serializer is used in many places: closure, RPC and others. This change could improve the performance of deserialization 1.3X ~ 1.5X.  Especially for java primitive instances. \r\n\r\nAnd also, add new UT tests and benchmarks case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change could improve the performance of deserialization 1.3X ~ 1.5X.  Especially for java primitive instances. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAdd new config to enable disable this feature, default is true. This shouldn't influence the existed code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-16T02:19:48Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T02:41:50Z","closed_at":"2019-11-20T02:41:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"77d9d6052c87b8e65c505bb8a6c0098387cf7868","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn pr #[24533](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24533/files) , it prevent retry to a removed Executor. \r\nIn my test, I can't catch exceptions from \r\n` new OneForOneBlockFetcher(client, appId, execId, blockIds, listener,\r\n              transportConf, tempFileManager).start()`\r\nAnd I check the code carefully， method **start()** will handle exception of IOException in it's retry logical, won't throw it out. until it meet maxRetry times or meet exception that is not  IOException. \r\n\r\nAnd if we meet the situation that when we fetch block , the executor is dead, when we rerun \r\n`RetryingBlockFetcher.BlockFetchStarter.createAndStart()`\r\nwe may failed when we create a transport client to dead

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter Apache Spark 3.0.0 supports JDK11 officially, people will try JDK11 on old Spark releases (especially 2.4.4/2.3.4) in the same way because our document says `Java 8+`. We had better avoid that misleading situation.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `+` from `Java 8+` in the documentation (master/2.4/2.3). Especially, 2.4.4 release and 2.3.4 release (cc @kiszk )\r\n\r\nOn master branch, we will add JDK11 after [SPARK-24417.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24417)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

However, at that time, we don't know if the returned table will be used for read or write.\r\n\r\nWe don't have any new features or perf improvement in file source v2. The fallback API is just a safeguard if we have bugs in v2 implementations. There are not many benefits to support falling back to v1 for read and write path separately.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to merge these 2 configs into one.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe Spark SQL test framework needs to support 2 kinds of tests:\r\n1. tests inside Spark to test Spark itself (extends `SparkFunSuite`)\r\n2. test outside of Spark to test Spark applications (introduced at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/b57ed2245c705fb0964462cf4492b809ade836c6)\r\n\r\nThe class hierarchy of the major testing traits:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3182036/63088526-c0f0af80-bf87-11e9-9bed-c144c2486da9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n`PlanTestBase`, `SQLTestUtilsBase` and `SharedSparkSession` intentionally don't extend `SparkFunSuite`, so that they can be used for tests outside of Spark. Tests in Spark should extends `QueryTest` and/or `SharedSQLContext` in most cases.\r\n\r\nHowever, the name is a little confusing. As a result, some test suites extend `SharedSparkSession` instead of `SharedSQLContext`. `SharedSparkSession` doesn't work well with `SparkFunSuite` as it doesn't have the special handling of thread auditing in `SharedSQLContext`. For example, you will see a warning starting with `===== POSSIBLE THREAD LEAK IN SUITE` when you run `DataFrameSelfJoinSuite`.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to rename `SharedSparkSession` to `SharedSparkSessionBase`, and rename `SharedSQLContext` to `SharedSparkSession`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded new benchmark `ExtractBenchmark` for the `EXTRACT(field FROM source)` function.

The `cast(id as timestamp)` was taken as the `source` argument.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running the benchmark via:\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1 build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo follow ANSI SQL, we should support a configurable mode that throws exceptions when casting to integers causes overflow.\r\nThe behavior is similar to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26218, which throws exceptions on arithmetical operation overflow.\r\nTo unify it, the configuration is renamed from \"spark.sql.arithmeticOperations.failOnOverFlow\" to \"spark.sql.failOnIntegerOverFlow\"\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use `InheritableThreadLocal` instead of `ThreadLocal` for current epoch in `EpochTracker`. Python UDF needs threads to write out to and read it from Python processes and when there are new threads, previously set epoch is lost.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, Python UDFs can be used at Structured Streaming with the continuous mode.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, udf\r\nfooUDF = udf(lambda p: \"foo\")\r\n\r\nspark \\\r\n    .readStream \\\r\n    .format(\"rate\") \\\r\n    .load()\\\r\n    .withColumn(\"foo\", fooUDF(col(\"value\")))\\\r\n    .writeStream\\\r\n    .format(\"console\")\\\r\n    .trigger(continuous=\"1 second\").start() \r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that test was not ported because:\r\n\r\n1. `IntegratedUDFTestUtils` only exists in master.\r\n2. Missing SS testing utils in PySpark code base.\r\n3. Writing new test for branch-2.4 specifically might bring even more overhead due to mismatch against master.","created_at":"2019-08-15T00:52:21Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:25Z","closed_at":"2019-08-15T04:36:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c737adc1254ea2d39b1500bef577198340e1718","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c5fdd668be1f31561849e5fe485e814e318a3ef","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-27234-backport","ref":"SPARK-27234-backport","sha":"4c5fdd668be1f31561849e5fe485e814e318a3ef","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a simple cost model and a mechanism to compare the costs of the before and after plans of each re-optimization in Adaptive Query Execution. Now the workflow of AQE re-optimization is changed to: If the cost of the plan after re-optimization is lower than or equal to that of the plan before re-optimization and the plan has been changed after re-optimization (if equal), the current physical plan will be updated to the plan after re-optimization, otherwise it will remain unchanged until the next re-optimization.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis new mechanism is to prevent regressions in Adaptive Query Execution caused by change of the plan introducing extra cost, in this PR specifically, change of SMJ to BHJ leading to extra `ShuffleExchangeExec`s.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

documentation.","created_at":"2019-08-14T13:07:33Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T16:18:44Z","closed_at":"2019-08-14T16:06:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22495fa14a6e9d85dc8857e573fe727576538ba9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627011,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MDEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCUMENTATION","name":"DOCUMENTATION","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25454/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25454/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25454/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e0e16ca9199f5c4e6400fc33767607d5392d5a48","head":{"label":"sujithjay:docs/parquet-nullability","ref":"docs/parquet-nullability","sha":"e0e16ca9199f5c4e6400fc33767607d5392d5a48","user":{"login":"sujithjay","id":17567499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY3NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17567499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay","html_url":"https://github.com/sujithjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":93888385,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Mzg4ODM4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sujithjay/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sujithjay","id":17567499,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTY3NDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17567499?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay","html_url":"https://github.com/sujithjay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sujithjay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sujithjay/spark","description":"Fork

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter all the discussions in the dev list: http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Discuss-Follow-ANSI-SQL-on-table-insertion-td27531.html#a27562. \r\nHere I propose that we can make the store assignment rules in the analyzer configurable, and the behavior of V1 and V2 should be consistent.\r\nWhen inserting a value into a column with a different data type, Spark will perform type coercion. After this PR, we support 2 policies for the type coercion rules: \r\nlegacy and strict. \r\n1. With legacy policy, Spark allows casting any value to any data type. The legacy policy is the only behavior in Spark 2.x and it is compatible with Hive. \r\n2. With strict policy, Spark doesn't allow any possible precision loss or data truncation in type coercion, e.g. `int` and `long`, `float` -> `double` are not allowed.\r\n\r\nEventually, the \"legacy\" mode will be removed, so it is disallowed in data source V2.\r\nTo ensure backward compatibility with existing queries, the default store assignment policy for data source V1 is \"legacy\".\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\ncreate or replace function **X as 'Y' using jar Z**;  does not work if the X is already present and is created with some other jar lets say xyz.\r\n\r\nAs per current implementation spark calls alter Function API of Hive, as of now Hive only alter name, owner, class name, type but not resource URI. After calling alter function only  **X and Y**  are updated **but not Z.**\r\n\r\nSo when the select is performed on X UDF it throws class not found exception.\r\n\r\nObservation 1: Temporary function does not have this problem as it is handled by spark logic \r\n\r\nObservation 2: For permanent function Spark calls the Hive to alter function , as of now Hive only alter name, owner, class name,
