Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 1366](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1366) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nRight now Airflow deletes the task instance when user clear it. We have no way of keeping track of how many times a task instance gets run either via user or itself. So instead of deleting the task instance record, we should keep the task instance and make try_number monotonically increasing for every task instance attempt. max_tries is introduced as an upper bound for retrying tasks by task itself.  \r\n\r\nThis new column will be used to update logic behind clear_task_instances in #2383 \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ndb migration is tested locally.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n@aoen

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!  @criccomini \r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1359\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis creates three consecutive operators, doing Cloud ML BatchPrediction, running Cloud Dataflow to get summary, and do validation.\r\nUsers would provide python callables to calculate metrics and validate averaged metrics to customize the evaluation behavior, then the function will create a relevant set of operators for the evaluation.\r\n\r\nAs this is not actually an operator, but a function that returns operators, I'm not sure if this file/folder is a good location to put. Please advise otherwise.\r\nIf this is not appropriate, perhaps some potential changes are either\r\n  1. move the changes to example_dags folder, and users would import files there, or\r\n  2. create a subdag operator doing the same thing instead of a python function.\r\nWDYT?\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  I've done testing by running dags using those operators within Cloud VMs.\r\n  Also added a test using mocks.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1356\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf we start multiple `celery worker` on the same machine, each worker should have individual hostname to distinguish each other. Otherwise, some tools might not work correctly. E.g. celery flower would show only one worker if all workers are of the same hostname.\r\n\r\nThis PR add `--celery_hostname` or `-cn` option on `airflow worker` subcommand. The option should accept an argument with the syntax as same as the option `-n` of `celery worker` command.\r\ncelery worker doc: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html\r\n\r\nFor example, one can add the `-cn` option as following.\r\n```sh\r\nairflow worker -c 1 -q highmem -cn highmem@%h\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR is simple enough and there's no airflow worker related unittests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1321\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWebserver has a feature to hide sensitive variable fields,\r\nwhich key contain specific words. But its matching is\r\ncase-sensitive, so \"google_api_key\" is hidden but\r\n\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\" is not. This behaviour is not intuitive,\r\nso this PR fixes it to be case-insensitive.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded tests/www/test_utils.py.\r\nIn addition, I confirmed the feature behaved expectedly as the following screenshot:\r\n![v](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/898388/27528613-275e4b0a-5a8c-11e7-80da-2034421edf20.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-891\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently the webserver clock has only hour and minute.\r\nWe change the clock format to \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\",\r\nbecause date information is helpful for user and\r\nthis format is universal.\r\n\r\nI updated jqClock.min.js with the latest version for now\r\n(https://github.com/JohnRDOrazio/jQuery-Clock-Plugin/tree/v2.3.0).\r\n<img width=\"1152\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-06-26 at 1 38 16\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/898388/27517983-9e676122-5a10-11e7-90e1-db1e16e931d8.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded no test. Instead, I ran webserver manually and confirmed the clock was displayed expectedly. Also, I confirmed all unit tests passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1316\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-450\r\n\r\nThere have been 2 PR attempts to fix this and none got merged:\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1753\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1890\r\n\r\nClearly the example dag operator causes more trouble than its worth its value, so I'm suggesting to have it removed (I was the original author). \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that if this example dag is very much desired, we find a reliable and consistent HTTP source that this can be programmed against first, then work out the implementation.","created_at":"2017-06-24T18:16:30Z","updated_at":"2018-12-12T19:31:39Z","closed_at":"2018-10-27T22:19:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ee3c25c97da25da58c537e0f76c94b094cbdb58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1345\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: I removed the commit on each iteration of the loop. At the beginning of this function, we batch query TIs. The commit expires all these TIs, forcing us to requery them on each iteration. This is very slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: Doesn't change existing behavior. There's already tests in SchedulerJob\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n@aoen @bolkedebruin

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [[AIRFLOW-1326] Contrib Spark Submit Hook should be able to produce arguments containing spaces.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1326) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis was broken in #2289/[AIRFLOW-1184](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1184) and was a case of user error to me (probably caused by wrong/misleading tests).\r\n\r\nSince application_args was already an array the correct way of providing an flag and a value is in two items, not one. (i.e. the correct way is `['--option', 'value']`, not `['--option value']`) Otherwise there is no way to include an argument that includes a space.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR updates the following unit tests: `tests/contrib/operators/test_spark_submit_operator.py` to be less confusing (i.e. split the args as stated in the previous paragraph. This has no functional difference to the tests but will be correct if someone goes to look at it). Update tests to `tests/contrib/hooks/test_spark_submit_hook.py` to cover this case explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 1325](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1325) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nPlease refer to [Airflow 1325](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1325) for more details.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on #2383 \r\n\r\nThis PR is made the following changes:\r\n#### Frontend\r\n- [ti_logs.html](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2380/files#diff-5b54137fc072a538153e4a873e9f37b7) This adds JS to fetch from flask endpoint `get_log`.\r\n#### Flask Endpoint\r\n- [get_log](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2380/files#diff-948e87b4f8f644b3ad8c7950958df033R715) The endpoint for fetching logs from logging backend.\r\n#### Logging Backend (Most Important)\r\n- `airflow/logging_backends` folder.  The general idea here is to dynamically instantiate logging backend class based on user configuration `logging_backend_url`. The current logic with S3/GCS won't be changed if `logging_backend_url` is not configured.\r\n  - `BaseLoggingBackend`: an interface exposed to query logs. `ElasticsearchLoggingBackend` is an implementation of this base class.\r\n  - `imports.py`: a util file to get class reference by name.\r\n  - `logging_backend.py`: it acts like cached_app except it returns a cached logging backend.\r\n#### Test\r\n- `test_elasticsearch_logging_backend.py`: A ES integration test.\r\n- `test_elasticsearch.sh`: A script to run integration test with Elasticsearch logging backend using Docker. This is not added to Travis-CI because Elasticesarch requires > 30s to install, initialize and execute the test.\r\n- `test_logging_backend.py`: Test getting logging backend correctly.\r\n- `test_imports.py`: Test importing class by its full name.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- Unit test for logging_backend.py and imports.py\r\n- Integration test for ElasticsearchLogginBackend using Docker. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n@aoen @amaliujia

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-801\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe docstring of the BaseOperator still makes reference to\r\nit inheriting from SQL Alchemy's Base class,\r\nwhich it no longer does. So that should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo additional test since it's just documentation fix.\r\nConfirmed that the webpage is expectedly rendered.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-17T04:28:39Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T22:04:33Z","closed_at":"2017-06-23T21:51:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6dd8b05a57eadf446ad90d38f297a5b0d96041a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/390623ecdf7d95aa65b42c027f3a7ba7b3279149","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-801","ref":"AIRFLOW-801","sha":"390623ecdf7d95aa65b42c027f3a7ba7b3279149","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-393) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAllows a user to pass a callback when downloading an FTP file. An obvious benefit to this is offering a way to log progress as a file downloads. This __heavily__ borrows from @jlowin's [PR].(https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1704/files)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\nAdds tests to verify callback is actually called if passed in and also verifies default behavior (passing retrieved data to the write buffer) is preserved in lieu of a custom callback. Also adds tests for some of the helper functions.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-16T23:01:02Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T12:17:17Z","closed_at":"2018-10-12T11:30:42Z","merged_at":"2018-10-12T11:30:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"345b80fe4f40f0f5860212a9d931ccea9487cc7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2372/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2372/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2372/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/9325330b4628ba93904fad236908938c5ef9071a","head":{"label":"akosel:airflow-393-add-retrieve-callback","ref":"airflow-393-add-retrieve-callback","sha":"9325330b4628ba93904fad236908938c5ef9071a","user":{"login":"akosel","id":5097634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTc2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5097634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel","html_url":"https://github.com/akosel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94393981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDM5Mzk4MQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"akosel/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akosel","id":5097634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTc2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5097634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel","html_url":"https://github.com/akosel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akosel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akosel/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1077] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1077\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAddresses a case that may be counter-intuitive to users where a subdag count greater than the concurrency limit can lead to deadlock. It also suggests a workaround for dealing with this issue.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nIt's a comment so there isn't anything to test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-15T03:08:16Z","updated_at":"2018-12-22T19:18:03Z","closed_at":"2018-12-22T19:18:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89b98fc22287664c7fba6760c8af3543346d8b1e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1294\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn backfills we can loose tasks to execute due to a task\r\nsetting its own state to NONE if concurrency limits are reached,\r\nthis makes them fall outside of the scope the backfill is\r\nmanaging hence they will not be executed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nShould be covered by current tests, will adjust if required.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch @aoen @saguziel This is a simplified fix that should be easier to digest in 1.8.2. It does not address all underlying issues as in https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2356 , but those can be addressed separately and in smaller

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1294\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn the backfills we can loose tasks to execute due to a task\r\nsetting its own state to NONE if concurrency limits are reached,\r\nthis makes them fall outside of the scope the backfill is\r\nmanaging hence they will not be executed.\r\n\r\nSeveral bugs are the cause for this. Firstly, the state\r\nreported by the executor was always reported as success, ie.\r\nthe return code of the task instance was not propagated.\r\nNext to that, if the executor already has a task instance\r\nin its queue it will silently ignore the task instance\r\nbeing added. The backfills did not guard against this, thus\r\ntasks could get lost here as well.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces CONCURRENCY_REACHED as an executor\r\nstate, which will be set if the task exits with EBUSY (16).\r\nThis allows the backfill to properly handle these tasks\r\nand reschedule them. Please note that the CeleryExecutor\r\ndoes not report back on executor states.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nLooking at an approach to updated tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \" My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1287\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis is a bugfix targeting a regression from 1.7.* where tasks get queried in the ShortCiruit and Branching Python operators but fail to filter on dag id, so multiple unrelated tasks in other dags that have the same execution dates and task ids get marked as skipped.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses [Airflow 936](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-936) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a modal popup when clicking circle DAG icon in Airflow tree view UI. It adds the functionalities to clear/mark success of the entire DAG run. This behavior is equivalent to individually clear/mark each task instance in the DAG run. The original logic of editing DAG run page is moved to the button \"Edit DAG Run\".\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-06-07 at 10 19 59 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5182499/26891746-ed241fda-4b6a-11e7-9179-e513f8abf530.png)\r\n![screen shot 2017-06-01 at 10 42 14 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5182499/26693003/8c355188-46b7-11e7-910f-bf1e09bf4418.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n Tests are added under `test/api/common/mark_tasks.py` to test marking entire DAG as success. There is no test for clear the DAG since it is directly implemented in `views.py`.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n@aoen

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1252] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1252\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  When user use experimental API to create a DagRun, if conf is present in Json sent to Airflow, it will never generate the DagRun due to a exception in trigger_dag method (it is expecting a string instead of dictionary).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  tests.api.common.experimental.trigger_dag_tests:TriggerDagTests.test_trigger_dag_with_str_conf\r\n  tests.api.common.experimental.trigger_dag_tests:TriggerDagTests.test_trigger_dag_with_dict_conf\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-31T13:25:56Z","updated_at":"2018-11-18T21:27:10Z","closed_at":"2018-11-18T17:34:20Z","merged_at":"2018-11-18T17:34:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"db973e98868a3c0fd412d4f9cd821b3c0020cb45","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2334/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2334/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2334/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/e796325d6397c6b9c5e3643c166e4f284f0f2a81","head":{"label":"Tecsisa:AIRFLOW-1252","ref":"AIRFLOW-1252","sha":"e796325d6397c6b9c5e3643c166e4f284f0f2a81","user":{"login":"Tecsisa","id":6705749,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY3MDU3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6705749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa","html_url":"https://github.com/Tecsisa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92936001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MjkzNjAwMQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Tecsisa/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tecsisa","id":6705749,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjY3MDU3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6705749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa","html_url":"https://github.com/Tecsisa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tecsisa/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Tecsisa/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1248\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe parameter `web_server_worker_timeout` is wrongly\r\nreferenced by airflow/bin/cli.py. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI think no additional test is needed since this is a really trivial fix.\r\nI locally ran webserver and confirmed that it started with the right timeout value.\r\nAnd I grepped and confirmed that there's no the same typo in the source.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-26T07:57:11Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T18:17:54Z","closed_at":"2017-05-26T18:17:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ec664d32120ba7e3d1e02ab05e008905d0b59cc6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2328/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2328/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2328/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/bb4dd4018ba410efcfd6002226f8e4b9ef29dd51","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-1248","ref":"AIRFLOW-1248","sha":"bb4dd4018ba410efcfd6002226f8e4b9ef29dd51","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1172\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\"nth weekday of the month\" cron expression is available\r\nfrom croniter 0.3.17. This PR updates croniter and\r\nenables that feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI think no additional unit test is needed, since\r\ncroniter itself has unit tests for this feature.\r\nI locally run scheduler with the new expression\r\nand confirmed that it behaved as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-22T15:16:40Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T00:59:37Z","closed_at":"2017-06-15T00:59:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa14b319964e4b679eaeb87c770389bdfbe095e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2321/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2321/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2321/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3f672c3ee241cdbb800025a7d99eea040477261c","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-1172","ref":"AIRFLOW-1172","sha":"3f672c3ee241cdbb800025a7d99eea040477261c","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache
