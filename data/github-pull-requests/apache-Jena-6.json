issue resolved #2270 \r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\nAs illustrated in the sample code on the linked issue, when creating literal nodes of xsd:string type we are not converting the given objects to Strings but rather are leaving them as the original classes. Instead of UUIDs, the same effect can be made if passed Integers, Floats or any other object type. \r\n`\r\nNodeFactory.createLiteralByValue(UUID.randomUUID(), XSDDatatype.XSDstring);\r\nNodeFactory.createLiteralByValue(9, XSDDatatype.XSDstring);\r\nNodeFactory.createLiteralByValue(9.99f, XSDDatatype.XSDstring);\r\n`\r\nWhat's interesting is that for numeric types, this isn't the case and if passing a (valid) string to numeric type everything works as expected.\r\n`\r\nNodeFactory.createLiteralByValue(\"9\", XSDDatatype.XSDint);\r\nNodeFactory.createLiteralByValue(\"9.99\", XSDDatatype.XSDfloat);\r\n`\r\n\r\nThe fix is relatively simple. When processing the canonised form (using the \"cannonicalise\" (sic) method) of the XSDBaseStringType the original value is being returned. By contrast, if you look at the equivalent XSDBaseNumericType the value is converted into the appropriate type. \r\n\r\nTo that end, I've added some tests to illustrate this by creating both string and numerical literal nodes passing in differing classes.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Documentation change and updates are provided for the [Apache Jena

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.3.3</h2>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a breaking change introduced with color modes where it was required to manually import <code>variables-dark.scss</code> when building Bootstrap with Sass. Now, <code>_variables.scss</code> will automatically import <code>_variables-dark.scss</code>. If you were already importing <code>_variables-dark.scss</code> manually, you should keep doing it as it won't break anything and will be the way to go in v6.</li>\n<li>Fixed a regression in the selector engine that wasn't able to handle multiple IDs anymore.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Color modes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Badges now use the <code>.text-bg-*</code> text utilities to be certain that the text is always readable (especially when the customized colors are different in light and dark modes).</li>\n<li>Fixed our <code>color-modes.js</code> script to handle the case where the OS is set to light mode and the auto color mode is used on the website. If you copied the script from our docs, you should apply <a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/commit/73e1dcf43eff8371dde52ce41bd1d9fdc2b47d1f\">this change</a> to your own script.</li>\n<li>Fixed color schemes description in the color modes documentation to show that <code>color-scheme()</code> only accept <code>light</code> and <code>dark</code> values as parameters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allowed <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> in the sanitizer.</li>\n<li>Dropped evenly items distribution for modal and offcanvas headers.</li>\n<li>Fixed the accordion CSS selectors to avoid inheritance issues when nesting accordions.</li>\n<li>Fixed the focus box-shadow for the validation stated form controls.</li>\n<li>Fixed the focus ring on focused checked buttons.</li>\n<li>Fixed the product example mobile navbar toggler.</li>\n<li>Changed the RTL processing of carousel control icons.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>🎨 CSS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/37508\">#37508</a>: Use child combinators to avoid inheriting parent accordion's flush styles</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/38719\">#38719</a>: Fix focus box-shadow for validation stated form-controls</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/38884\">#38884</a>: fix border-radius on radio-switch</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39294\">#39294</a>: Tests: update navbar in visual modal test</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39373\">#39373</a>: refactor css: modal and offcanvas header spacing</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39380\">#39380</a>: Fix Sass compilation breaking change in v5.3</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39387\">#39387</a>: docs: fix typo</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39411\">#39411</a>: Optimize the accordion icon</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39497\">#39497</a>: Fix a typo</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39536\">#39536</a>: Changed RTL processing of carousel control icons</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39560\">#39560</a>: Drop <code>--bs-accordion-btn-focus-border-color</code> and deprecate <code>$accordion-button-focus-border-color</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39595\">#39595</a>: CSS: Fix the focus ring on focused checked buttons</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>☕️ JavaScript</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39201\">#39201</a>: Selector Engine: fix multiple IDs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39224\">#39224</a>: Fix edge case in <code>color-mode.js</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39376\">#39376</a>: Allow <code>dl</code>, <code>dt</code> and <code>dd</code> in sanitizer</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>📖 Docs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39200\">#39200</a>: Typo Fix</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39214\">#39214</a>: Doc: use <code>.text-bg-{color}</code> for all badges</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/39246\">#39246</a>: Docs: fix for example code blocks have unnecessary 30px right-margin</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

enable built-in <code>pkg:</code> importers.

For example, <code>@use &quot;pkg:bootstrap&quot;</code> will load <code>node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JavaScript API</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a <code>NodePackageImporter</code> importer that can be passed to the <code>importers</code> option. This loads files using the <code>pkg:</code> URL scheme according to the Node.js package resolution algorithm. For example, <code>@use &quot;pkg:bootstrap&quot;</code> will load <code>node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss</code>. The constructor takes a single optional argument, which indicates the base directory to use when locating <code>node_modules</code> directories.

issue resolved #2267\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\n@LorenzBuehmann first tentative to fix the issue. I was going to change the `Pagination` Vue component, so that it had an option like `maxItems` (or max displayed, etc). And set it to some value like `5` or `6` as that would fix in the screen, and show the first `2` or `3`, followed by `[…]` , and then the last `2` or `3`.\r\n\r\nBut I know sometimes users may want to know the page they are in, and also be able to jump from page 23 to page 4, which wouldn't be possible doing that.\r\n\r\nNot the most beautiful, but maybe this simpler approach to just display everything visibly works OK for this page? Or should we keep it one line only, abbreviating the list? What do you think?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/jena/assets/304786/5cbf77bb-590d-4d21-9e58-923c64ab033e)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ] Documentation change and

the <code>text()</code> method (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/vuejs/test-utils/pull/2231\">vuejs/test-utils#2231</a>) may force developers to update tests that were checking the text of several elements at once, as the spaces of each element are now trimmed (as they are when using <code>text()</code> on a single element). So if you were checking the text of <code>&lt;span&gt;Trimmed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Example&lt;/span&gt;</code>, it is now <code>TrimmedExample</code> instead of <code>Trimmed Example</code> (and the <code>text()</code> of the first span is still <code>Trimmed</code> as it was before).</p>\n<h3>Fix</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>fix: (could be considered a feature?) allow custom

some package-private methods whose signature includes the Java 8 <code>Collector</code> API. This is a test to identify any problems before we expose those methods publicly to users. Please report any problems that you encounter. (73dbf7ef26)</li>\n<li>Changed various classes to catch <code>Exception</code> instead of <code>RuntimeException</code> even when only <code>RuntimeException</code> is theoretically possible. This can help code that throws undeclared exceptions, as some bytecode rewriters (e.g., Robolectric) and languages (e.g., Kotlin) do. (c294c23760, 747924e, b2baf48)</li>\n<li>Added an <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code> to <code>failureaccess</code>, <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">Guava's one strong runtime dependency</a>. (280b5d2f60)</li>\n<li><code>reflect</code>: In <code>guava-android</code> only, removed <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. These methods never worked in an Android VM, and to reflect that, they were born <code>@Deprecated</code>, <code>@Beta</code>, and <code>@DoNotCall</code>. They're now preventing us from rolling out some new Android compatibility testing. This is <strong>the only binary-incompatible change in this release</strong>, and it should have no effect in practice. Still, we bump the major version number to follow Semantic Versioning. (045cd8428f)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed our implementations to avoid eagerly initializing loggers during class loading. This can help performance, especially under Android.

encoding).\r\n\r\nThis code does not do an RFC 3986 parsing of the URI string nor does it provide punycode host names.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [x] Key commit messages start with the issue number (GH-xxxx, or if in JIRA, JENA-xxxx)\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I
