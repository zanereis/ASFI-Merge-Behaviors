function DagBag.get_dag has some logic to check if the serialized dag object should be refreshed. By accessing the dags dict directly we avoid that logic, and this is helpful for running a task exclusively with the internal API.  Generally speaking this function \"get_dag\" is invoked when running the task command on a worker, and in that context we shouldn't need to handle expiration of the serdag.  For the case where we're reading from db, I have left the original method call in place (which keeps the expiration logic in effect for that scenario).","created_at":"2024-03-27T21:27:38Z","updated_at":"2024-07-18T21:43:44Z","closed_at":"2024-04-02T16:16:19Z","merged_at":"2024-04-02T16:16:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"eba50465a6110cb1a5597abcaabf088cb3a9c057","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vincbeck","id":97131062,"node_id":"U_kgDOBcoaNg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97131062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck","html_url":"https://github.com/vincbeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vincbeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

it possible to use the alpha/experimental AWS ECS Executor with the Helm chart. (link: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-amazon/stable/executors/ecs-executor.html)\r\n\r\nThe changes are:\r\n\r\n1. Add the following executors into the allowed `executor` values:\r\n   - ``airflow.providers.amazon.aws.executors.batch.AwsBatchExecutor``\r\n   - ``airflow.providers.amazon.aws.executors.ecs.AwsEcsExecutor``\r\n2. Truncate the `executor` label value to a max of ~50~ 63 characters because Kubernetes doesn't allow a label value with more than ~50~ 63 characters.\r\n3. Updated the Helm chart README.\r\n\r\nI've tested this setup and it works.

I believe it is also a good choice to be transparent in this \r\ndirect usage because requests is a very popular HTTP library so most \r\npeople already know how these arguments are expected. \r\n\r\nThe `params` argument could also be introduced in the HttpOperator with the same goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR was meant to address #37291 after seeing the discussion started here

the `extraContainers` and `extraInitContainers` are passed on an \"as-is\" basis. What this means in practice is that if you depend on a release-specific resource you have to manually provide the names rather than use templating.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nExample: mounting a release-specific `ConfigMap` into an `extraContainer`\r\n\r\nThe following config will not work, since it produces an init container which references `{{ .Release.Name }}-stuff-config` copied verbatim, rather than the templated value including the actual release name as you would expect.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nworkers:\r\n  extraInitContainers:\r\n    - name: init-stuff\r\n      image: does/stuff:1.0.0\r\n      envFrom:\r\n        - configMapRef:\r\n            name: \"{{ .Release.Name }}-stuff-config\"\r\n\r\nextraConfigMaps:\r\n  '{{ .Release.Name }}-stuff-config':\r\n    data: |-\r\n      STUFF_ENV_VAR1: one\r\n      STUFF_ENV_VAR2: two\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR enables templating for `extraContainers` and `extraInitContainers` fields to fix this issue and improve the reusability of the chart.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

not handled deprecation warnings~\r\n\r\nAfter spending some time I've collect all tests which raise one of the selected warning during test runs\r\n* `airflow.exceptions.AirflowProviderDeprecationWarning`\r\n* `airflow.exceptions.RemovedInAirflow3Warning`\r\n* `airflow.utils.context.AirflowContextDeprecationWarning`\r\n\r\nWith some hacks and tricks I've enable validation that this warning not raised (e.g. not captured by `pytest.warn`)\r\nUnfortunetly this action require to slightly change current warning collection and use only `warnings.catch_warnings` and default `warnings.filterwarnings` / `warnings.simplefilter`\r\n\r\nSome side affect might happen when change one part it affect other parts which do not run into the tests, as result temporary broken `main`, solution for this one pretty simple: make changes as follow up commit / revert commit / add it into the exclusion list `tests/deprecations_ignore.yml` (last resort)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Simple snippet for collect list of test from pytest error summary</summary>\r\n  \r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\nnode_pattern = re.compile(r\"::\")\r\n\r\nraw

using the [TaskHandlerWithCustomFormatter](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/utils/log/task_handler_with_custom_formatter.py) to add a prefix to logs, it was previously adding the prefix multiple times. This happened because its `set_context` method was being called multiple times from [logging_mixin.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/utils/log/logging_mixin.py#L256)'s `set_context`, and worsened because even when the handler's formatter was a [TimezoneAware](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/utils/log/timezone_aware.py) formatter (to include UTC offset), it was still adding an additional prefix. Because of this, I felt that any solution outside of the TaskHandlerWithCustomFormatter itself would either require a restructuring of the handlers' structure or slow down execution for all other handlers. And so, the solution I settled on was to add to [TaskHandlerWithCustomFormatter's initial 'if' statement](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/utils/log/task_handler_with_custom_formatter.py#L48) a simple \"`or self.prefix_jinja_template is not None`\", so that it returns if the prefix has already been set. This is similar to what is done by the ElasticSearch handler [es_task_handler.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/elasticsearch/log/es_task_handler.py#L443).\r\n\r\nNote: also fixed the documentation's example for the handler, as the previous one was incorrect and didn't work.\r\n\r\ncloses: #35622\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

cache for breeze might cause various issues and it does not really speed up the installation that significantly (installing breeze is about 20 seconds and restoring cache and checking if breeze is installed there is ~8 seconds, so we are savig some 10 seconds per build.\r\n\r\nRemoving cache will make breeze always runs in a clean state and also it has less potential for potential cache-poisoning issues. Since cache is shared among multiple workflows and runs, that is also far safer option from security point of view.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

tests are run either when we run tests on airflow runners (then we run them all as a single step) or when we run integration tests on public runners, we run each of the integration tests separately.

had a bunch of complicated logic trying to separate out unconnected dataset \"graphs\" from each other in the UI. It was buggy and could cause the UI to crash if there were too many datasets. So I decided to refactor a few things wih the tools I have available:\r\n\r\n- Always render the full datasets dependencies graph\r\n- Merge the Dataset and DAG search bars into one, with a single selection vs multiselect\r\n- Can click to select a DAG\r\n- Hover on a DAG shows popover to link to it's page\r\n- Add loading indicator to the graph\r\n- Zoom the graph to the node upon selection\r\n- Highlight edges connected to a DAG\r\n- Don't have the list/details left panel changing width when changing dataset selection\r\n\r\n<img width=\"544\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-25 at 6

PR tries to continue the work from [ @aleksandr-shel @xgao1023 @uranusjr ]  in PR #35320. It merges with current main. On top of this I fixed the bugs in pytest, some glitches in UI.\r\n\r\nI'd LOVE to get this into 2.9.0 and as there were a couple of reviews already on the previous PR I hope it is not as compex as it looks. A lot of code is also due to the fact that I try to migrate all examples over to \"nicer names\". Sneak preview how it could look like after this PR:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/95105677/071155eb-a4c2-4a91-be26-84ce9b7c7d4f)\r\n\r\nWhat is open to be merged?\r\n- [ ]

are using stdout of selective-check to print diagnostic information and stderr is redirected to produce outputs for GIHUB_OUTPUTS special variable in GitHub Actions. However this means that when there is an error when running selective-checks, the traceback goes to stderr and we cannot see it, plus it makes Github Actions to fail with crypttic errors.\r\n\r\nThis PR catches uncaught exception and uses rich mechanism to print the traceback to the diagnostic (stdout) console instead so that we can see it - in colour as well as with local variables, which might become handy.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

are using the [Cluster Policies](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/cluster-policies.html#task-instance-mutation) and in the the feature of the \"Task Instance Mutation\" to route workload to the respective endpoint. Respective endpoint means that we use multiple Celery queues and distribute the work. As the distribution is based on workflow meta data and we don't want to add the routing complexity into the workflow (modelling the workflow statically for all routing combinations) the task instance mutation is the only option.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #32471 we have seen that the task instance mutation works in general \"well\" for the first execution but we saw a couple of errors:\r\n- When using task_instance_mutation_hook the UI in DAGs->Grid->Task Details->More Details always shows the task definition value of queue and not the mutated value, which actually is stored in DB. More worse, when navigating in the UI the existing queue value in DB is reset to standard queue value w/o hook applied\r\n- When task fails, the retry does not apply the mutation hook and the task will go to standard queue again\r\n- When using dynamic task mapping, only first mapped task receives the queue from the mutation hook (later created during mapping not)\r\n\r\nRoot cause is that after initial task creation defaults are loaded from python code many times on multiple levels. Root casue seems to be `TaskInstance._refresh_from_task()`.\r\n\r\nFixing these to lines as in this PR removes all problems as described above. Trade-off will be that the policy code is executed a lot more often. But assuming this is not implemented with performance overhead it should not generate a performance impact.\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\n- Apply a cluster policy that changes the `queue` on some (or all :-D) tasks\r\n- Use for example the `example_params_trigger_ui` and introduce some random errors in the code. Example attached below.\r\n- Run this, ensure you have celcery workers serving the default and the \"other_queue\". I was setting an env `QUEUE` for the queue worker to print this in the DAG when testing\r\n- Check logs of failed tasks, mapped tasks that are not the first ones and UI display for \"queue\" field\r\n\r\ncloses: #32471\r\n\r\nFYI @AutomationDev85 @wolfdn @clellmann\r\n\r\nExample cluster policy used for testing as `airflow_local_settings.py`:\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow.models.taskinstance

updating all, hoping that the PR from @bbovenzi  --> #37988 is merged, then a few other screen-captures will need an update in general if the headers are changing.\r\n\r\nSide effect: Found some

currently hatchling and pip nicely supports dynamic replacement of the dependencies even if they are statically defined, this is not proper according to EP 621. When property of the project is set to be dynamic, it also contains static values. It's either static or dynamic.\r\n\r\nThis is not a problem for wheel packages when installed, by any standard tool, because the wheel package has all the metadata added to wheel (and does not contain pyproject.toml) but in various cases (such as installing airflow via Github URL or from sdist, it can make a difference - depending whether the tool installing airflow will use directly pyproject.toml for optimization, or whether it will run build hooks to prepare the dependencies).\r\n\r\nThis change makes all optional dependencies dynamici - rather than bake them in the pyproject.toml, we mark them as dynamic, so that any tool that uses pyproject.toml or sdist PKG-INFO will know that it has to run build hooks to get the actual optional dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are a few consequences of that:\r\n\r\n* our pyproject.toml will not contain automatically generated part - which is actually good, as it caused some confusion\r\n\r\n* all dynamic optional dependencies of ours are either present in hatch_build.py or calculated there - this is a bit new but sounds reasonable - and those dynamic dependencies are not really updated often, so thish is not an issue to maintain them there\r\n\r\n* the pre-commits that manage the optional dependencies got a lot simpler now - a lot of code has been removed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
