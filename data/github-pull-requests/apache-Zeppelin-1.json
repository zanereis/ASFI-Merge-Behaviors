What is this PR for?\r\nI propose removing the feature in Zeppelin's new UI that converts AngularJS code to Angular code.\r\n\r\nThis feature currently prompts users when they run code with the `%angular` prefix, asking whether to migrate AngularJS code to Angular, and performs the migration if confirmed.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for suggesting its removal are as follows:\r\n\r\n- The library supporting this feature is not compatible with the latest Angular versions due to peer dependency issues, making it difficult to upgrade Angular.\r\n- It is likely that this feature is not widely used by the community.\r\n\r\nRemoving this feature will reduce unnecessary library dependencies, which will help streamline future updates to the latest Angular versions.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other opinions, please feel free to share them.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nRemoving Feature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6151\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Strongly recommended: add automated unit tests for any new or changed behavior\r\n* Outline any manual steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-15T15:31:07Z","updated_at":"2024-11-25T03:20:33Z","closed_at":"2024-11-25T03:20:13Z","merged_at":"2024-11-25T03:20:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae48f71a564f5cb3e54759c9fcc214c4d8069517","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4900/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4900/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4900/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/c9cacb83eaf3041425d8843aa9b16ea293838f9b","head":{"label":"tbonelee:remove-ng1-migration","ref":"remove-ng1-migration","sha":"c9cacb83eaf3041425d8843aa9b16ea293838f9b","user":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808220072,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCx1qA","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"tbonelee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR introduces the `ZEPPELIN_EVENT_SERVER_PORT` configuration option.\r\nWhen this option is set, the Event server that communicates with interpreters will listen on the specified port.\r\n\r\nThe `ZEPPELIN_EVENT_SERVER_PORT` option takes precedence over `ZEPPELIN_SERVER_RPC_PORTRANGE` option.\r\nIf `ZEPPELIN_EVENT_SERVER_PORT` is set, the `ZEPPELIN_SERVER_RPC_PORTRANGE` range will be ignored.\r\n\r\nThis option is particularly useful when running individual Zeppelin components in container orchestration environments like Kubernetes.\r\nBy explicitly specifying the port, it allows for a more declarative and clearer configuration of service resources compared to `ZEPPELIN_SERVER_RPC_PORTRANGE`.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6143\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Run Zeppelin with and without this configuration and check zeppelin-server logs for the message `\"InterpreterEventServer is starting at \"`. Verify that the specified port is used as intended(If the option is set).\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-03T16:42:52Z","updated_at":"2024-12-05T08:39:28Z","closed_at":"2024-12-05T08:39:28Z","merged_at":"2024-12-05T08:39:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3551eb3a8a0141a670809a994f050baced3ac66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/344242dc641f43311486aa781f21ac7eb9ae7e5c","head":{"label":"tbonelee:add-fixed-interpreter-event-server-port-option","ref":"add-fixed-interpreter-event-server-port-option","sha":"344242dc641f43311486aa781f21ac7eb9ae7e5c","user":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808220072,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCx1qA","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"tbonelee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR applies synchronizer token pattern to terminal interpreter for CSWSH protection. The terminal interpreter is reported with a CSWSH(Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking) vulnerability. [An earlier PR](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4823) partially addressed this issue by implementing an origin check. However, this measure does not provide full protection, as it can't prevent attacks from scripts running within the same origin.\r\n\r\nTo enhance security, I implemented the synchronizer token pattern as an additional layer of protection. I modified the terminal HTML to be rendered with a Jinja template, allowing a CSRF token to be injected. This CSRF token is then validated on receiving the first WebSocket message, providing robust protection against CSWSH attacks.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n* [Spring Security WebSocket Same-Origin Policy](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/integrations/websocket.html#websocket-sameorigin)\r\n* [OWASP CSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet - Synchronizer Token Pattern](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#synchronizer-token-pattern)\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6142\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. After removing the origin check(by making the checkOrigin method always return true), connect to the terminal WebSocket and send a message without a valid CSRF token. \r\n2. Check that the connection is promptly closed and that an error is logged on the server.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nThe Maven clean goal does not remove some interpreter files in `interpreter/` directory as expected.\r\nSpecifically, the `spark` and `flink` interpreters are not cleaned.\r\n\r\nThis happens because when extending the `pom.xml` in the `pom.xml` of these interpreters, they lack the `interpreter.name` property.\r\nAs a result, the clean target directory configured in `zeppelion-interpreter-parent` was not properly resolved before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6135\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Build Zeppelin\r\n- Clean Zeppelin and check if all interpreters are removed in `interpreter/`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-21T12:32:13Z","updated_at":"2024-11-09T12:24:20Z","closed_at":"2024-11-06T13:30:45Z","merged_at":"2024-11-06T13:30:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"f172b917ae60d709dff3d81c0b5402384a8f4ecf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4881/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4881/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4881/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/789f33b66fbbb022e414c4cb79a543aea28d5638","head":{"label":"tbonelee:fix-interparent-clean","ref":"fix-interparent-clean","sha":"789f33b66fbbb022e414c4cb79a543aea28d5638","user":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808220072,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCx1qA","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"tbonelee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nIf I broke notebook's(*.zepl) JSON structure I can get error message like below.\r\n\r\n![image-2024-09-22-16-53-49-273](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24386e66-84f6-4902-b9d2-101af656f3e3)\r\n\r\nThere are two kind of problems.\r\n\r\n1. Same error message shows twice.\r\n2. Word break CSS style is not applied yet so it looks quite weird.\r\n\r\nSo I fixed it correct way.\r\n\r\n[How to solve]\r\n1. Check [/zeppelin-web-angular/src/app/pages/workspace/notebook/notebook.component.ts](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/bdf5b067b6bdde2614b98a6a3f6a7b5d6637e57c/zeppelin-web-angular/src/app/pages/workspace/notebook/notebook.component.ts) file and found [L392](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/bdf5b067b6bdde2614b98a6a3f6a7b5d6637e57c/zeppelin-web-angular/src/app/pages/workspace/notebook/notebook.component.ts#L392), [L396](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/bdf5b067b6bdde2614b98a6a3f6a7b5d6637e57c/zeppelin-web-angular/src/app/pages/workspace/notebook/notebook.component.ts#L396) causing same error([ERROR_INFO](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/bdf5b067b6bdde2614b98a6a3f6a7b5d6637e57c/zeppelin-server/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/socket/NotebookServer.java#L2294-L2310)) at the same time.\r\n2. So I just handle it with [/zeppelin-web-angular/src/app/app-message.interceptor.ts](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/bdf5b067b6bdde2614b98a6a3f6a7b5d6637e57c/zeppelin-web-angular/src/app/app-message.interceptor.ts) this file to this https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4872/commits/67bec5c3415b9fa6d23f842a61d2ee0a5f139dac\r\n3. I just added `word-wrap` and `word-break` options to `nzNotificationService.warning` function's third parameter for correct style issue https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/4872/commits/d0e73057c9ee76a9af8b4caf53e68bb240d00328\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [[ZEPPELIN-6097](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6097)]\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1624\" alt=\"스크린샷 2024-10-14 오후 10 26 25\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56cf3ae1-9eb6-4720-b6cc-9ef6a5ec5840\">\r\n1.

Check error message still appear twice.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? N\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? N\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

to link this github PR issues to the jira issue)\r\n\r\n### What is this PR for?\r\nThe `dev/checkout_zeppelin_pr.sh` script is useful for locally checking out PR commits.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it fetches the PR and checks out a new branch.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the script is run while already on the target branch, the updates are not reflected because `git checkout` does not move the `HEAD` when the current branch is already checked out.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this, the script has been updated to use `git pull` instead when the current branch is already checked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6125\r\n* Put link here, and add [ZEPPELIN-*Jira number*] in PR title, eg. [ZEPPELIN-533]\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Strongly recommended: add automated unit tests for any new or changed behavior\r\n* Outline any manual steps to test the PR here.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-06T12:28:26Z","updated_at":"2024-11-09T12:24:25Z","closed_at":"2024-10-07T13:14:40Z","merged_at":"2024-10-07T13:14:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"45c981be3699ef1eb44b65ad28ad7bc225bce549","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4870/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4870/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4870/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/e3f7a221cf1af5b2771b3644c5126e2f82d2f5cf","head":{"label":"tbonelee:enhance-checkout-script","ref":"enhance-checkout-script","sha":"e3f7a221cf1af5b2771b3644c5126e2f82d2f5cf","user":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808220072,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCx1qA","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"tbonelee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nThe `dev/checkout_zeppelin_pr.sh` script is useful for locally checking out PR commits.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it fetches the PR and checks out a new branch.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the script is run while already on the target branch, the updates are not reflected because `git checkout` does not move the `HEAD` when the current branch is already checked out.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this,

What is this PR for?\r\nThe ga-beacon link for Google Analytics tracking is broken. It is located on the [how_to_build](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.11.2/setup/basics/how_to_build.html#package) page.\r\n\r\nFor the following reasons, I removed this link:\r\n1. The broken link makes the page look poorly maintained. \r\n2. The ga-beacon doesn't seem to be supported anymore. \r\n3. The link doesn't seem intended to be on that page. Usually, it should be on the welcome page or across multiple pages. Since [this PR](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/1615/files#diff-180b6ccd4f65bde6bcd6ce9e7d6872d768d3b18c2e05f8faad36ff6279199ce1R343) relocated the link, I think it might have been unintentional.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nDocumentation\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* ZEPPELIN-6114\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Build documentation\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes some issues in the `dev/merge_zeppelin_pr.py` to make it smarter in suggesting \"backport branch\" and \"fixed versions\".\r\n\r\n1. improve the `x.y.z` version comparing\r\n\r\n   For versions: `[\"0.9.1\", \"0.10.1\", \"0.11.3\", \"0.12.0\"]`\r\n    \r\n   Previously, it was a simple string comparison, so the desc sorted result is `[\"0.9.1\", \"0.12.0\", \"0.11.3\", \"0.10.1\"]`; this PR changes it by interpreting each x, y, z as an int value and comparing sequence, thus the desc sorted result is `[\"0.12.0\", \"0.11.3\", \"0.10.1\", \"0.9.1\"]`\r\n\r\n2. improve the `branch-x.y` branch comparing\r\n\r\n   similar to 1, `branch-0.10` is higher than `branch-0.9`\r\n\r\n3. dedup `found_versions`\r\n\r\n   before\r\n   ```\r\n   Enter comma-separated fix version(s) [0.12.0,0.12.0]:\r\n   ```\r\n   after\r\n   ```\r\n   Enter comma-separated fix version(s) [0.12.0]:\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is

What is this PR for?\r\nSince the release of MongoDB 5.0, the mongo shell has been deprecated and replaced by mongosh. Although MongoDB 5.0 was released in July 2021, Apache Zeppelin still uses mongo as the default shell. Updating the default shell from mongo to mongosh would help beginners adapt more easily and align with current MongoDB standards.\r\n\r\n[Reference: MongoDB 5.0 Release Note](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0/#shell-changes)\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-6108]\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Run the MongoDB notebook\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR avoids an NPE when some MongoDB Interpreter configs are missing by replacing them with empty strings.\r\n\r\nIf certain MongoDB Interpreter configs, such as the username, password, or authenticationDatabase, are not entered, it throws an NPE. MongoDB allows logins without authentication when authentication is not enabled, so these configs are not always required. Since authentication is off by default in MongoDB, and these configs are also empty by default in Apache Zeppelin, this could be confusing for users.\r\nAnd as you can see in [shell_extension.js](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/ac48cc2db1b55257230cae2c382961da2a9cf80d/mongodb/src/main/resources/shell_extension.js#L115), the MongoDB interpreter appears to be designed to skip authorization when the username is null.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-6104]\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* run the MongoDB notebook\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? N\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? N\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

take effect when you refresh the notebook. \r\n2. fixes the cron refresh issue, i.e., when you update the cron setting, it always triggered the cron with the old cron expression,  because the cron

What is this PR for?\r\nThe misconfigured default `ZEPPELIN_ANGULAR_WAR` value is causing the failure to load the new UI web application files on development environment.\r\nThe new UI web apps are built into `ZEPPELIN_HOME/zeppelin-web-angular/dist/zeppelin`, but the default value lacks the `/zeppelin` postfix.\r\nWhen developers run Zeppelin with `ZeppelinServer.main` method, it defaults to the incorrect `ZEPPELIN_ANGULAR_WAR` value, leading to failure to load the web apps.\r\n*Note: This issue does not occur when Zeppelin is run using shell scripts in the `bin`, as they correctly set the `ZEPPELIN_ANGULAR_WAR` value.*\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/6099\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Build Zeppelin\r\n* Run Zeppelin using `ZeppelinServer.main` method and connect to `http://localhost:8080`\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-22T08:49:35Z","updated_at":"2024-09-22T12:29:48Z","closed_at":"2024-09-22T12:28:58Z","merged_at":"2024-09-22T12:28:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"ac48cc2db1b55257230cae2c382961da2a9cf80d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4840/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4840/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4840/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/e8e386acc0ba3a7aaec71e601f5f4438b83a420d","head":{"label":"tbonelee:fix-default-web-angular-config","ref":"fix-default-web-angular-config","sha":"e8e386acc0ba3a7aaec71e601f5f4438b83a420d","user":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808220072,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCx1qA","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"tbonelee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.  (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9819\">#9819</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the aarch64 build on macOS until it can be fixed. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9816\">#9816</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1-rc1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.0</h2>\n<p>2022-03-25 version 3.20.0 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Objective-C/C#/Ruby/JavaScript)</p>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped Ruby 2.3 and 2.4 support for CI and releases. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9311\">#9311</a>)</li>\n<li>Added Ruby 3.1 support for CI and releases (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9566\">#9566</a>).</li>\n<li>Message.decode/encode: Add recursion_limit option (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9218\">#9218</a>/<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9486\">#9486</a>)</li>\n<li>Allocate with xrealloc()/xfree() so message allocation is visible to the\nRuby GC.  In certain tests this leads to much lower memory usage due to more\nfrequent GC runs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9586\">#9586</a>).</li>\n<li>Fix conversion of singleton classes in Ruby (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9342\">#9342</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What is this PR for?\r\nA few sentences describing the overall goals of the pull request's commits.\r\n\r\nThe issue stems from the way the interpreter.sh script handles the ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_CMD and constructs the command to be executed. Specifically, the command string passed to bash -c is not being properly formed as a single string, causing exec to fail when it tries to execute the impersonation command.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Command Construction: When ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_CMD is set, the script attempts to build an array INTERPRETER_RUN_COMMAND that includes this command. However, if ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_CMD is a string, it gets added as a single element to the array, leading to incorrect command parsing.\r\n2. bash -c Behavior: The -c option in bash expects a single string argument that contains the command to execute. If this command is split into multiple array elements, bash misinterprets it, causing failures when it encounters shell built-ins like source.\r\n3. exec Execution: The exec command replaces the shell with the specified command. If the command is not correctly formatted, exec cannot find it, resulting in errors like exec: sudo -H -u rfialkovskii bash -c: not found.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue needs to adjust how the command is constructed in interpreter.sh when ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_CMD is used. Specifically, the command string passed to bash -c is a single, properly formatted string.\r\n\r\nNeeds:\r\nDefine ZEPPELIN_IMPERSONATE_CMD as an Array.\r\nModify interpreter.sh to Build a Single Command String:\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[* Open an issue on Jira

What is this PR for?\r\nI noticed that only some buttons in the first group of the action bar (highlighted in the red box in the image below) had tooltips, while others did not. To improve consistency and enhance user experience, I ensured that all buttons in the first group of the action bar display tooltips on hover.\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc89a350-fa2e-42b8-9cd2-b153ddc7431c\">\r\nI also considered adding tooltips to the other groups of the action bar (outside the red box), but due to the complexity of implementing this with the ng-zorro UI library, more time and investigation are needed. I aim to address this in a future update.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the paragraph controller currently lacks tooltips on its icons, which may be confusing for new users unfamiliar with Zeppelin (like myself). Without tooltips, it's unclear what each button does, leading to potential usability issues. I added tooltips to all icons in the paragraph controller to improve clarity and guide users of the functionality of each button.\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb9f7bb7-5940-416f-9c02-8c45b1e7ad6a\">\r\n\r\nThese changes aim to enhance the overall usability of the interface, making it more intuitive and consistent for all users.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\nSome buttons show no tooltips.\r\n![before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a75ba087-c4a9-4ad0-97d8-5c6732592164)\r\n\r\n\r\n**After**\r\nMissing tooltips are now displayed.\r\n![after](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e2bf1fa-361b-45ea-92ef-a27d3557ff88)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Add tooltips to action bar\r\n* [x] - Add tooltips to paragraph controller\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-6072](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-6072)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Build and test - check if tooltips are visible\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nZeppelin has `dev/merge_zeppelin_pr.py` that was borrowed from Spark, I would recommend committers use this script over the GitHub button to merge PR, which has some benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Simplify the backport process\r\n\r\nthe tools will ask you to backport the commit to lower maintained branches after you merge a PR to master, if there are no conflicts, all things you need to do are just type a \"branch name\" that you want to backport.\r\n\r\n2. Automatically update JIRA information\r\n\r\nthe script uses the python jira client to update JIRA ticket, for example, automatically closes the JIRA ticket after PR is merged, fills in the fixed versions, which is important to users to know the features/bug fixes applied to versions.\r\n\r\n3. Better PR title, body, and \"Signed-off-by\" info\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n<img width=\"1080\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f407592-e95f-4bd2-8ad9-fed25adaac72\">\r\n\r\nAfter \r\n<img width=\"1080\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43865062-c2f2-4ab9-aa44-9290e68162c9\">\r\n\r\nThis PR syncs the change from the Spark upstream (around 4.0.0-preview2), and has several improvements recently, e.g. support using tokens instead of passwords for GitHub and JIRA authentication. Additionally, this PR switches to the GitHub open API @jongyoul suggested to merge the PR, which fixed the merged PR status from \"Closed\" to \"Merged\"\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n* [x] - verify this script by merging at least 3 PRs\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nZEPPELIN-6089\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nManually test.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nIt seems that some integration tests are randomly failing due to timing discrepancies between rendering and verification.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the values are validated after rendering is fully completed, I added a slight sleep time.\r\n\r\nBefore the fix, 7 out of 20 runs failed in my personal repository's Github Actions due to one or both the two tests.\r\nHowever, after the fix, there were no failures from those two tests in 30 runs.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/6088\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- CI\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new configuration option `zeppelin.default.ui` to set the default UI for Zeppelin.\r\nThe available options for this setting are `new` and `classic`.\r\nBy default, the value is set to `new`, meaning the new UI will be served at the root path (`\"/\"`), while the classic UI will be available at `\"/classic\"`.\r\nIf the configuration is set to `classic`, the classic UI will be served at `\"/\"`, and the new UI at `\"/new\"`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/6085\r\n* Put link here, and add [ZEPPELIN-*Jira number*] in PR title, eg. [ZEPPELIN-533]\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Testing the `new` option :\r\n  - Set the `zeppelin.default.ui` config to `new` (the default).\r\n  - Verify that the new UI is served at the root (`\"/\"`) and the classic UI is available at `\"/classic\"`.\r\n  - Verify that navigating between pages works without any issue.\r\n  - Verify that the UI switching button works properly in both UIs.\r\n- Testing `classic` option :\r\n  - Similar steps as the above, except the new UI is served at `\"/classic\"` and the classic UI is available at the root (`\"/\"`)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the license files need to update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes, documentation for the new configuration option has been added.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-11T15:55:36Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T06:55:46Z","closed_at":"2024-10-09T06:50:17Z","merged_at":"2024-10-09T06:50:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"00b7c553694050d6d2ee4824a236bd76a7135646","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4824/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/4824/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/4824/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/e84e0c4c8ee771656f8eb276c6b48cc87f471e9d","head":{"label":"tbonelee:add-default-ui-config","ref":"add-default-ui-config","sha":"e84e0c4c8ee771656f8eb276c6b48cc87f471e9d","user":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808220072,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCx1qA","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"tbonelee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tbonelee","id":81022113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDIyMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81022113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee","html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tbonelee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tbonelee/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThe current issue is that the new UI fails to render dynamically created components at runtime, which causes the `%sh.terminal` interpreter to malfunction.\r\n\r\nThis problem occurs because Angular's AOT compiler removes decorators during the build process.([related issue](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9306))\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, Angular does not support JIT compilation alongside the AOT compiler.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need to render runtime dynamic components for compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\nBy Importing and re-exporting Angular core decorators, we can prevent the AOT compiler from removing them.\r\n(https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/9306#issuecomment-435404174)\r\nI believe there are two possible solutions: either implementing this fix or turning off AOT compilation.\r\nHowever, giving up the performance benefits of AOT compilation is not ideal, So I chose this approach.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/6076\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Run `%sh.terminal` interpreter and see if it renders well. \r\n  Note: Since Angular dev servers do not use AOT compilation, testing in development mode will not reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09c20c58-e86b-4432-b2ed-ee971c74af8a)\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1462\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7f6273b-4323-4f59-a23f-02e7696196b7\">\r\n- The connection status message appears broken due to incompatibility between Angular and AngularJS syntax,
