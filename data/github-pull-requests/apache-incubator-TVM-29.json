the concept of DMA group to align Hexagon User DMA with existing async copy solutions e.g. nVidia.  Allows for the grouping of one or more DMA copies into a group and tracking the group with \"in flight\" counts created by InjectSoftwarePipeline pass.  For now, this allows for the removal of `merge_async_commit_queue_scope` which was a Hexagon specific workaround due to lack of support for grouping DMA copies.  Later, in a future PR, this functionality may lead to the possibility of doing DMA copy on Hexagon over non-contiguous

PR adds cutlass BYOC pattern for conv2d and conv2d residual block. \r\n\r\nIn additional to the new patterns in the cutlass pattern table, this PR:\r\n1. Remove the assumption on fused function arg order from the conv2d codegen.\r\n2. Restructure how the cutlass pattern table is constructed, making it more readable.\r\n\r\nThe check logic at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/relay/op/contrib/cutlass.py#L200 isn't implemented in this PR yet because it requires non-trivial change to the interface of FuseOpsByPattern.

the `tir::Substitute` method had overloads that supported a few ways of providing the variable map (e.g. `const Map<Var,PrimExpr>&`, `std::unordered_map<const VarNode*, PrimExpr>&`, etc.), delegating out to the overload that uses `std::function<Optional<PrimExpr>(const Var&)>`.  However, the types supported for the variable map depended on the type being substituted (e.g. only supporting `const Map<Var,PrimExpr>&` with substituting into a `Array<Range>`), which would be unexpected to new developers.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the `tir::Substitute` utility more uniform in the arguments that it accepts.\r\n\r\n* For any type that is supported by `tir::Substitute`, `Array<T>` is also supported.\r\n\r\n* Any variable mapping type can be used with any substitution type. All variable mapping types are normalized to `std::function<Optional<PrimExpr>(const Var&)>`.\r\n\r\n* For `Map` and `std::unordered_map` arguments, the value type may be any subclass of `PrimExpr` (e.g. `Map<Var, Var>` instead of `Map<Var, PrimExpr>`).  Previously, the calling scope needed to either construct a temporary map that returned `PrimExpr`, or to use a broader value type in the map than otherwise required.\r\n\r\nThe initial and primary goal was to allow a `Map<Var, Var>` to be used as an argument to `tir::Substitute`, rather than a `Map<Var, PrimExpr>`, and making the utility more general was more straightforward than adding multiple overloads specificall for `Map<Var, Var>`.","created_at":"2023-03-09T17:45:01Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T21:14:42Z","closed_at":"2023-03-23T18:26:29Z","merged_at":"2023-03-23T18:26:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"b56d7f56ab25be031e9ca487555a9a6e6674f882","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14251/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14251/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14251/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e0d4f1f7b690e1fb27fe886fb0cfbf6653a7cc16","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:flexible_tir_substitute","ref":"flexible_tir_substitute","sha":"e0d4f1f7b690e1fb27fe886fb0cfbf6653a7cc16","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

the test `test_llvm_div`, some cases can lead to a division by 0. Consider the case when `start=-12, end=-12, dstart=-2 and dend=0`, the range of values input to clipb() will be: [-12, ..., -1, 1] (with 1 being specially selected to prevent division by 0). For the input 1, clipb evaluates to: `min(/*dend=*/0, max(/*dstart=*/-12, /*i=*/1)) = 0`, thus leading to a division by 0.\r\n\r\nLLVM11, which runs in CI, doesn't seem to throw any kind of error, while using LLVM15 leads to a \"floating point exception\". Regardless, since division by 0 is undefined behaviour and the compiler can do anything, the solution here is to fix the test so division by 0 doesn't

the static memory planning pass only works at single function level - each function inside the an IRModule will be independently planned. This is not perfect for the VM to reuse allocated memory across different functions.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR turns the static memory planning pass into a module pass. Now the plan is done across the IRModule, so that memory alloation in different functions can share the same storage token when planning. With this PR, it is hopeful that the VM will find more opportunities of memory reuse.","created_at":"2023-03-07T03:15:51Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T13:37:19Z","closed_at":"2023-03-07T13:37:19Z","merged_at":"2023-03-07T13:37:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"18472a779d67835a4fafd94f157a2d97a8b10704","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

old anchor trace apply assumes that the prefix of the \"new\" outputs matches with the \"old\" outputs, which is not the case for some tasks in complex models. Also the old approach use block name to match corresponding blocks among the old module in database and the new module to apply trace on.  In some cases, the block names may differ even though the block body are identical. In this PR, I maintain a block mapping between the old IRmodule and the new IRmodule, so that we can find the matching parts in both IRmodule with no assumptions of the relationship of their locations in IRModule.\r\n\r\ncc: @tqchen @junrushao @masahi

we found that the FX GraphModule captured by torch.dynamo will always return a tuple at the end, even if the Module being traced returns a single object.

Therefore, this PR introduces an option \"unwrap_return_unit_tuple\" to `from_fx`, to indicate if we caller wants to unwrap the returned unit tuple.\r\n\r\n`dynamo_subgraph_capture` now will always use True on this

class ImporterOutput introduced by #14197 turns out introducing inconvenience for use, as it is a wrapper of IRModule and the parameters, and prevents good composability when we want to combine multiple ImporterOutput together.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of easy use, we would like to return IRModule only. Therefore, as another approach, we can make the imported parameters as one function attribute, and detach the parameters later.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements this and provides the param detachment function. With only IRModule being manipulated, we can easily combine the results from multiple imports.","created_at":"2023-03-06T16:30:43Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T18:48:17Z","closed_at":"2023-03-06T18:48:17Z","merged_at":"2023-03-06T18:48:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"d86d0b201ceb163a862aa0921feab77f7ebed73b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

purpose of this PR is to add support for intrinsics to optimize matrix multiplication operations (e.g. matmul, convolution) during tuning with MetaScheduler.\r\n\r\nInformation about PR:\r\nThe present PR integrates the existing neon and dotprod (namely, sdot and udot) ARM CPU intrinsics into MetaScheduler, introduces a new \"hybrid\" dotprod intrinsic (\"hdot\") working with uint8, uint8 -> int32 data types, and changes the intrinsic selection and application processes for the ARM CPU case, since we operate with multiple intrinsics, rather than with a specific one.","created_at":"2023-03-06T11:04:10Z","updated_at":"2023-03-31T08:46:59Z","closed_at":"2023-03-31T08:46:39Z","merged_at":"2023-03-31T08:46:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"b724c87f76071c1c4d39c17aa0638bd94c878d61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14209/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14209/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14209/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/615d61f54e3297c65cdd9c9c748369b3c6c7e023","head":{"label":"Deelvin:dbarinov/metaschedule_arm_cpu_intrin","ref":"dbarinov/metaschedule_arm_cpu_intrin","sha":"615d61f54e3297c65cdd9c9c748369b3c6c7e023","user":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321290323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjEyOTAzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Deelvin/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Deelvin","id":74907834,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0OTA3ODM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74907834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin","html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deelvin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Deelvin/tvm","description":"Open

the legacy behavior of previous generation of TVMScript printer, LetStmt and Let expression in TIR are printed in the same syntax, i.e. `T.let`. This could be confusing and misleading at times.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new printer behavior in a backward compatible way. While ensuring all legacy `T.let` can be parsed properly, we introduce different syntax for each of them.\r\n\r\nFor LetStmt in TIR without concise scoping, the new syntax is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith T.LetStmt(value) as var:\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich was:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nvar = T.int32()\r\nwith T.let(var, value):\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor let expression in TIR PrimExpr, the new syntax becomes:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx = T.int32()\r\nT.Let(x + 1, where={x : 1})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich was:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx = T.int32()\r\nT.let(x, 1, x +

PR introduces the necessary change to make structural-hash platform-independent.

them with `uint64_t` explicitly.\r\n- Implement a platform-independent fast hashing algorithm for

to this PR, the cross-thread reduction lowering pass does not add a store predicate to the write-back block. This is in consideration that for a certain write-back buffer position, all values being stored (by all the threads) in the write-back block are the same. Since all threads are writing the same value, we were assuming that not having a write-back block predicate is fine, because the result will not be wrong in any way.\r\n\r\nHowever, recently we noticed that some GPU backend compiler will capture this behavior (multiple threads writing a same position) as a race condition and thus throw compilation error. The compiler does not take the fact that all values being stored are the same, and insist on complaining.\r\n\r\nThis means that we will still need the write-back block predicate to make things work. And this PR does this change. I have done integration tests locally to make sure that the generated kernels is right and produces the right results numerically.","created_at":"2023-03-05T05:26:16Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T12:50:33Z","closed_at":"2023-03-05T12:50:32Z","merged_at":"2023-03-05T12:50:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"befdc4e63100bdf25b10ae7a54b40408e2e1805a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14199/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14199/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14199/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/9ef8669b15d68aea7891dea7f97b1ae307e1ae97","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-03-05-cross-thread-reduction-wb-predicate","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-03-05-cross-thread-reduction-wb-predicate","sha":"9ef8669b15d68aea7891dea7f97b1ae307e1ae97","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

Previously the translation assumes that the input to Embedding will only be 1-dimensional, and will throw exception when the input has more than one dimension (i.e., batched). This PR brings the support.","created_at":"2023-03-04T22:31:30Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T02:57:39Z","closed_at":"2023-03-05T02:57:38Z","merged_at":"2023-03-05T02:57:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"70ea70f31d0c43a5349344a2f92bf4936bf4e10a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

PR introduces the group normalization high-level operator.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the group normalization operations in frontend models are translated to a series of operations, which brings inconvenience when we want to optimize the group norm op as a whole.\r\n\r\nWith the TOPI implementation of group norm being introduced by https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14193, we can now use it to legalize the high-level group norm op and optimize it using cross-thread reduction or rfactor via MetaSchedule.\r\n\r\nFull implementation credit goes to Bohan.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Bohan Hou

more and more ML models nowadays contain the group normalization computation, we find it beneficial to introduce this op to TOPI level. It will enable us to optimize the group normalization operation as a whole in a more convenient way.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the group normalization op to TOPI. The group norm operation was introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494. The implementation uses tuple reduction, same as the implementation of layer norm. Implemented with tuple reduction, the corresponding generated TIR function can be optimized by cross-thread reduction or rfactor through MetaSchedule.\r\n\r\nFull implementation credit goes to Bohan.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Bohan Hou

the LiftTransformParams pass only works on function `\"main\"`. This is a bit restrictive as in our recent practice on stable diffusion, there are cases where multiple Relax functions inside an IRModule all need to be transformed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR enhances the LiftTransformParams pass, so that it will now transform **all** functions **with attribute `num_input`**. For functions without this attribute, the pass will simply skip them.","created_at":"2023-03-04T17:04:16Z","updated_at":"2023-03-04T18:26:03Z","closed_at":"2023-03-04T18:26:03Z","merged_at":"2023-03-04T18:26:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"81bf98867566d81a6677dbcca9ad5a638a3fbe88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

this moment, the structural hash values of IR in TVM is platform dependent (e.g., the hash values of a String may differ on different platforms). In our recent practice, we found this an obstacle for us to apply one existing database on different platforms (say we tune an IRModule with MetaSchedule on Metal, and then apply the database on CUDA, etc.)\r\n\r\nTo clear this obstacle, we decide to remove the shash value check. The purpose of that check is mainly to ensure safety, and thus turning it off will make no difference in terms of using MetaSchedule in most of the cases that we can imagine.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it is equally important that we need to make our structural hash platform independent. There are plans ongoing for this target.","created_at":"2023-03-04T04:32:35Z","updated_at":"2023-03-04T13:03:49Z","closed_at":"2023-03-04T13:03:49Z","merged_at":"2023-03-04T13:03:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"736cecab3f0ba56a634eecdeb382ea2ba5388a53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14188/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14188/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14188/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/800e6beb5873e96acbc18e4b7bb156b3372eb0f3","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-03-03-turnoffms-db-hash-check","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-03-03-turnoffms-db-hash-check","sha":"800e6beb5873e96acbc18e4b7bb156b3372eb0f3","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

Motivation\r\n`UndefinedVars` is a frequently used function in our codebase and its implementation relies on `VarUseDefAnalysis` class which is more general, currently we expose `UndefinedVars` in `analysis.h`, but both the definitions of `UndefinedVars` and `VarUseDefAnalysis` resides in `split_host_device.cc`.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves `VarUseDefAnalysis` class to `analysis.h` so that developers can use it in other files that requires use/def analysis than `split_host_devices.cc`. We create a `var_use_def_analysis.cc` under `src/src/analysis` for the implementations of both `UndefinedVars` and `VarUseDefAnalysis`.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\nWe rename `VarUseDefAnalysis` to `VarUseDefAnalyzer`.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy

PR introduces a default schedule pass that creates default thread binding for PrimFuncs, including symbolic shape functions so that these PrimFuncs could be built and run on Cuda device. The pass picks out all the blocks inside the PrimFunc and does loop fusion, split and reorder based on the loop extent and target information (max thread block number and max thread per

am trying to add return support from true/false branch of `IfNode` as we discussed in https://github.com/tlc-pack/relax/issues/446. \r\n\r\nI introduced a `RelaxReturnGlobalInfo` (similar to `DummyGlobalInfo`), which is used to save all the `Expr` (`body` of `SeqExpr` ) that need to be returned. But this causes it only works at IR_Module level, it failed to work for relax function without explicitly defining in ir_module. Options I have at this moment.\r\n\r\n- o0: Leverage metadata to save all the return Exprs.\r\n- o1: Introduce GlobalInfo in relax Function level, a new member like `global_info` will be added into FunctionNode\r\n- o2: Add a new member tag `return_body` into `SeqExpr` (we don't  want to change IR at this stage, list it here for consideration in the future)\r\n\r\nAny comments are truly appreciated!  cc: @slyubomirsky  @tqchen  @junrushao @Hzfengsy @YuchenJin\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nupdate:  If a pass modifies the return Expr (for example the original return expr is a CallNode, a var is created and bound to the CallNode in a pass, thus the var is the newly generated return expr), then the globally maintained return exprs should be updated in the pass as well. Looks it burdens the pass writing.

logger related changes in this patch:\r\n* Currently we don't set the output stream on the Python logger, so it defaults to sys.stderr, which means we only get some logger output when the command fails. So set the output stream to sys.stdout\r\n* Currently we can add -v flag to anywhere in the command line for `tvmc compile`, but only between `tvmc` and `run`/`tune` for `run` and `tune`. Unify the behaviour such that we can add the flag anywhere on the command line.\r\n* Set the effective upper bound of `-v`s to 3 as 4 could result in NOTSET which would not output anything.","created_at":"2023-03-02T15:29:37Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T15:33:50Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T15:31:32Z","merged_at":"2023-03-15T15:31:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"f6b75792c5a3ad88ad4819db657c675a6f982ec7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14175/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14175/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14175/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/bcdc81ee50236414001ec01f970add713428051d","head":{"label":"ekalda:fix-tvmc-logger","ref":"fix-tvmc-logger","sha":"bcdc81ee50236414001ec01f970add713428051d","user":{"login":"ekalda","id":15799086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15799086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":215831751,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTU4MzE3NTE=","name":"tvm","full_name":"ekalda/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ekalda","id":15799086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15799086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda/tvm","description":"Open

CUDA: Improved Layout Transform Schedule\r\n\r\n## Summary \r\nThis PR does the following\r\n- Adds a scheduling rule for layout transform operator CUDA target\r\n- Forwards this information by adding \"schedule_rule\" attribute to layout transform topi\r\n- Annotates the layout transform topi with some information needed during scheduling.\r\n\r\nNote: All numbers are on an RTX 3070 unless stated otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe default implementation of layout transform has poor performance in some scenarios. A motivating factor behind all of this were layout transform operators taking up significant time in some stable diffusion models I tried. \r\n\r\nNHWC layout is required for tensor-core use so we had to convert the layout of conv. operators. These introduced layout transform operators and their fused and unfused versions were extremely slow. \r\n\r\nI ended up improving latency by at least 2x for all these operators in this PR:\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n<!--StartFragment--><google-sheets-html-origin><!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\r\n\r\nShape | src_layout | dst_layout | dtype | default (ms) | new_sch (ms)\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n1, 384, 512, 128 | NHWC | NCHW | float16 | 2.32 | 0.247\r\n1, 128, 384, 512 | NCHW | NHWC | float16 | 0.521 | 0.25\r\n1, 576, 384, 256 | NHWC | NCHW | float16 | 6.14 | 0.556\r\n2, 72, 48, 960 | NHWC | NCHW | float16 | 0.217 | 0.067\r\n16, 3456, 3456 | ABC | ACB | float16 | 36.84 | 1.88\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nNow `ncu` states we achieve 90%+ memory throughput on these operators 😎 so we are close to theoretical limit.\r\n\r\n## Algorithm \r\nCurrently, layout transform relies on the AutoBind schedule rule which seems to guarantee contiguous writes to the output buffer when assigning thread and block indices to loops. However in the case of layout transforms where the inner dimensions of `src_layout` and `dst_layout` do not match, it is impossible to have contiguous writes and contiguous reads in the same operation. \r\n\r\nWe ignore the case where the inner dimension matches (though I believe the new schedule might be faster in some scenarios).\r\n\r\n### Simple Case: Transpose\r\nThe way around this is to use a small amount of shared memory and tile loads so that reads from global memory -> shared can be coalesced. We carefully load elements so writing from shared —> global memory also have coalesced access. An example is taking the transpose of the matrix [2048, 1024] —> [1024, 2048]. We can read 32 x 32 tiles of the src matrix. We might make rows of our tile of shared memory correspond to coalesced accesses of the src matrix, then columns of our shared memory tile correspond to coalesced accesses of the dst matrix. By doing this, we can maximize memory throughput of our operations.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13855451/222803863-9b497341-d245-4940-96d2-34ca5dbf13ff.png)\r\n(src: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/efficient-matrix-transpose-cuda-cc/)\r\n\r\n### General Case\r\nWhile a simple transpose is easy to read about, how do we guarantee this behavior for general layout transforms where dimensions can be arbitrarily rearranged? \r\n\r\nWe can have a similar analogue for the general case. Consider the 32 x 32 tile in the previous example. Now we simply want the inner dimension of our title to correspond to the inner dimensions of src_layout and the outer dimension to correspond to the inner dimensions of dst_layout. Then, in the best case both reads and writes to global memory from/to the tile will be coalesced.\r\n\r\nWe factor and split our loops to obtain this desired structure for reads, and then use the loop analysis to guarantee compatible writes automatically.\r\n\r\nAn example is probably best to show this idea:\r\nLet's say we want a layout transform of ABCD --> DCAB. With shape\r\n`[1024_a, 2_b, 32_c, 8_d] --> [8_d, 32_c, 1024_a, 2_b]`\r\n\r\nAnd tile size 32.\r\n\r\nThen we initially have a coalesced-read loop pattern of:\r\n`T.grid(1024_a, 2_b, 32_c, 8_d)`\r\n\r\nTo obtain an inner tile of 32, we factor 4 from 32_c and 8 from 8_d:\r\n`T.grid(1024_a, 2_b, 8_c1, 1_d1, 4_c2t, 8_d2t)`\r\n`T.grid(1024_a, 2_b, 8_cr, 1_dr, 32_dim1)`\r\n\r\nTo obtain an outer tile of 32, we factor from B then A (as the dst_layout is DCAB) to follow contiguous write pattern:\r\n\r\n`T.grid(64_a1, 1_b1, 8_cr, 1_dr, 16_a2t, 2_b2t, 32_dim1)`\r\n`T.grid(64_ar, 1_br, 8_cr, 1_dr, 32_dim0, 32_dim1)`\r\n\r\nWhich allows us to read a tile with our wanted properties.\r\n\r\nWe now have our read and write dimension tiled to get those constraints as close as possible. To handle weirder shapes which don’t divide nicely into tile_size, we pad some dimensions until it divides into tile_size. \r\n\r\n## Choice of search space\r\nCoalesced global memory transactions happen within a warp of which we have a limit of 32 threads. An upper limit of 32 for our tile size is therefore appropriate which is the maximum coalescing possible. In practice we try them all since some tile sizes will divide our dimensions more nicely.\r\n\r\n## Results:\r\nWe present two results in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O7GV50KlJTZ5G7mt9b9qDK2LKoBrImOZRV5Bd8O19p0/edit#gid=1854847295\r\n\r\nOne is obtained by manually invoking the schedule rule and comparing against the default implementation across a variety of tile sizes (8, 16, 32, 64) and shapes + layouts:\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n\r\nSpeedup: |  \r\n-- | --\r\nGeometric Mean: | 3.042796464\r\nMin speedup: | 0.8902785674\r\nMax speedup: | 35.51726767\r\nMedian speedup: | 2.202399163\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nThe other is done similarly but by using the existing autotuning pipeline:\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n\r\nSpeedup |  \r\n-- | --\r\nGeometric Mean | 2.567999905\r\nMean | 4.290743877\r\nMedian | 1.88365594\r\nMin | 0.9612520382\r\nMax | 42.05803413\r\n\r\n<!--EndFragment-->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n## Areas of Future Improvement:\r\nThis is only for weird layouts or weird non-nice shapes. For most common transforms, we now hit 90%+ throughput on ncu.\r\n\r\n### High Shared Memory From Some Tile Sizes\r\n \r\nAnalysis when using `compute_at` seems to fail (or I am missing something) if we sample factors for our inner or outer tile dimension from only the same dimensions for both dim0 and dim1 tiling. This leads to excessive shared memory use in some scenarios which can cause failure or lead to performance issues. A lot of times these are still faster than the default schedules but do use more shared memory than needed. These are a very tiny amount of tested cases however and we always try both the new schedule and AutoBind so it should be ok for now.\r\n\r\nI am not sure why this happens and would need more investigation. An example is transposing [1209, 9] of any type and 32 tile size. \r\n\r\n### Shared memory — Bank Conflicts:\r\n\r\nShared memory bank conflicts exist and are common for the strategy used. Consider a simple transpose of a [2048, 1024] matrix to [1024, 2048]. Then with a tile size of 32, the shared memory buffer will be of shape [32, 32]. We might read from global memory into rows of shared memory, and then write columns of shared memory to global memory for contiguous access. However, note the columns of this shared memory buffer lie on the same memory bank! \r\n\r\nA common solution is to simply pad the innermost dimension of shared memory. E.g. [32, 33]. Which now makes accesses along columns be bank-conflict free.\r\n\r\nThis is planned to be done in a future PR via a new scheduling rule and is a general problem throughout all CUDA generated schedules. To give an idea of impact a [1024, 2048] transpose went from 14.34us —> 12.35us after this change basing off the optimized layout transform described in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Non-aligned inner dimensions:\r\n\r\nThis is an issue I did not think of when writing this schedule. The schedule is done from the viewpoint of trying to maximize coalesced memory access in global memory. However, one small detail is coalesced memory access must be aligned to the size of the transaction. That is, if we have a coalesced access of 64 bytes (e.g. 32 float16’s), then the each address accessed must be on the same 64 byte line (e.g. only the last 6 bits of address may be different). \r\n\r\nConsider a layout transform where dimensions are prime numbers. E.g. [3, 1024, 1024, 7] -> [7, 1024, 1024, 3]. Then the current strategy will read 7 element-wide chunks at a time. However, most accesses will occur across coalesced memory boundaries, resulting in two coalesced memory requests instead of just 1. E.g. let’s say coalesced memory must be 8 byte aligned and we are dealing with one-byte datatype. The first read of 7 elements might be 0x00, 0x01 … 0x07 and the next will be 0x08, 0x09 … 0x0E. For the second access, 0x08 belongs to the first 8-byte line, while 0x09…0x0E belong to the second 8-byte line, requiring two memory transactions.\r\n\r\nOne possible way to get around this is to treat the array as flattened and just access stuff coalesced, though I am not sure about the details, to guarantee good access for src and dst will require some thinking, though it might be possible. \r\n\r\nE.g.\r\nAn interesting thing in this case is if we do the no-op reshape into [3, 1024, 32, 32, 7] and then into [3, 1024, 32, 32 * 7], then [3, 1024, 32, 7, 32]. Then things become obvious. However, trying something like this initially leads to weird calculated bounds in the `compute_at` step and excessive shared memory usage as we must also consider the dst_layout.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-01T23:48:22Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T23:44:17Z","closed_at":"2023-03-23T23:44:17Z","merged_at":"2023-03-23T23:44:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"e5ae4347ddf492a9e017dd1dba47df364a27a197","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/2c1047a05f50421dc36888cfed3405bec03f4883","head":{"label":"AndrewZhaoLuo:aluo/cuda-better-layout-transform","ref":"aluo/cuda-better-layout-transform","sha":"2c1047a05f50421dc36888cfed3405bec03f4883","user":{"login":"AndrewZhaoLuo","id":13855451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13855451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":350495744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTA0OTU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"AndrewZhaoLuo/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndrewZhaoLuo","id":13855451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13855451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo/tvm","description":"Open

PR introduces MemHammer, which performs threadblock level auto data movement in MetaSchedule. The vision that memhammer holds is to free users from laborious manual schedules at threadblock level. With memhammer, the only thing user needs to do is mark a specific block with an annotation `auto_copy`, and memhammer will lower it with auto thread index binding, vectorize, and wmma API calls. We also introduced two new schedule primitives `read_at` and `write_at`, which enable users to perform a cache read / write in an easy-to-use manner, without arduous `cache_read`, `compute_at`, and other manual optimizations.\r\n\r\nGiven a data movement description like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@tvm.script.ir_module\r\nclass GlobalToShared:\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def main(a: T.handle, b: T.handle) -> None:\r\n        A = T.match_buffer(a, [1024, 1024])\r\n        B = T.match_buffer(b, [1024, 1024])\r\n        with T.block(\"root\"):\r\n            T.block_attr({\"warp_execution\": True})\r\n            for bx in T.thread_binding(8, thread=\"blockIdx.x\"):\r\n                for by in T.thread_binding(8, thread=\"blockIdx.y\"):\r\n                    for ty in T.thread_binding(8, thread=\"threadIdx.y\"):\r\n                        with T.block():\r\n                            A_shared_dyn = T.alloc_buffer([128, 128], dtype=\"float32\", scope=\"shared.dyn\")\r\n                            with T.block(\"A_shared\"):\r\n                                T.block_attr({\"auto_copy\": 1, \"vector_bytes\": 16})\r\n                                for ax0, ax1 in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n                                    A_shared_dyn[ax0, ax1] = A[bx * 128 + ax0, by * 128 + ax1]\r\n                            with T.block(\"B\"):\r\n                                for ax0, ax1 in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n                                    B[bx * 128 + ax0, by * 128 + ax1] = A_shared_dyn[ax0, ax1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy annotating the block with `T.block_attr({\"auto_copy\": 1})` and other optional arguments, it will be lowered to the following code with cooperative fetch, vectorize, and other specified features:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@tvm.script.ir_module\r\nclass TransformedGlobalToShared:\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def main(a: T.handle, b: T.handle) -> None:\r\n        A = T.match_buffer(a, [1024,

`tests/python/unittest/test_tir_transform_memhammer_lower_auto_copy.py`.\r\n\r\nAll supported features:\r\n\r\n* Inverse index mapping;\r\n* Coalesced access that auto binds loops to thread index and performs vectorize;\r\n* Add local cache stage;\r\n* Rewrite data movement to wmma fragments with wmma API

Motivation\r\nCurrently, we have schedule primitives `cache_read`/`cache_write`, which allocate cache buffers and create cache stages copying data from the buffer being accessed to the cache buffer. However, `cache_read`/`cache_write` do only support customized indices. For the following block:\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(a: T.handle, b: T.handle) -> None:\r\n    A = T.match_buffer(a, (129, 129))\r\n    B = T.match_buffer(b, (128, 128))\r\n    for i, j in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n        with T.block(\"B\"):\r\n            vi, vj = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i, j])\r\n            B[vi, vj] = A[vi + 1, vj + 1] * 2.0\r\n```\r\nafter `cache_read(\"B\", 0, \"share\")`, we get:\r\n```python\r\n# from tvm.script import tir as T\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef main(A: T.Buffer((129, 129), \"float32\"), B: T.Buffer((128, 128), \"float32\")):\r\n    # with T.block(\"root\"):\r\n    A_shared = T.alloc_buffer((129, 129), scope=\"shared\")\r\n    for ax0, ax1 in T.grid(129, 129):\r\n        with T.block(\"A_shared\"):\r\n            v0, v1 = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [ax0, ax1])\r\n            T.reads(A[v0, v1])\r\n            T.writes(A_shared[v0, v1])\r\n            A_shared[v0, v1] = A[v0, v1]\r\n    for i, j in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n        with T.block(\"B\"):\r\n            vi, vj = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i, j])\r\n            T.reads(A_shared[vi + 1, vj + 1])\r\n            T.writes(B[vi, vj])\r\n            B[vi, vj] = A_shared[vi + 1, vj + 1] * T.float32(2)\r\n```\r\nwhere we access `A_shared` using the same indices(`vi + 1, vj + 1`) as original block, which is not flexible especially we want to do some layout transformation while copying data from original buffer to cache buffer (in MMA tensorization, and in flashattention)\r\n\r\nThis PR propose a new interface that enables us to customize the indices to access the cache buffer, which is expressive enough to describe transposing and blocking.\r\n\r\n# Proposed API\r\n\r\nBelow is the proposed interface of `reindex_cache_read` (`reindex_cache_write` has similar interface):\r\n```python\r\ndef reindex_cache_read(\r\n    self,\r\n    block: Union[BlockRV, str],\r\n    read_buffer_index: int,\r\n    storage_scope: str,\r\n    index_map: Union[IndexMap, Callable],\r\n) -> BlockRV:\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nWhere `block`, `read_buffer_index` and `storage_scope` have the same meaning as in `cache_read`, there is another argument `index_map` specifies what indices to use to access the cache buffer, in the form of a index map that maps current block itervars to target indices. Suppose the block has itervars `vi, vj` and the user wants to access the cache buffer with customized indices `[vi // 16, vj // 16, vi % 16, vj % 16]`, user should set the argument `index_map` to `lambda vi, vj: (vi // 16, vj // 16, vi % 16, vj % 16)`.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\nBy applying `reindex_cache_read(\"B\", 0, lambda i, j: (j, i))` to `func`, we get:\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef main(A: T.Buffer((129, 129), \"float32\"), B: T.Buffer((128, 128), \"float32\")):\r\n    # with T.block(\"root\"):\r\n    A_shared = T.alloc_buffer((128, 128), scope=\"shared\")\r\n    for i, j in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n        with T.block(\"A_shared\"):\r\n            vi, vj = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i, j])\r\n            T.reads(A[vi + 1, vj + 1])\r\n            T.writes(A_shared[vj, vi])\r\n            A_shared[vj, vi] = A[vi + 1, vj + 1]\r\n    for i, j in T.grid(128, 128):\r\n        with T.block(\"B\"):\r\n            vi, vj = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i, j])\r\n            T.reads(A_shared[vj, vi])\r\n            T.writes(B[vi, vj])\r\n            B[vi, vj] = A_shared[vj, vi] * T.float32(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\nUnlike `cache_read`/`cache_write` which allows `cache_read` a rectangle region, we only allows `reindex_cache_read` a single point, but it's enough to cover most use cases.\r\n\r\nThe cache stage block follows the original order of loops and block itervars in the block. If a block itervar does not appear in the buffer access region, it and its corresponding loop variables will be omitted. User can then use `transform_block_layout` primitive to reorder the block itervars and surrounding loops of the cache read/write block.\r\n\r\n# Relations to Existing Schedule Primitives\r\n\r\n- Relation with `reindex`\r\n    - `reindex` only supports the special case of `reindex_cache_read`/`reindex_cache_write`, where`index_map` is the identity map, `reindex` does not have `storage_scope` field.\r\n- Relation with `transform_layout`\r\n    - `transform_layout` is not designed to transform the layout of input buffers instead of intermediate buffers, and does not have a `storage_scope` field.\r\n- Relation with `cache_read/wite`\r\n    - `cache_read`/`cache_write` do not support customized
