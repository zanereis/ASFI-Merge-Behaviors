is ambiguity in the replica fetcher thread's log. When the fetcher thread is handling with offset out of range, it needs to try to truncate the log. When the end offset of the follower replica is greater than the log start offset of the leader replica and smaller than the end offset of the leader replica, the follower replica will maintain its own fetch offset.However, such cases are processed together with cases where the follower replica's end offset is smaller than the leader replica's start offset, resulting in ambiguities in the log, where the follower replica's fetch offset is reported to reset to the leader replica's start offset.In fact, it still maintains its own fetch offset, so this WARN log is misleading to the user.It is more accurate to print this WARN log only when follower replica really need to truncate the fetch offset to the leader replica's log start offset.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10903,\r\nas we konw,if we need sort  the producerBatch by sequence,now we use the new batch compare with the first batch in deque, and if the first batch in deque is less than the new batch,we will loop the deque and let the new batch insert to the right position.and if the new batch is more than the last producerBatch in the deque,we just need add the new batchProducer to the last position in the deque,most of time the deque not exists the mixed producerBatch(has sequence and not has the sequence),so i think this optimize make sense,thank

[KAFKA-10860](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10860) and adds a unit test.\r\n\r\nThe existing code was not easily testable, so refactored to allow the main logic to be executed without invoking `System.exit` or equivalent. The tests added here cover most of the non-connection options, but have to use `--one-time`. I just use the current JVM's MBean server for these tests. Testing the connection code would require spinning up a JVM to connect to, or using the Attach API (which is prevented by https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8180425).\r\n\r\nAlthough `--wait` was described as not supported in the presence of a pattern but this wasn't validated previously. Supporting that actually makes the code simpler by avoiding the need to special-case the presence of a pattern. The semantics are that we wait until each of the given patterns selects at least one `ObjectName`, which is consistent with the behaviour for a non-patterned `--wait`.","created_at":"2021-01-05T11:37:32Z","updated_at":"2023-04-17T09:22:17Z","closed_at":"2023-04-17T09:22:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2b50fd5d1504719593ce0fab1ab080ec59b061b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9822/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9822/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9822/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d5b9ec4d636b255f4d1e2e98f4367196789e27e8","head":{"label":"tombentley:KAFKA-10860-jmxtool-npe","ref":"KAFKA-10860-jmxtool-npe","sha":"d5b9ec4d636b255f4d1e2e98f4367196789e27e8","user":{"login":"tombentley","id":879487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTQ4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/879487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley","html_url":"https://github.com/tombentley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":93850932,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Mzg1MDkzMg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"tombentley/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tombentley","id":879487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTQ4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/879487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley","html_url":"https://github.com/tombentley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombentley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tombentley/kafka","description":"Mirror

support for nonzero log start offsets.\r\n\r\nChanges to `Log`:\r\n1. Add a new \"reason\" for increasing the log start offset. This is used by `KafkaMetadataLog` when a snapshot is generated.\r\n2. `LogAppendInfo` should return if it was rolled because of an records append. A log is rolled when a new segment is created. This is used by `KafkaMetadataLog` to in some cases delete the created segment based on the log start offset.\r\n\r\nChanges to `KafkaMetadataLog`:\r\n1. Update both append functions to delete old segments based on the log start offset whenever the log is rolled.\r\n2. Update `lastFetchedEpoch` to return the epoch of the latest snapshot whenever the log is empty.\r\n3. Add a function that empties the log whenever the latest snapshot is greater than the replicated log. This is used when first loading the `KafkaMetadataLog` and whenever the `KafkaRaftClient` downloads a snapshot from the leader.\r\n\r\nChanges to `KafkaRaftClient`:\r\n1. Improve `validateFetchOffsetAndEpoch` so that it can handle fetch offset and last fetched epoch that are smaller than the log start offset. This is in addition to the existing code that check for a diverging log. This is used by the raft client to determine if the Fetch response should include a diverging epoch or a snapshot id. \r\n2. When a follower finishes fetching a snapshot from the leader fully truncate the local log.\r\n3. When polling the current state the raft client should check if the state machine has generated a new snapshot and update the log start offset accordingly.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

processed by the controller and topics newly created will only be given topic IDs if the inter-broker protocol version on the controller is greater than 2.8. This PR also adds a kafka config to specify whether the IBP is greater or equal to 2.8. System tests have been modified to include topic ID checks for upgrade/downgrade tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a new integration test file for requests/responses that are not gated by IBP (ex: metadata) This file can be expanded to check topic IDs are handled correctly when the request/response version uses topic IDs but the brokers are not able to handle them.\r\n\r\n### Committer

i support to the \"stop\" scripts was added in a previous PR (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9023), but it misses cases where certain service managers dispatch the zookeeper/kafka jobs with

Problem\r\n\r\nIf a connector, converter, etc. invokes [Configuration::setConfiguration](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/security/auth/login/Configuration.html#setConfiguration-javax.security.auth.login.Configuration-), it will cause the Connect basic auth filter to use that JAAS config instead of the one configured at startup with the `-Djava.security.auth.login.config` JVM property. This can cause requests to the worker to succeed initially but start to be rejected after the JVM's global JAAS config is altered.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nCache the JVM's global JAAS configuration as soon as possible (in this case, as soon as the `BasicAuthSecurityRestExtension` class is loaded), and use that for all future authentication. It's still possible that a different JAAS config than the one that the JVM was configured to use on startup will be captured at this point, but the chances of that should be very slim since it would require a plugin class to install a new global JAAS config as soon as it was loaded. Even if that does happen, this should at the very least guarantee consistent behavior on the worker--any request that succeeds once will always succeed, as opposed to the current situation where requests can succeed for a little bit but then start to get inexplicably rejected after a little while when a plugin class chooses to install a new global JAAS config.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nExisting tests for the JAAS basic auth filter are modified to work with the new internal logic. The `testEmptyCredentialsFile` test is corrected to actually operate on an empty credentials file (instead of a non-existent credentials file, which it currently operates on). A new test is added to ensure that, even if the global JAAS config is overwritten, the basic auth filter will use the first one it could find.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

the control plane to be safe and stable.\r\n\r\nAt present,data requests and control requests use different endpoints,these endpoints are all registered with ZooKeeper.This results in the client business still having access to the metadata that controls the endpoint,this returns the control endpoint back to the data endpoint.One option is to turn on the firewall to disable client access to the control port.But does Kafka need to do something on its own to handle data request access control endpoints to deny those requests.I modified part of the code to deny access control endpoints for data requests.This is the first time I've submitted code to the community,I hope to get some advice, if possible, I will continue to work on

existing `Kafka*BackingStore` classes used by Connect all use `KafkaBasedLog`, which needs to frequently get the end offsets for the internal topic to know whether they are caught up. `KafkaBasedLog` uses its consumer to get the end offsets and to consume the records from the topic.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Connect internal topics are often written very infrequently. This means that when the `KafkaBasedLog` used in the `Kafka*BackingStore` classes is already caught up and its last consumer poll is waiting for new records to appear, the call to the consumer to fetch end offsets will block until the consumer returns after a new record is written (unlikely) or the consumer’s `fetch.max.wait.ms` setting (defaults to 500ms) ends and the consumer returns no more records. IOW, the call to `KafkaBasedLog.readToEnd()` may block for some period of time even though it’s already caught up to the end.\r\n\r\nInstead, we want the `KafkaBasedLog.readToEnd()` to always return quickly when the log is already caught up. The best way to do this is to have the `KafkaBackingStore` use the admin client (rather than the consumer) to fetch end offsets for the internal topic. The consumer and the admin API both use the same `ListOffset` broker API, so the functionality is ultimately the same but we don't have to block for any ongoing consumer activity.\r\n\r\nEach Connect distributed runtime includes three instances of the `Kafka*BackingStore` classes, which means we have three instances of `KafkaBasedLog`. We don't want three instances of the admin client, and should have all three instances of the `KafkaBasedLog` share a single admin client instance. In fact, each `Kafka*BackingStore` instance currently creates, uses and closes an admin client instance when it checks and initializes that store's internal topic. If we change `Kafka*BackingStores` to share one admin client instance, we can change that initialization logic to also reuse the supplied admin client instance.\r\n\r\nThe final challenge is that `KafkaBasedLog` has been used by projects outside of Apache Kafka. While `KafkaBasedLog` is definitely not in the public API for Connect, we can make these changes in ways that are backward compatible: create new constructors and deprecate the old constructors. Connect can be changed to only use the new constructors, and this will give time for any downstream users to make changes.\r\n\r\nThese changes are implemented as follows:\r\n1. Add a `KafkaBasedLog` constructor to accept in its parameters a supplier from which it can get an admin instance, and deprecate the old constructor. We need a supplier rather than just passing an instance because `KafkaBasedLog` is instantiated before Connect starts up, so we need to create the admin instance only when needed. At the same time, we'll change the existing init function parameter from a no-arg function to accept an admin instance as an argument, allowing that init function to reuse the shared admin instance used by the `KafkaBasedLog`. Note: if no admin supplier is provided (in deprecated constructor that is no longer used in AK), the consumer is still used to get latest offsets.\r\n2. Add to the `Kafka*BackingStore` classes a new constructor with the same parameters but with an admin supplier, and deprecate the old constructor. When the classes instantiate its `KafkaBasedLog` instance, it would pass the admin supplier and pass an init function that takes an admin instance.\r\n3. Create a new `SharedTopicAdmin` that lazily creates the `TopicAdmin` (and underlying Admin client) when required, and closes the admin objects when the `SharedTopicAdmin` is closed.\r\n4. Modify the existing `TopicAdmin` (used only in Connect) to encapsulate the logic of fetching end offsets using the admin client, simplifying the logic in `KafkaBasedLog` mentioned in #1 above. Doing this also makes it easier to test that logic.\r\n5. Change `ConnectDistributed` to create a `SharedTopicAdmin` instance (that is `AutoCloseable`) before creating the `Kafka*BackingStore` instances, passing the `SharedTopicAdmin` (which is an admin supplier) to all three `Kafka*BackingStore objects`, and finally always closing the `SharedTopicAdmin` upon termination. (Shutdown of the worker occurs outside of the `ConnectDistributed` code, so modify `DistributedHerder` to take in its constructor additional `AutoCloseable` objects that should be closed when the herder is closed, and then modify `ConnectDistributed` to pass the `SharedTopicAdmin` as one of those `AutoCloseable` instances.)\r\n6. Change `MirrorMaker` similarly to `ConnectDistributed`.\r\n7. Change existing unit tests to no longer use deprecated constructors.\r\n8. Add unit tests for new functionality.\r\n\r\nThis change should be backported to fix the bug in recent releases.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

After checking the test, I found the test is expected to be slow because it tests `we can consume all partitions if fetch.max.bytes and max.partition.fetch.bytes are low`. So I think the test has no bug, just need more time. \r\n\r\nWhat I did are:\r\n1. reduce the record size for each partition (from 15 -> 10), it should speed up the test, but also be able to test the original scenario\r\n2. increase the timeout value (from 60 sec -> 90 sec)\r\n\r\nHope this can makes the test more reliable!\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

two cooperative rebalances take place soon after one another, a prior rebalance may not complete before the next rebalance is started.\r\nUnder Eager rebalancing, no tasks would have been started, so the subsequent onRevoked call is intentionally skipped whenever rebalanceResolved was false.\r\nUnder Cooperative rebalancing, the same logic causes the DistributedHerder to skip stopping all of the connector/task revocations which occur in the second rebalance.\r\nThe DistributedHerder still removes the revoked connectors/tasks from its assignment, so that the DistributedHerder and Worker have different knowledge of running connectors/tasks.\r\nThis causes the connector/task instances that would have been stopped to disappear from the rebalance protocol, and left running until their workers are halted, or they fail.\r\nConnectors/Tasks which were then reassigned to other workers by the rebalance protocol would be duplicated, and run concurrently with zombie connectors/tasks.\r\nConnectors/Tasks which were reassigned back to the same worker would encounter exceptions in Worker, indicating that the connector/task existed and was already running.\r\n\r\n* Add a test for revoking and then reassigning a connector under normal circumstances\r\n* Add a test for revoking and then reassigning a connector following an incomplete cooperative rebalance\r\n* Change expectRebalance to make assignment fields mutable before passing them into the DistributedHerder\r\n* Only skip revocation for the Eager protocol, and never skip revocation for cooperative/sessioned protocols\r\n\r\nThis should be backported to all branches with Incremental Cooperative Rebalancing, 2.3+ if possible. This is a serious consistency bug, and the fix should probably be applied widely.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Greg Harris <gregh@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

wasn't able to reproduce the failure locally, but it looks like there is a race condition with the sending of the records in the first producer. The test case assumes that these records have been completed before the call to `sendOffsetsToTransaction`, but they very well might not be. It is even possible for the writes from the second producer to arrive first which would then result in the test failure that we are seeing. The solution is to force the send with `flush()`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

flaky test is because we expected our last(6th) connection will be the one connection who got throttled, but this is not true. The reason is: \r\n(1)  `selector.select()` will return the channels that are ready, so the last connection might not get ready in the last\r\n(2) the `selector.selectedKeys()` returns `Set<SelectionKey>`, and the data structure `Set` doesn't provide any ordering guarantees\r\n\r\nSo, to fix it, in the setup phase, I created (maximum allowable number + 1) of connections, and make sure there's 1 connection throttled. And then, we can make sure the next connection will also get throttled( of course the time is not ticking due to we use `MockTime`), so that we can make the tests more reliable. \r\n\r\n### Committer
