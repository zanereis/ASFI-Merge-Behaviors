Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8304 Updates `TestListenTCPRecord` to call `TestRunner.run()` until reporting the expected number of files transferred to the success relationship.  This approach invokes `ListenTCPRecord.onTrigger()` causing the processor to poll the queue for available messages.  Changes also include introducing a 30 second timeout for test methods to ensure that failures will not loop indefinitely.  Each iteration also checks for error log messages that will break the loop with an informational failure message should the processor fail to handle records.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe KafkaRecordSink implementations used to send all records in the RecordSet as one Kafka message. Because of Kafka message size constraints, this can make the sinks unusable for things like Provenance (when all provenance events are in a single RecordSet). Instead this PR sends each record as a separate Kafka message.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-16T14:27:59Z","updated_at":"2023-05-24T08:43:48Z","closed_at":"2023-05-24T08:43:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8999bb93e44be54e2941bf891f6b79b41400eed8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/93bd493e2830390aa4507d82e3466e5f0094f3ab","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-8326","ref":"NIFI-8326","sha":"93bd493e2830390aa4507d82e3466e5f0094f3ab","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8304-2 Improves the reliability of the following test classes:\r\n\r\n- TestListenRELP\r\n- TestListenTCP\r\n- TestListenUDP\r\n- TestPutTCP\r\n- TestListenTCPRecord\r\n\r\nChanges include replacing the `OnUnscheduled` annotation with `OnStopped` in `AbstractEventListenProcessor` in order to follow the convention of other listening processors and standardize testing.  Unit test changes include refactoring the listed classes to use the `TestRunner.run()` methods instead of calling processor methods directly.  Updates also simplify test client code by replacing internal loops with calls to `TestRunner.run()` based on the number of messages expected.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8319 Adds `AES_CBC_NO_PADDING` as a new `Encryption Algorithm` property in `EncryptContent` limited to decryption mode.  AES-CBC is not recommend for encryption operation due to potential vulnerabilities related to padding, as well as the lack of integrity protection as supported in AES-GCM.  Supporting `AES/CBC/NoPadding` for decryption allows for integration with external services that use this particular cipher configuration.\r\n\r\nChanges include updates to the `EncryptionMethod` enumeration as well as unit test modifications to confirm support for decryption in `EncryptContent`.  Other unit test changes include using a plaintext value with a size that is a multiple of 16 in order for existing tests to work without padding.  \r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8304 Refactors unit tests for `InvokeHTTP` to a single class implemented using OkHttp MockWebServer.  This approach removes the duplicative execution of multiple unit test classes for TLS communication and includes both HTTP and HTTPS unit tests in a single class.  MockWebServer replaces the test instance of Jetty Server, reducing the amount of code needed to prepare various types of HTTP responses.  Changes to `InvokeHTTP` include code cleanup for several unused properties as well as replacing Joda Time with `java.time` for date formatting and replacing Guava `Files` with `java.nio.file.Files` for creating the ETag cache directory.  Additional changes include updates to `PutTCP` unit tests, lengthening the timeout for testing the connection per FlowFile property and also closing connection sockets per message for that particular unit test method.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nisIntegerCompatible() was letting \"too large\" values be compatible with integers. This causes downstream issues when the value is to be written as an integer (i.e. if the schema is inferred to be of Integer type rather than Long, etc.).\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

on the finding of @jfrazee I adjusted the behaviour of the rollover mechanism. This involves two things:\r\n- Decision process for leftover partitions now involves the server's timezone (the actual partitions are bound to UTC, thus there might be an overflow at the beginning/end of the day based on the timezone)\r\n- I added a safeguard for not removing the \"active partition\" in cases where the NiFi is stopped with existing storage repository and restarted after more time than time the repository should cover.\r\n\r\nI also adjusted the tests accordingly. Now we have explicit tests for timezones with positive and negative offset.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8298 Refactors Kerberos and SSLSocket classes from `nifi-security-utils` to separate modules that do not depend on the Bouncy Castle Security Provider library.  This refactoring reduces the size of the assembled NiFi binary by almost 300 MB due to the elimination of over 30 references to bcprov-jdk15on.  This PR includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Created `nifi-security-socket-ssl`\r\n- Created `nifi-security-kerberos`\r\n- Removed `nifi-security-utils` dependency from `nifi-processor-utils`\r\n- Updated modules to reference new dependencies\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8304 Introduces a configured QueuedThreadPool with a maximum of eight threads for running unit tests for InvokeHTTP.  Multiple executions of the GitHub CI runner on JDK 11 succeeded after this change, as opposed to a number of recent failures in the SSL versions of the InvokeHTTP unit tests.  The default minimum number of threads for Jetty is eight, so this change brings the maximum number in line with the minimum, reducing it from the default value of 200.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8302 Corrects `FingerprintFactory.getLoggableRepresentationOfSensitiveValue()` to call the private `decrypt()` method to remove the prefix and suffix from the encrypted value prior to calling `PropertyEncryptor.decrypt()`.  Changes include updates to the `FingerprintFactoryTest` to perform hexadecimal encoding and decoding in order to provide basic verification of processing.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8288 Removes `nifi-security-utils` dependency from `nifi-web-utils` and eliminates the need for `OkHttpClientUtils`.  This refactor removes around 40 MB of dependencies of the assembled NiFi binary as a result of removing unnecessary references to the Bouncy Castle Security Provider.  Other changes include the following:\r\n\r\n- Added createTrustManager() on SSLContextService\r\n- Removed OkHttpClientUtils in favor of direct use of SSLContextService and SslContextFactory\r\n- Removed nifi-security-utils and okhttp dependencies from nifi-web-utils\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issues described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-8286. It enables parsing of subject distinguished names which contain an embedded emailAddress attribute, which is a valid (though legacy) way to define a subject according to RFC5280.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe nifi-lumberjack-nar component(s) were deprecated in favor of the nifi-beats-nar components. Now that the nifi-beats-nar is no longer included in the Apache NiFi convenience binary, we shouldn't include the lumberjack NAR either. Both will still be available in the Apache release Maven repository, they just need to be downloaded separately from the convenience binary. This is to help reduce the size of the release binary.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nSplits assembly NARs into multiple profiles so they can be disabled when building. Due to the infamous [MNG-4917](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-4917), even though they are activated by default, we'd need to change our Github Actions workflow to activate them anyway since we also activate `contrib-check` and `include-grpc` profiles.\r\n\r\nThis PR also moves the deprecated Lumberjack NAR out to a profile (disabled by default). I think this was overlooked when the Beats NAR was removed from the assembly altogether. I'm keeping it in this PR only for discussion, I think we should remove that NAR too (it will still be available for download, just not available to be built into the assembly)\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdds a try/catch around blob.free() as a driver may throw a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException. Other exceptions/errors are not caught (such as the jTDS driver not implementing the free() method at all) as they indicate driver issues/incompatibilities and not NiFi's adherence to the JDBC spec.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe `properties` object of a created Controller Service was populated with null values rather than default values. This causes a property dependent on the default value of another property to be hidden when instead it should be displayed. This PR populates the property value based on the property's default value.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis continues #4637, copying the description:\r\n\r\nThis resolves a few pain points related to the `DataDogReportingTask` that we've been hearing from customers, tracked in the following tickets:\r\n\r\n* [NIFI-4713](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4713) - Processor name shouldn't be embedded into metric name\r\n* [NIFI-5535](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-5535) - Reporting task generates too many custom metrics (due to metric names and tags)\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following changes (unchecked items still TODO):\r\n\r\n* [x]  Remove all tags from metrics except from `env` (for all metrics) and `processor` (for processor metrics only).\r\n* [x]  Drop the processor name from the name of metrics (eg `nifi.exampleProcessor.FlowFilesReceivedLast5Minutes` -> `nifi.FlowFilesReceivedLast5Minutes`, and `nifi.flow.ActiveThreads` -> `nifi.ActiveThreads`) and submit it as a tag\r\n\r\nThese changes are so that the `DataDogReporting` task plays better with Datadog, in particular:\r\n\r\n* Allow users to use native functionality allowed by tagging, such as filtering, grouping, etc.\r\n* Remove drastically the amount of `metric x tags` possible values, in order to reduce the number of custom metrics this reporting task generates. Now number of custom metrics is `23 + 6 * num_processors`, instead of potentially thousands or more.\r\n\r\n**Note**: a natural follow-up to this PR would be to implement a configuration mechanism so that users have better control on what groups of metrics they'd like to collect. These groups would probably be: `processors`, `connection_statuses`, `input_port_statuses`, `output_port_statuses`, `jvm`, and `data_flow`. This has been requested in both NIFI-4713 and NIFI-5535, and would allow users to reduce even more the number of custom metrics so that only what they need is pushed to Datadog. This is completely orthogonal to what this PR focuses on: it won't require any changes to the metric names, values, or tags. So I'm keeping this for a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n* [x]  Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8230 Removes the default internal Sensitive Properties Key which provided fallback support when the value of `nifi.sensitive.props.key` was empty.  NiFi used the default internal value on new installations where the administrator had not configured a sensitive properties key.\r\n\r\nTo maintain ease of use, this PR includes an update to `NiFiPropertiesLoader.get()` that checks for a null or blank sensitive properties key and generates a random key when the flow configuration file is not found.  The random key generation process uses `java.util.SecureRandom` to generate an array of 24 bytes, which is then encoded using Base64 without padding to produce a 32 character string.  Using Base64 without padding avoids introducing unsupported property characters while also providing a reasonable range of potential random characters.\r\n\r\nThis approach supports generating a random key for installations of NiFi while avoiding random generation when upgrading.  Existing flow configurations may already contain sensitive properties encrypted with the default internal key.  For upgrades of existing installations that do not have a sensitive properties key, NiFi logs and error and throws an exception referencing the Administration Guide section on _Migrating a Flow with Sensitive Properties_.  To support migration, the `ConfigEncryptionTool` retains the default internal value for reading existing flows.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nRather than getting the component's supported properties and validating them using a context that may or may not have the same properties, this change just iterates over the context's properties and validates those. 99% of the time the properties match, but for scripted components that can add properties once the script is loaded, it was causing a NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8264 Excludes Apache `commons-logging` from several dependencies in framework modules and includes `jcl-over-slf4j` to provide consistent runtime logging behavior.  The root Maven configuration referenced to a non-existent `ch.qos.logback:jcl-over-slf4j` module, which this PR removes.  The following dependencies had a transitive dependency on `commons-logging` which resulted in `commons-logging` being included in `nifi-framework-nar`:\r\n\r\n- org.apache.commons:commons-configuration2\r\n- org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient\r\n- org.apache.httpcomponents:httpasyncclient\r\n- org.springframework.security:spring-security-saml2-core\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-25T18:49:08Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T20:19:47Z","closed_at":"2021-03-01T20:19:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06536d3ed007ef6886561bca3f73fe0f96298c57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4848/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4848/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4848/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/0b7b33cd65d2a3b38754e657009abe302fc59d14","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-8264","ref":"NIFI-8264","sha":"0b7b33cd65d2a3b38754e657009abe302fc59d14","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8251 Adds the following Processors and Controller Services in a new `nifi-pgp-bundle` and related modules:\r\n\r\n- EncryptContentPGP\r\n- DecryptContentPGP\r\n- StandardPGPPrivateKeyService\r\n- StandardPGPPublicKeyService\r\n\r\nThe new components address a number of latent issues related to PGP handling in the `EncryptContent` Processor:\r\n\r\n- NIFI-7396 EncryptContentPGP writes encryption metadata attributes\r\n- NIFI-6708 Controller Services support ElGamal Public and Private Keys\r\n- NIFI-5346 Controller Services support Keyring Files and ASCII Key properties\r\n- NIFI-5335 Controller Services support multiple public or private keys from keyrings\r\n- NIFI-2983 DecryptContentPGP finds and decrypts Encrypted Data Packets regardless of signing\r\n- NIFI-1694 Controller Services support individual key files or keyrings\r\n\r\nThe EncryptContentPGP Processor supports several configuration properties that were previously hard-coded in `EncryptContent`:\r\n\r\n- File Encoding either Binary or ASCII Armor\r\n- Compression Algorithm\r\n\r\nThe EncryptContentPGP supports AES or Camellia Symmetric-Key Algorithms with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256.  Support for other algorithms is not included in this initial version in order to discourage the use of less secure algorithms.  When configured with a PGPPublicKeyService, the EncryptContentPGP Processor requires the presence of a Public Key ID formatted using the long format as a 16 character hexadecimal string.  This approach provides direct control over which key to use for encryption and also supports both RSA and ElGamal Public Keys.\r\n\r\nThe DecryptContentPGP Processor is capable of reading messages encrypted using any of the Symmetric-Key Algorithms supported in the BouncyCastle library.  The DecryptContentPGP Processor supports reading either binary or ASCII Armor encoded messages through content detection and also handles standard compression algorithms.  In addition, the DecryptContentPGP Processor is capable of handling signed messages and decrypting the contents.  Additional efforts to support signature verification can be implemented as separate processors under NIFI-7322.  The DecryptContentPGP Processor can be configured to read messages encrypted with either Password-Based Encryption or Public Key Encryption when configured with the necessary properties.  The Processor leverages the PGPPrivateKeyService to find associated Private Keys when processing messages encrypted using Public Key Encryption.\r\n\r\nThe PGP Controller Services abstract access to Public and Private Key files.  Both services support binary or ASCII Armor keyrings, as well as the option to provide an ASCII Armored keyring as a property.  Public Keys are not considered sensitive, whereas Private Keys are considered sensitive and encrypted using standard NiFi Sensitive Properties encryption.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

this review is a successor of [PR 4821](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4821). In order to keep the changes readable I decided to abandon that one and start a fresh pull request._\r\n\r\nThis would be a proposal for having persistent status history for both component and node level metrics. I decided to approach the question using `QuestDB` which is an embeddable time series database written in Java. During my tests, the performance and the memory footprint are looked reasonable.\r\n\r\nAs for code organisation of the new implementation I worked with three concepts: repository is the top level entity, provides the service for the clients (`FlowController`, etc.). In general, this is the same as before, with minor changes (the name has been changed to `StatusHistoryRepostiory` to server the intent better, also start and stop hooks were added). The storage classes are part of the repositories and are responsible for manage the details of a given type, like processor status, node status, etc. Finally the `WriterTemplates` and `ReaderTemplates` are merely helpers exist to deal with `QuestDB` API calls.\r\n\r\nSome remarks on design decisions:\r\n\r\n- The PR contains a small fix on ProcessGroupStatusDescriptor#calculateTaskMillis(): previously every subsequent level makes a nano->milli conversion, which accumulates, reducing the task time in children groups into 0. Now this should be fixed (The QuestDB tests are implicitly proves this as well)\r\n- Configuration contains the new parameters but they are commented out. These are relevant for the QuestDB implementation and if not used the implementation will go with default values. At this point I think, the VolatileComponentStatusRepository should be kept as default implementation\r\n- The implementation depends on the latest of the 4.X version of QuestDB. Currently QuestDB is at 5.0.5, but the 5.X line depends on Java 11. There are some non vital features in 5.X (all_tables request, dropping partition using WHERE closure), but these are not unavoidable for us.\r\n- QuestDB can be called using `PostrgeSQL` driver via `JDBC` if it is not embedded. Also it provides supports `InfluxDB` protocol. These are possibilities were not utilised: QuestDB's own API seems to be sufficient and robust for our purposes.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nCSVReader provides option to allow/reject duplicate header names in CSV files.\r\n\r\nRe-instates the ability for the Apache Commons CSV Parser to reject such CSV files (the library functionality changes between version 1.6 and 1.8, but NiFi didn't account for that when upgrading the dependency).\r\n\r\nAdds the ability for the Jackson CSV Parser to also detect and reject duplicate header names (although that doesn't appear to be a JAckson-native capability).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- ~[ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?~\r\n- ~[ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?~\r\n- ~[ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?~\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- ~[ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8037 Updates `StandardSSLContextService` and `StandardRestrictedSSLContextService` to use the internal `TlsPlatform.getSupportedProtocols()` method to determine which protocol versions are supported as allowable values for the `TLS Protocol` property.  This approach uses runtime detection of supported protocol versions, which allows for selecting `TLSv1.3` when it is available on supported versions of Java 8 and higher.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that various processors use `SSLContextService` in different ways, so separate work may be needed in order for particular processors to honor the `TLS Protocol` property.  This PR includes unit test updates to ensure that an `SSLContext` can be constructed using preferred protocols as indicated from the `TlsPlatform` class.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-5623 Upgrades OkHttp3 to version 4.9.1 and updates several unit tests to work with the new version.\r\n\r\n- Created `okhttp.version` property in root Maven configuration to reflect version used in NiFi framework components\r\n- Refactored unit test for `HttpNotificationService` to remove unnecessary test methods and streamline testing approach\r\n- `HttpNotificationServiceTest` includes URL property creation to work on all platforms following OkHttp version updates for OkHttp `MockWebServer`, and also removes the need for binary JKS files in `nifi-bootstrap` test resources\r\n- Preserved OkHttp version override in `nifi-toolkit-api` to maintain support for generated classes\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\n(See also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-8219)\r\n\r\n*Persistent memory (PMEM) is non-volatile and byte-addressable memory installed into DIMM slots. With Filesystem DAX (Direct Access) and PMDK (Persistent Memory Development Kit), a program can map on-PMEM files to userspace then read and write its data, bypassing page caches. These technologies could bring you better I/O performance than traditional disks.*\r\n\r\n*I would propose a patchset which lets FlowFile, Content, and Provenance Repositories use PMDK (via JNI) to write their data to their files shown as follows:*\r\n\r\n* *FlowFile Repository: Journals (.journal)*\r\n* *Content Repository: Content/Resource Claims*\r\n* *Provenance Repository: Provenance logs (.prov) and ToCs (.toc)*\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you to ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

would be a proposal for having persistent status history for both component and node level metrics. During the implementation I tried to balance between introducing some flexibility in usage and supporting the existing behaviour. As an end result, I did split the component status repository (now it is StatusRepository) into one which is responsible for component metrics and an other responsible for node level metrics. They might be configured independently on some level (like it is possible to store data into a different storage or for a different amount of time window), but in order to support the previous configuration, there is a facade for them which provides the same composite service as it did before (component and node).\r\n\r\nAs for code organisational part I worked with three concepts: repository is the top level entity, provides the service for the clients (FlowController, etc.). In general, this is the same as before, only split into two parts: node and component. The storage classes are part of the repositories and are responsible for manage the details of a given type, like processor status, node status, etc. Finally the WriterTemplates and ReaderTemplates are merely helpers exist to deal with QuestDB API calls.\r\n\r\nSome remarks on design decisions:\r\n- I kept the name for VolatileComponentStatusRepository, but the actual repositories are using the prefix InMemory to show more contrast with QuestDB\r\n- The PR contains a small fix on ProcessGroupStatusDescriptor#calculateTaskMillis(): previously every subsequent level makes a nano->milli conversion, which accumulates, reducing the task time in children groups into 0. Now this should be fixed (The QuestDB tests are implicitly proves this as well)\r\n- Configuration contains the new parameters but they are commented out. At this point I think, the VolatileComponentStatusRepository should be kept as default\r\n- The implementation depends on the latest of the 4.X version of QuestDB. Currently QuestDB is at 5.0.5, but the 5.X line depends on Java 11. There are some non vital features in 5.X (all_tables request, dropping partition using WHERE closure), but these are not unavoidable for us.\r\n\r\nThank you for investing your time to my PR!\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nInstead of always using the field datatype when calling setObject() for the prepared statement, use the column datatype and convert the value as necessary.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as
