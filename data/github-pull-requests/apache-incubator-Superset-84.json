change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\"undefined undefined\" was showing up in the owners list of a report every time it was edited. This was resolved by setting the `owners` data to match the state in `alert` (straight from redux state) instead of `resource` (coming from the alert fetch logic). Since `resource` is manipulated in the update, sometimes `owners` will be a list of owner IDs with no other data. This caused the label to return \"undefined\" for `first_name` and `last_name` in the `owners` object when it's updated. `alert`'s state, however, consistently has the entire `owners` object. It now updates appropriately when updating the owners on a report.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### BEFORE\r\n![d08ac168-13e7-44b3-9fab-52994186c68b-hs_file_upload-report_bug (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/138965257-a43ea3f1-4fed-4a96-b353-11197835bc42.png)\r\n\r\n#### AFTER\r\n![definedOwners](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/138965624-c29855c2-60d7-46e7-9c6b-8247751b44e1.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is the implementation of SIP -76 #17210 - feat for dynamic loading of dashboard components\r\n\r\n**Why?**\r\n\r\nDependent on product needs we want to take development of Superset to different directions. `Dashboard Components` can introduce specific needs of company requirements. So we wanted to do this feature more flexible in order to not affect other product visions :)\r\n\r\n**What?**\r\n\r\nThis PR add opportunity to add new `Dashboard Components` that can be configured in separate file by every superset instance and not affects main Superset functionality. Commonly needed types relating to the Dashboard are also moved into `@superset-ui/core` to make it possible to fully decouple dashboard component plugin development from the Superset codebase.\r\n\r\n**How?**\r\n\r\nWe creating new dashboard components registry that can register new `Dashboard Components`  in `/src/setup/setupDasboardComponents.ts`. In a follow-up PR, this code will be moved into a Yeoman generator template.\r\n\r\nWhen we drag new component to dashboard we use `React.lazy` function to load code of component\r\n\r\n**NOTES:**\r\n- We created new type of registry using functional approach in favor of  class approach that we are using now for loading plugin charts\r\n- We have some basic predefined rules for dynamic components\r\n- To test existing functionality you need uncomment code in file `superset-frontend/src/setup/setupDasboardComponents.ts` and it will add demo component to list of components\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56388545/138594705-32b5a862-295f-4111-a63b-d8e8c96fcb7e.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

upgrade, we inadvertently lost the inclusion of the terser plugin due to the way the CssMinimizerPlugin was loaded. This PR uses webpack's `...` syntax to extend existing minimizers and ADD the CssMinimizerPlugin on top of the default terser plugin, rather than it being the ONLY minimizer.\r\n\r\nThis should shrink the JS bundle/chunk sizes by about 17MB in total.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThere could be some instances where ad-hoc metrics for specific datasets should be disabled, i.e., the dataset owner specifically does not want users to create ad-hoc non-sanctioned metrics. This PR adds‚Äîat the dataset level‚Äîa custom override for disabling ad-hoc metrics, i.e., removing the `SIMPLE` and `CUSTOM SQL` tabs. The default behavior preserves the existing workflow.\r\n\r\nNote if this override is enabled, any existing ad-hoc metric will persist and be deemed editable even though the tab is officially marked as disabled. \r\n\r\nFor consistency, for the native Druid connector I also disabled the `CUSTOM SQL` tab (which housed a message as to why this was invalid‚Äîthis proposed way seems cleaner as well) and added the same treatment for ad-hoc filters.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Disallowed\r\n\r\n<img width=\"343\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-11-05 at 11 33 31 AM\"

SUMMARY\r\nBefore, when a custom metric that was currently selected got removed from dataset, all selected metrics where cleared and user had to rebuild their chart.\r\nThis PR fixes that behaviour by removing from metrics picker only those custom metrics that were removed from dataset. Also, if user removes a column from dataset, the adhoc metrics that use that column will also be removed.\r\nAlso, it fixes another bug that's been around for long time - now adhoc metric labels display column's verbose name as a default label rather than it's name from database.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked

SUMMARY\r\nWhen limiting a query with top n series on a db that doesn't support subqueries (e.g. Druid), numeric values are sometimes returned as `numpy` types. For instance, integer values are returned as `numpy.int64` instead of `int`. If the groupby column type is set to String type, despite the expression returning a numeric value, this causes the following SQLAlchemy compilation error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/138414120-e4bce69e-e827-4ab3-aab8-8a7c9fa64272.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/138413412-af5a3717-6294-4428-b436-f8f558dd5a9d.png)\r\n\r\nThis is due to SQLAlchemy attempting to perform a string replacement operation on the numeric value to escape hyphens during query compilation. However, by ensuring that the value is first converted into its native Python equivalent (`np.inp64` to `int`), SQLAlchemy is able to ignore the incorrect target type (in this case `String`), and is able to successfully compile the query:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/138414199-6d12a5c1-08f3-45d2-8654-a98fe4a9b912.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Use a database that doesn't support subqueries, e.g. Druid\r\n2. Create a dataset with a calculated column that returns a numeric value but set it to \"STRING\" type\r\n3. Create a chart with a limit on the series count\r\n3. Notice how the query raises a 500 when fetching data\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nFixes the issue where csv download on explore is not returning the same result as the chart. The results and the full responses are keyed in cache differently. Since we want the csv to match the full results, I'm passing in the result type as full so that it pulls from the correct cache. There are more improvements that we can do later @villebro has a lot of ideas on how we can cache this better, but for now, this is a quick fix for this bug. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5186919/138535561-0f10c887-0408-4049-8d8a-5cda682a825d.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\ncreate a chart with some data, update the data, return to the chart and click to refresh the data. You'll likely see that the results and the chart data are different. Click to download a csv, and it should match the chart data. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce(description):\r\n1. Create VizPlugin that changes only it's ownState with crossFilter functionality e.g. (use only `setDataMask({ ownState: {} })`)\r\n2. Add it to dashboard\r\n3. Try to change `ownState` it reloads all other charts on first time\r\n\r\nIssue: when we check if need reload other charts we auto reload all charts in case if in list of  active filters added new chart(filter), but when we  add only `ownState`, regarding that we added this chart in list of filters it doesn't emit values for other charts, only for itself, so we need to check if it has values emitted outside of this chart\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

enable some iframing of dashboard use cases. Depending on your domain sharding setup, it may not work across origins, so this is a convenient workaround\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI, manual verification\r\n\r\nNote that no unit test was added because this function already is tightly integrated with the document and pulling data from it. This would require quite a large refactor to properly test the existing behavior, much less my newly added behavior\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere was an error report where users were reporting that sql values that they were inputting into the TextAreaControl section would linger even when they closed out and went to a new report, or even created a new report. This was because we were storing the sql in state, but not clearing state when a modal was closed. \r\n\r\nThis state was created to stop cursor errors here: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15820. I believe that @geido made this change. \r\n\r\nThe cursor errors were occurring because we added a debouncer to the ace-editor here: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/10837\r\n\r\nIn investigating this, I was wondering why we had a debouncer for the ace editor to begin with? The input is not using an API, and looking through the different places where TextAreaControl is used, none of them make an API call. So this PR deletes the debouncer, which fixes both the cursor back issue and also gets rid of the state.value //prop.value difference. \r\n\r\nHowever, I wanted to make sure that getting rid of this debouncer is fine @ktmud and @geido ? Where are the places that we should check to make sure?\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/138182082-471e1948-0591-4f86-a4b8-21c264a41ff3.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/138182251-f5d5dfc0-c7dc-4066-a39a-b1b2b1b0cffd.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCreate an alert, exit out.

SUMMARY\r\nThe objective of this PR is to fix an issue with the order of select options when unselecting. It also changes the default sorting algorithm of the `Select` component to alphabetical sorting while providing an alternative to the component's users to override this behavior. Alphabetical sorting is the most common sorting algorithm used by select components in Superset but we do have cases where the order is calculated by different criteria. Another objective of the solution is to enable server-side sorting.\r\n\r\nTo fill these objectives, this PR introduced an optional property to the `Select` called `sortCompator` that accepts a comparison function and is set to alphabetical comparison by default. This function accepts any object that adheres to the select options interface which allows custom properties to be used when comparing the options. This can be used by server-side sorting, where the response can include an `order` field or similar to be used in a custom sort comparator.\r\n\r\nThis comparator is also important to reorder the items after an unselect action because we don't know the original order of the elements, especially with server-side sorting.\r\n\r\nThis PR also:\r\n- Includes test cases for the new property\r\n- Removes previous sorting related code to avoid duplication\r\n- Modifies previous sorting related code to use a custom comparator when necessary\r\n\r\n@geido Can you include this information in the Select API docs?\r\n\r\n@yousoph @rusackas @hughhhh @junlincc \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes the following issues:\r\n\r\n- Undefined owners in the Datasource modal\r\n- Impossible to save with the same owners\r\n\r\nThe problem arose from the fact that the data related to the owners is very inconsistent and comes in three forms:\r\n\r\n- On load the data is of type `[{id: number; first_name: string; last_name: string;}]`\r\n- On selection from the dropdown the data is of type `[{value: number; label: string;}]`\r\n- On save the data is of type `number[]`\r\n\r\nThis PR checks for the different data types to make it work. However, a deeper refactor is required to make the data consistent in both the frontend and the backend\r\n\r\nFollow-up of #17063\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/138094658-0cf94ad6-62d3-4ca8-bd3a-d4f0d8c4136e.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/138094693-5cee5d69-5ea9-4880-85c9-50c8409d75d0.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open Explore\r\n2. Click on \"Edit dataset\"\r\n3. Select an owner and save\r\n4. Re-open the modal and check the owners\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently only legacy charts support identifying filters applied via jinja templates. However, this only supports the `filter_values` function, and is done using regex on the virtual table query. Therefore, filters applied via the `get_filters` function don't work on either v1 or legacy charts, as they aren't caught by the regex. In addition, this approach has the unlikely downside of false positives, if the regex would happen to match a parameter in the regular query, as it didn't check for opening/closing curly braces.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the regex-based identification method with a similar approach to how removed filters are currently identified. The applied filters are added to a list during template rendering, which is made available to the code that is using the template processor. This way the collection of applied filters is automated and happens during template evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe changes proposed here are backwards compatible, and will display filters correctly when the cache is updated (for reviewers remember to force refresh the chart if caching is enabled).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nOn a dashboard with a virtual dataset referencing the `filter_values` jinja function, we can see that the ECharts plugin which uses the v1 chart data endpoint is unable to identify the applied filter value correctly due to the column referenced not being available in the dataset. Notice, however, the NVD3 line chart on the right which identifies the filter correctly due to the regex in `viz.py`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/137710483-8689c36f-767e-40f6-84ed-b84b4b2b1fc0.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow applied filters are identified correctly both on legacy and v1 charts:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/137710388-892d9ccb-5a55-4929-94d0-40861710122a.png)\r\nWhen applying a filter whose column isn't 1) available in the dataset 2) referenced in the jinja code, the filter is also correctly identified as being incompatible:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/137712786-17f0a551-ceff-41b1-bb7e-d05b7237e1f8.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable the `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` feature flag.\r\n2. Create a virtual dataset with the following query: `select *, '{{ filter_values('gender', 'unset')[0] }}' as series from random_time_series`\r\n3. Create a legacy and v1 chart referencing the new virtual dataset\r\n4. Create a dashboard with both charts and add a native filter referencing the \"gender\" column on the \"birth_names\" dataset\r\n5. Apply a filter, e.g. \"boy\"\r\n6. See the indicators work on both the new and old chart\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: closes #15209\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nIf user has invalid template in the query and run the query, SQL Lab will crash.\r\nThe error returned from backend seems not compatible with front-end error handle logic.\r\nFront-end is expecting an `extra` object and has a list of `issue_codes` in extra object. but currently `error` contains single error message.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1135\"

SUMMARY\r\nWhile checking licenses with [license-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-checker) on `superset-frontend`, I noticed we have an LGPL licensed dev dependency `po2json`, which is

SUMMARY\r\nThe goal of this PR is to remove redundant rerenders of key components that build `FilterBar` in order to enhance the performance of native filters.\r\nComponents refactored: `FilterBar`, `FilterControls`, `FilterControl`, `FilterValue`, `CascadePopover`.\r\nThe method was similar to the one used in PRs #16421, #16444, #16525, #16545.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThe number of redundant rerenders of key components the changes (measured by counting logs produced by `whyDidYouRender` library) - tested on `Video Game Sales` dashboard with 5 native filters added:\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n* FilterBar - 182\r\n* FilterControls - 252\r\n* CascadePopover - 960\r\n* FilterControl - 985\r\n* FilterValue - 760\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n* FilterBar - 0\r\n* FilterControls - 0\r\n* CascadePopover - 0\r\n* FilterControl - 0\r\n* FilterValue - 20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoading time on large test dashboard (~80 charts, 15 native filters) - measured as time from opening the dashboard to all charts and native filters fully loaded:\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n~60 seconds\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/137484637-f46d8baf-d5f5-4c48-a652-4a90b66b1a68.mov\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n~45

work the same as before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nWhen executing a chart query with a virtual table that contains a literal value with a colon suffixed by text characters, SQLAlchemy interprets these as being bind parameters when wrapped in a `text` element and compiled. This PR ensures that these are escaped using the same pattern that SQLAlchemy uses to detect bind parameters (the regex is available as a private variable in `TextClause`). Relevant test cases are added (notice that the Postgres cast to `::TIMESTAMP` is not escaped, as SQLAlchemy doesn't consider it to be a bind parameter). To my knowledge there is no cleaner way to do this, and I also found several threads where the author of SQLAlchemy instructed people to solve this issue by mechanically escaping the colon in the statement, which is what this proposal in practice does.\r\n\r\nCloses #17098\r\n\r\nWhen executing the query `SELECT ':00 :abc' as abc, 123 as num` in SQL Lab, the query executes succesfully:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/137272399-9c35408e-ce1f-4f68-83ff-23c8ee222b52.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nWhen used as a virtual table in a chart query, SQLAlchemy interprets there to be two bind parameters present, namely `00` and `abc`, resulting in the following error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/137271820-da952291-681f-49ed-b4a1-adeb8ee35cda.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAfter escaping the bind-like strings, the query renders as expected.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/137271732-0cc27bfb-06ab-42f5-a698-2d468babc8ca.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently dashboard and chart checks for anonymous user by just check `user` variable existance in store, but anonymous user can exists with that object and permissions allowed on public role without authenticating and user id.\r\nSo logic inside reports fails as it tries to encode payload with undefined user id,so check for anonymous user by explicitly checking for valid user id is present.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore, when visiting a public dashboard without authentication\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12967587/137241568-d4f8aa09-f6da-4d5a-a202-a235a2b77dff.png)\r\n\r\nAfter, it loads without report

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nSetup public dashboard and get public url\r\nSetup public user with permissions to that dashboard\r\nLog out and visit the dashboard\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis speaks somewhat to [SIP-15A](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/7656) and the proof-of-concept defined in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7682, but in theory any column in Druid (and not just `__time` which is of type `TIMESTAMP`) could be used as the temporal column and thus should first be converted to a `TIMESTAMP`. \r\n\r\nThis PR replicates the Presto logic which leveraging `CAST(x AS TIMESTAMP)` which works when `x` is a `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP` or `STRING` (these adhere to the ISO 8601 format per the column \"DATETIME FORMAT\"), i.e., \r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid> SELECT CAST(TIMESTAMP '2021-01-01 00:00:00' AS TIMESTAMP)\r\n2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\r\n\r\ndruid> SELECT CAST(DATE '2021-01-01' AS TIMESTAMP)\r\n2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\r\n\r\ndruid> SELECT CAST('2021-01' AS TIMESTAMP)\r\n2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\r\n```\r\n\r\nLong term it would be good to implement something similar to the proof-of-concept to bring clarity to the various transforms and type conversions which are needed for both the left- and right-hand-side of a comparator.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR refactors the color scheme implementation and fixes the following issues:\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/11677\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16970\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16891\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16961\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16980\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/16979\r\n\r\nIt adds the ability to port custom label colors from the Dashboard to Explore.\r\nIt makes the custom label colors persistent and independent from the color scheme change in Dashboard.\r\n\r\n### KNOWN ISSUES\r\n\r\nThere are several known issues related to the color consistency project currently affecting master which will be tackled in separate PRs, as follows:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/17243\r\n- https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/17244\r\n- https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/17318\r\n- Pie chart issue with the categorical color scheme using the same color for the last and first slices of the pie, making it hard to differentiate the two slices (will require deeper investigation)\r\n\r\n### REQUIRED SUPERSET-UI PR\r\n\r\nThis PR requires the change in the related Superset-ui PR to be merged in first https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1406\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\n##### Change a color scheme in Explore. Then refresh.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/137151884-3b0d2713-e279-4c06-9aac-c6a3e3659a1b.mp4\r\n\r\n##### The chart should use the colors in order and restart from the first color in the scheme when running out of available colors.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/137152219-09d92db1-70b6-4470-91b1-1565f9232d54.mp4\r\n\r\n##### Chart should inherit the color scheme of the dashboard\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/137152359-63879a43-788a-488c-a333-c5118957b1ef.mp4\r\n\r\n##### Charts in the dashboard should use custom label color, show the change immediately, on save and on refresh\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/137152699-a4860053-2905-4001-a07a-4bd323c47004.mp4\r\n\r\n##### Explore should use the same color scheme and custom label colors of the originating dashboard\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/137152790-b2ab8a80-869f-4fdc-866b-1e208c0e90d1.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nPlease follow each test case as shown in

SUMMARY\r\nFixes #17060.\r\nDue to a race condition, sometimes `hydrateDashboard` was dispatched after `setActiveTabs`. That caused an override of current active tabs by initial state, which is an empty array. That caused the native filters that are in scope of current tab to be considered as out of scope.\r\nThis PR fixes that behaviour by ensuring that `hydrateDashboard` gets called first. Previously, we called it in `useEffect`, which resulted in calling the function in the NEXT render cycle, after the dashboard components are rendered (`setActiveTabs` is called in mount lifecycle event of the Tabs component). I replaced `useEffect` with an `if` condition based on whether the dashboard has already been hydrated or not (`useRef` was used to ensure that we call it only once). \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked issue\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/137131275-2994e81e-870c-480f-be5f-7bcc5b1b46cd.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a dashboard with native filters\r\n2. Verify that filters are showed as \"in scope\"\r\n3. Go back to dashboard list\r\n4. Go back to the dashboard and verify that native filters still show as they're supposed to\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a regression I introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17050 as it seems like the `P0.25Y` ISO8601 isn't supported, \r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid> SELECT TIME_FLOOR(TIME_PARSE('2020-10-12'), 'P0.25Y')\r\nUnknown exception (java.lang.IllegalArgumentException): Invalid format: \"P0.25Y\"\r\n```\r\nyet per the Druid SQL documentation for `TIME_FLOOR`\r\n\r\n> Rounds down a timestamp, returning it as a new timestamp. Period can be **any** ISO8601 period, like P3M (quarters) or PT12H (half-days).\r\n\r\nit explicitly states **any** ISO8601 format is acceptable. This change uses `P3M` instead (which is the direction o https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17078).\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid> SELECT

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17050 @villebro and myself were discussing why fractional ISO8601 periods were being used to represent either 30 minutes (`PT0.5H`) or the quarter (`P0.25Y`) rather than `PT30M` and `P3M` respectively.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the time grains to reflect the preferred format. Note the `@superset-ui` package needed to be bumped to `0.18.12` as part of the change given the time grains are defined in both repos.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nTested locally. Additionally grepped the coded base by running `git grep \"PT0.5H\" and `git grep \"P0.25Y\"`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

create the generic mechanism and it works well\r\nso you can add to models a the Mixin class who add the \"roles\" functionality \r\n\r\nbut got stack with FAB issues:\r\n1. When FAB tries to initialize an API view that uses a model with that Mixin class, it failed to init the new association_proxy \"roles\". Fab doesn't know to recognize an association_proxy attribute.\r\nto solve it, I encapsulate it under _roles attribute and use hybrid_property\r\n2. When try to request the base APi method \"related\" as \"api/v1/dashboard/related/roles\" \r\nit gets 404 because FAB doesn't recognize the \"roles\" attribute inside FAB SQLAInterface\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def get_related_model(self, col_name: str) -> Type[Model]:\r\n        return self.list_properties[col_name].mapper.class_\r\n```\r\n\r\n@dpgaspar @villebro

SUMMARY\r\nReplaces `src/reduxUtils/areObjectsEqual` occurrences with Lodash `isEqualWith` and adds default customizers. The removed `areObjectsEqual` function was using `omitBy` to remove `undefined` values before passing the object to Lodash `isEqual`. A more efficient way is to pass a customizer to `isEqualWith` ignoring the `undefined` values during the comparison. Apart from the efficiency gain, this PR also aims to provide a utility with default customizers to be used throughout the application and that can be enhanced in the future with more custom functions.\r\n\r\nFollow-up of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16994\r\n\r\n@rusackas @junlincc \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Execute all tests\r\n2 - All tests should

<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/4803\">#4803</a> Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/Methuselah96\"><code>@‚ÄãMethuselah96</code></a>! - Import CSSObject from <code>@‚Äãemotion/react</code> instead of <code>@‚Äãemotion/serialize</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>react-select@5.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Upgrade Guide</h1>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert to TypeScript (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4489\">#4489</a>) - TypeScript types now come packaged with <code>react-select</code> so you no longer need to have <code>@types/react-select</code> installed; we no longer include Flow types</li>\n<li>Drop IE11 support (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4625\">#4625</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4720\">#4720</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4634\">#4634</a>) - this allows us to make changes to our CSS that we've wanted to make for a long time as well as remove unnecessary JS solutions (those changes are noted below)</li>\n<li>Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4489\">#4489</a>) - this means that if you were accessing anything on the <code>Select</code> instance using a <code>ref</code>, the <code>ref</code> will now reference the internal <code>Select</code> directly (see below for how to upgrade)</li>\n<li>Replace HOCs with hooks (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4489\">#4489</a>) - if you were using our HOCs to create custom <code>Select</code>s (i.e., <code>makeCreatableSelect</code>, <code>mangeState</code>, <code>makeAsyncSelect</code>) these have now been replaced by hooks (i.e., <code>useCreatable</code>, <code>useStateManager</code>, <code>useAsync</code>)</li>\n<li>Remove dependency on <a href=\"https://github.com/JedWatson/react-input-autosize\">AutosizeInput</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4625\">#4625</a>) - our new solution uses CSS grid which IE11 does not fully support; also <code>.prefix__input</code> now targets the input and NOT the container</li>\n<li>Improve screen reader experience (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4676\">#4676</a>) - this isn't a breaking change in the API but it does change the screen reader announcements</li>\n<li>Use CSS grid for single value layout (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4720\">#4720</a>) - this also isn't a breaking change in the API but is it a change in the styles since it switches to using CSS grid (not fully supported by IE11) for single-value <code>Select</code>s</li>\n<li>Remove <code>readonly</code> attribute on our <code>DummyInput</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/JedWatson/react-select/issues/4634\">#4634</a>) - this results in better accessibility but uses <code>caret-color</code> which is not available on IE11</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Details</h2>\n<h3>Convert to TypeScript</h3>\n<p>We've rewritten <code>react-select</code> in TypeScript which means you can remove any dependencies on <code>@types/react-select</code>. If you were using the Flow types than look into contributing types for v5 to <code>flow-typed</code>.</p>\n<p>Here are the most notable changes when replacing <code>@types/react-select</code> with our packaged types:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><code>@‚Äãtypes/react-select</code></th>\n<th>react-select</th>\n<th>Notes</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>OptinTypeBase</code></td>\n<td>no replacement</td>\n<td>Options can be any type (if using <code>getOptionValue</code> and <code>getOptionLabel</code>) so there's no longer a base type for options</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>OptionsType</code></td>\n<td><code>Options</code></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GroupTypeBase</code></td>\n<td><code>GroupBase</code></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>GroupedOptionsType</code></td>\n<td>no replacement</td>\n<td>This is equivalent to <code>ReadonlyArray&lt;Group&gt;</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>ValueType</code></td>\n<td><code>OnChangeValue</code></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>InputActionTypes</code></td>\n<td><code>InputAction</code></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>NamedProps</code></td>\n<td><code>Props</code></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>Select</code> (the <code>ref</code> type)</td>\n<td><code>SelectInstance</code></td>\n<td>See &quot;Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components&quot; for more details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>AsyncSelect</code> (the <code>ref</code> type)</td>\n<td><code>SelectInstance</code></td>\n<td>See &quot;Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components&quot; for more details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CreatableSelect</code> (the <code>ref</code> type)</td>\n<td><code>SelectInstance</code></td>\n<td>See &quot;Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components&quot; for more details</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>AsyncCreatableSelect</code> (the <code>ref</code> type)</td>\n<td><code>SelectInstance</code></td>\n<td>See &quot;Use <code>forwardRef</code> for all wrapped components&quot; for more details</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe elasticsearch `CAST` function does not take effect for the `time zone` setting. In ES7.8 and above, we can use the `DATETIME_PARSE` function to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nIn the current master code, the `extra` dict in the database contains the `version` key. We can use version to solve this problem. According to the instructions, version is set for `presto` at the beginning, and ES should also reuse this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Install the latest elasticsearch-dbapi version, 0.2.6, which supports setting the time_zone parameter `pip install elasticsearch-dbapi==0.2.6`\r\n2. Follow the steps in #16726 to create an ES data source, create a data source, set the time_zone parameter and version\r\n<img width=\"530\" alt=\"Êà™Â±è2021-10-09 ‰∏ãÂçà4 47 33\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40813941/136651378-32fe75c1-a703-416d-ae7c-cdf3db122bb4.png\">\r\n\r\n3. Follow the operation steps in #16726 to analyze, and you can see that the DATETIME_PARSE function and time_zone parameter play a correct role\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1903\" alt=\"Êà™Â±è2021-10-09 ‰∏ãÂçà4

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where after adding a dataset the modal would not reset properly. For example, adding if a user added, `database.schema.table`, when they tried to add another dataset the model would be already populated with `database`, `schema` and `table` on the dropdowns.\r\n\r\nWhile troubleshooting the problem I also cleaned up the code. `<TableSelector>` would take as props both a `database` object as well as a database ID. The logic was not correct so they were falling out of sync. I modified the component to take only a database object.\r\n\r\nI also consolidated a database type that was used in slightly different ways ‚Äî the only difference was that one had `allow_multi_schema_metadata_fetch` and the other didn't.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/136627427-e5413f52-ca53-44b5-986b-b54ad83e2b6f.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nAdd a dataset; add another.
