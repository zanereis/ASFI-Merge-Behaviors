Otherwise if user's Spark application also uses global execution context for its Future, the user is facing indeterministic behavior in terms of the thread's context class loader.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen running tpc-ds test (https://github.com/databricks/spark-sql-perf), occasionally we see error related to class not found:\r\n\r\n2020-02-04 20:00:26,673 ERROR yarn.ApplicationMaster: User class threw exception: scala.ScalaReflectionException: class com.databricks.spark.sql.perf.ExperimentRun in JavaMirror with\r\nsun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@28ba21f3 of type class sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader with classpath [...]\r\nand parent being sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader@3ff5d147 of type class sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader with classpath [...]\r\nand parent being primordial classloader with boot classpath [...] not found.\r\n\r\nThis is the root cause for the problem:\r\n\r\nSpark driver starts ApplicationMaster in the main thread, which starts a user thread and set MutableURLClassLoader to that thread's ContextClassLoader.\r\n  userClassThread = startUserApplication()\r\n\r\nThe main thread then setup YarnSchedulerBackend RPC endpoints, which handles these calls using scala Future with the default global ExecutionContext:\r\n  doRequestTotalExecutors\r\n  doKillExecutors\r\n\r\nSo for the main thread and user thread, whoever starts the future first get a chance to set ContextClassLoader to the default thread pool:\r\n\r\n- If main thread starts a future to handle doKillExecutors() before user thread does then the default thread pool thread's ContextClassLoader would be the default (AppClassLoader).\r\n- If user thread starts a future first then the thread pool thread will have MutableURLClassLoader.\r\n\r\nNote that only MutableURLClassLoader can load user provided class for the Spark app, you will see errors related to class not found if the ContextClassLoader is AppClassLoader.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests and manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBased on the discussion in the mailing list [[Proposal] Modification to Spark's Semantic Versioning Policy](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Proposal-Modification-to-Spark-s-Semantic-Versioning-Policy-td28938.html) , this PR is to add back the following APIs whose maintenance cost are relatively small.\r\n\r\n- SQLContext.applySchema\r\n- SQLContext.parquetFile\r\n- SQLContext.jsonFile\r\n- SQLContext.jsonRDD\r\n- SQLContext.load\r\n- SQLContext.jdbc\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid breaking the APIs that are commonly used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nAdding back the APIs that were removed in 3.0 branch does not introduce the user-facing changes, because Spark 3.0 has not been released. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-06T19:31:55Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T06:49:51Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T06:49:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"248df1bb56ef12b79d7d64e56958aad6107dcb95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/de7811d7644e44d110a3ef3e25edbc51d146fdda","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:addAPIBackV3","ref":"addAPIBackV3","sha":"de7811d7644e44d110a3ef3e25edbc51d146fdda","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow up for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27650 where allow None provider for create table. Here we are doing the same thing for ReplaceTable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAlthough currently the ASTBuilder doesn't seem to allow `replace` without `USING` clause. This would allow `DataFrameWriterV2` to use the statements instead of commands directly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI've applied following changed to StagePage.\r\n1. Added `Shuffle Write Time` to task metrics summary.\r\n2. Added checkbox for `Shuffle Write Time` as an additional metrics.\r\n3. Renamed `Write Time` column in task table to `Shuffle Write Time` and let it as an additional column.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTask metrics summary doesn't show `Shuffle Write Time` even though it shows `Shuffle Read Blocked Time`.\r\n`Shuffle Read Blocked Time` is let as an additional metrics so I also let `Shuffle Write Time` as an other additional metrics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. After this change, task metrics summary can show `Shuffle Write Time` and its visibility is controlled by a checkbox.\r\n![additional-metrics-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/76101844-677acb80-6012-11ea-9923-d95d852c775b.png)\r\n![task-summary-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/76101856-6ea1d980-6012-11ea-9670-3cf0ecd6faff.png)\r\n\r\n`Write Time` column is already shown in task table but the title is ambiguous so I've renamed it as `Shuffle Write Time`.\r\nAfter this change, this column is also additional column like `Shuffle Read Blocked Time`.\r\n![tasks-table-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/76102216-00a9e200-6013-11ea-9d51-1a6ce2abb0b9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI've tested manually using following code and confirm the UI.\r\n`sc.parallelize(1 to 1000).map(x =>

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26051 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26066\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere is no standard requiring that `size(null)` must return null, and returning -1 looks reasonable as well. This is kind of a cosmetic change and we should avoid it if it breaks existing queries. This is similar to reverting TRIM function parameter order change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, change the behavior of `size(null)` back to be the same as 2.4.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch changes to log better message (at least relevant to decommission) when registering signal handler for SIGPWR fails. SIGPWR is non-POSIX and not all unix-like OS support it; we can easily find the case, macOS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark already logs message on failing to register handler for SIGPWR, but the error message is too general which doesn't give the information of the impact. End users should be noticed that failing to register handler for SIGPWR effectively \"disables\" the feature of decommission.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via running standalone master/worker in macOS 10.14.6, with `spark.worker.decommission.enabled= true`, and submit an example application to run executors.\r\n\r\n(NOTE: the message may be different a bit, as the message can be updated in review phase.)\r\n\r\nFor worker log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n20/03/06 17:19:13 INFO

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn Spark version 2.4 and earlier, datetime parsing, formatting and conversion are performed by using the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian). \r\nSince the Proleptic Gregorian calendar is de-facto calendar worldwide, as well as the chosen one in ANSI SQL standard, Spark 3.0 switches to it by using Java 8 API classes (the java.time packages that are based on ISO chronology ). The switching job is completed in SPARK-26651. \r\nBut after the switching, there are some patterns not compatible between Java 8 and Java 7, Spark needs its own definition on the patterns rather than depends on Java API.\r\nIn this PR, we achieve this by writing the document and shadow the incompatible letters. See more details in [SPARK-31030](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31030)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\nAfter we define our own datetime parsing and formatting patterns, it's same to old Spark version.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting and new added UT.\r\nLocally document test:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4833765/76064100-f6acc280-5fc3-11ea-9ef7-82e7dc074205.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-06T08:08:15Z","updated_at":"2020-03-12T17:09:03Z","closed_at":"2020-03-11T06:11:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd5dddd1e2376e959c56510d3712aea7c1a9607b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27830/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27830/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27830/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/53825089b0e553fe912bd7bd16fc453cc94c36c8","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-31030","ref":"SPARK-31030","sha":"53825089b0e553fe912bd7bd16fc453cc94c36c8","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

/ 1.5(357913941)) instead of 512 million.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test.","created_at":"2020-03-06T07:54:02Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T23:38:49Z","closed_at":"2020-03-16T01:20:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"313d20b0b5be119cd56d8a49bc4c98d2c12078f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27828/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27828/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27828/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90d1eeab4d052c2fc2c16e66d5918fc9dc1306d2","head":{"label":"LantaoJin:SPARK-31068","ref":"SPARK-31068","sha":"90d1eeab4d052c2fc2c16e66d5918fc9dc1306d2","user":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90969496,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDk2OTQ5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"LantaoJin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs a common usage and according to the spark doc, users may often just copy their `hive-site.xml` to Spark directly from hive projects. Sometimes, the config file is not that clean for spark and may cause some side effects.\r\n\r\nfor example, `hive.session.history.enabled` will create a log for the hive jobs but useless for spark and also it will not be deleted on JVM exit.\r\n\r\nthis pr\r\n 1) disable `hive.session.history.enabled` explicitly to disable creating `hive_job_log` file, e.g.\r\n```\r\nHive history file=/var/folders/01/h81cs4sn3dq2dd_k4j6fhrmc0000gn/T//kentyao/hive_job_log_79c63b29-95a4-4935-a9eb-2d89844dfe4f_493861201.txt\r\n```\r\n2) set `hive.execution.engine` to `spark` explicitly in case the config is `tez` and casue uneccesary problem like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/tez/dag/api/SessionNotRunning\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.session.SessionState.start(SessionState.java:529)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nreduce overhead of internal complexity and users' hive cognitive load for  running spark\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, `hive_job_log` file will not be created even enabled, and will not try to initialize tez kinds of stuff\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses missed spot on SPARK-30964 (#27716) - SPARK-30964 added secondary index which defines the relationship between parent - children and able to operate all children for given parent faster.\r\n\r\nWhile SPARK-30964 handled the addition and deletion of secondary index in InstanceList properly, it missed to add code to handle deletion of secondary index in CountingRemoveIfForEach, resulting to the leak of indices. This patch adds the deletion of secondary index in CountingRemoveIfForEach.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDescribed above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A, as relevant field and class are marked as private, and it cannot be checked in higher level. I'm not sure we want to adjust scope to add a test.","created_at":"2020-03-06T04:40:57Z","updated_at":"2020-03-08T00:15:23Z","closed_at":"2020-03-07T20:03:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b14769f96ba154a99551b67c6a13bd897fe7cab7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nParquet's org.apache.parquet.filter2.predicate.FilterApi uses `dots` as separators to split the column name into multi-parts of nested fields. The drawback is this causes issues when the field name contains `dots`.\r\n\r\nThe new APIs that will be added will take array of string directly for multi-parts of nested fields, so no confusion as using `dots` as separators.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support nested predicate pushdown and predicate pushdown for columns containing `dots`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBased on the discussion in the mailing list [[Proposal] Modification to Spark's Semantic Versioning Policy](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Proposal-Modification-to-Spark-s-Semantic-Versioning-Policy-td28938.html) , this PR is to add back the following APIs whose maintenance cost are relatively small.\r\n\r\n- functions.toDegrees/toRadians \r\n- functions.approxCountDistinct \r\n- functions.monotonicallyIncreasingId\r\n- Column.!==\r\n- Dataset.explode\r\n- Dataset.registerTempTable\r\n- SQLContext.getOrCreate, setActive, clearActive, constructors\r\n\r\nBelow is the other removed APIs in the original PR, but not added back in this PR [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25908]:\r\n\r\n- Remove some AccumulableInfo .apply() methods\r\n- Remove non-label-specific multiclass precision/recall/fScore in favor of accuracy\r\n- Remove unused Python StorageLevel constants\r\n- Remove unused multiclass option in libsvm parsing\r\n- Remove references to deprecated spark configs like spark.yarn.am.port\r\n- Remove TaskContext.isRunningLocally\r\n- Remove ShuffleMetrics.shuffle* methods\r\n- Remove BaseReadWrite.context in favor of session\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid breaking the APIs that are commonly used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nAdding back the APIs that were removed in 3.0 branch does not introduce the user-facing changes, because Spark 3.0 has not been released. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new test suite for these

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBased on the discussion in the mailing list [[Proposal] Modification to Spark's Semantic Versioning Policy](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Proposal-Modification-to-Spark-s-Semantic-Versioning-Policy-td28938.html) , this PR is to add back the following APIs whose maintenance cost are relatively small.\r\n\r\n- toDegrees/toRadians \r\n- approxCountDistinct \r\n- Column.!==\r\n- Dataset.explode\r\n- Dataset.registerTempTable\r\n- SQLContext.getOrCreate, setActive, clearActive, constructors\r\n- monotonicallyIncreasingId\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid breaking the APIs that are commonly used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nAdding back the APIs that were removed in 3.0 branch does not introduce the user-facing changes, because Spark 3.0 has not been released. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTODO: add a new test suite for these APIs.","created_at":"2020-03-06T00:35:37Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T00:36:02Z","closed_at":"2020-03-06T00:36:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb9168994f1db0b64f3c82ddf640760867ab8bb6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0cda5ae0647a41fb36151e5f48dc42e59793478e","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:addAPIBackV2","ref":"addAPIBackV2","sha":"0cda5ae0647a41fb36151e5f48dc42e59793478e","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn data source `Filter`, currently, if a column name contains `dots`, it is not quoted. This causes couple issues.\r\n\r\n1. Hard to extend the `Filter` to support nested column predicate pushdown as many data sources such as Parquet and ORC are using `dots` as separators for nested columns. This can be addressed if we quote the name containing `dots` properly in this PR.\r\n\r\n2. Because of the above issues,  we are handling the quoting in data source implementations before we convert the predicates into specific implementation for a particular data source. We should handle them in data source filter to make it consistently.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo handle column names containing `dots` more consistently. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs and new UTs.","created_at":"2020-03-05T23:45:17Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T00:43:17Z","closed_at":"2020-03-10T17:32:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97b2970c504fc2c07fbd461c18664223dd4a8946","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27817/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27817/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27817/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c5fc25f6ee70eb8a9e291020b51fecae580b8e8c","head":{"label":"dbtsai:SPARK-31060","ref":"SPARK-31060","sha":"c5fc25f6ee70eb8a9e291020b51fecae580b8e8c","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34716514,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDcxNjUxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dbtsai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai/spark","description":"Mirror

Policy](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/Proposal-Modification-to-Spark-s-Semantic-Versioning-Policy-td28938.html) , this PR is to add back the following APIs whose maintenance cost are relatively small.\r\n\r\n- HiveContext\r\n- createExternalTable APIs\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAvoid breaking the APIs that are commonly used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nAdding back the APIs that were removed in 3.0 branch does not introduce the user-facing changes, because Spark 3.0 has not been released. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadd a new test suite for createExternalTable

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR, I propose to turn on `-deprecation` in SparkShell by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWithout `-deprecation`, user can not know details(why we deprecate, any alternatives to use) of the deprecation API and they even don't know the warning is from which deprecated API.\r\n\r\nThough, Scala REPL will tell user to use `:setting -deprecation` or `:replay -deprecation` to enable deprecation. But we can not guarantee that user know exactly how to use it and they may even not willing to do it. So, I think show the details of deprecation explicitly by ourself will give user a chance to learn Spark's deprecated API.\r\n\r\nBesides, there's always a warning. So, why don't we choose the detail and useful one?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. When using a deprecate API,\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\nscala> Row.merge(Row(1,2,3), Row(4,5,6))\r\nwarning: there was one deprecation warning (since 3.0.0); for details, enable `:setting -deprecation' or `:replay -deprecation'\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.Row = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\nscala> Row.merge(Row(1,2,3), Row(4,5,6))\r\n<console>:28: warning: method merge in object Row is deprecated (since 3.0.0): This method is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.\r\n       Row.merge(Row(1,2,3), Row(4,5,6))\r\n           ^\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.Row = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested manually.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-05T16:22:13Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T07:16:54Z","closed_at":"2020-03-06T07:16:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3036a4336720e57dafa691e2df43047ce0920562","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27813/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27813/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27813/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/36509555cb20323d1c5517b07f44f91422267518","head":{"label":"Ngone51:repl_reprecation","ref":"repl_reprecation","sha":"36509555cb20323d1c5517b07f44f91422267518","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR propose\r\n\r\n1. Explicitly include xml-apis. xml-apis is already the part of xerces 2.12.0 (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/xerces/xercesImpl/2.12.0/xercesImpl-2.12.0.pom). However, we're excluding it by setting `scope` to `test`. This seems causing `spark-shell`, built from Maven, to fail.\r\n\r\n    Seems like previously xml-apis wasn't reached for some reasons but after we upgrade, it seems requiring. Therefore, this PR proposes to include it.\r\n\r\n2. Pins `xerces` version in SBT as well. Seems this dependency is resolved differently from Maven.\r\n\r\nNote that Hadoop 3 does not looks requiring this as they replaced xerces as of [HDFS-12221](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-12221).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make `spark-shell` working from Maven build, and uses the same xerces version.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's master only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n**1.**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./build/mvn -DskipTests -Psparkr

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change conversion of java.sql.Timestamp/Date values to/from internal values of Catalyst's TimestampType/DateType before cutover day `1582-10-15` of Gregorian calendar. I propose to construct local date-time from microseconds/days since the epoch. Take each date-time component `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, `second` and `second fraction`, and construct java.sql.Timestamp/Date using the extracted components.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis will rebase underlying time/date offset in the way that collected java.sql.Timestamp/Date values will have the same local time-date component as the original values in Gregorian calendar.\r\n\r\nHere is the example which demonstrates the issue:\r\n```sql\r\nscala> sql(\"select date '1100-10-10'\").collect()\r\nres1: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([1100-10-03])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the changes:\r\n```sql\r\nscala> sql(\"select date '1100-10-10'\").collect()\r\nres0: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([1100-10-10])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis defines the devision of two `CalendarInterval`s as the ratio between the time duration of both. The `CalendarInterval` consists of three time components: `months`, `days` and `microseconds`. The division is only defined between intervals that have a single non-zero time component, while both intervals have the same non-zero time component. Otherwise the division expression would be ambiguous.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPutting interval into relation is a natural expression: 1 day / 1 hour = number of hours per day.\r\n\r\nThis allows to evaluate the magnitude of `CalendarInterval`s in SQL expressions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSeq((Timestamp.valueOf(\"2020-02-01 12:00:00\"), Timestamp.valueOf(\"2020-02-01 13:30:25\")))\r\n  .toDF(\"start\", \"end\")\r\n  .withColumn(\"interval\", $\"end\" - $\"start\")\r\n  .withColumn(\"interval [h]\", $\"interval\" / lit(\"1 hour\").cast(CalendarIntervalType))\r\n  .withColumn(\"rate [€/h]\", lit(1.45))\r\n  .withColumn(\"price [€]\", $\"interval [h]\" * $\"rate [€/h]\")\r\n  .show(false)\r\n+-------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------+------------------+----------+------------------+\r\n|start              |end                |interval                     |interval [h]      |rate [€/h]|price [€]         |\r\n+-------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------+------------------+----------+------------------+\r\n|2020-02-01 12:00:00|2020-02-01 13:30:25|1 hours 30 minutes 25 seconds|1.5069444444444444|1.45      |2.1850694444444443|\r\n+-------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------+------------------+----------+------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe currently available approach is\r\n\r\n```\r\nSeq((Timestamp.valueOf(\"2020-02-01 12:00:00\"), Timestamp.valueOf(\"2020-02-01 13:30:25\")))\r\n  .toDF(\"start\", \"end\")\r\n  .withColumn(\"interval [s]\", unix_timestamp($\"end\") - unix_timestamp($\"start\"))\r\n  .withColumn(\"interval [h]\", $\"interval [s]\" / 3600)\r\n  .withColumn(\"rate [€/h]\", lit(1.45))\r\n  .withColumn(\"price [€]\", $\"interval [h]\" * $\"rate [€/h]\")\r\n  .show(false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nGoing through `unix_timestamp` is a hack and it pollutes the SQL query with unrelated semantics (unix timestamp is completely irrelevant for this computation). It is merely there because there is currently no way to access the length of an `CalendarInterval`. Dividing an interval by another interval provides means to measure the length in an arbitrary unit (minutes, hours, quarter hours).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nIt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose:\r\n\r\n1. To replace matching by `Literal` in `ExprUtils.evalSchemaExpr()` to checking foldable property of the `schema` expression.\r\n2. To replace matching by `Literal` in `ExprUtils.evalTypeExpr()` to checking foldable property of the `schema` expression.\r\n3. To change checking of the input parameter in the `SchemaOfCsv` expression, and allow foldable `child` expression.\r\n4. To change checking of the input parameter in the `SchemaOfJson` expression, and allow foldable `child` expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis should improve Spark SQL UX for `from_csv`/`from_json`. Currently, Spark expects only literals:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select from_csv('1,Moscow', replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', ''));\r\nError in query: Schema should be specified in DDL format as a string literal or output of the schema_of_csv function instead of replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', '');; line 1 pos 7\r\nspark-sql> select from_json('{\"id\":1, \"city\":\"Moscow\"}', replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', ''));\r\nError in query: Schema should be specified in DDL format as a string literal or output of the schema_of_json function instead of replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', '');; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\nand only string literals are acceptable as CSV examples by `schema_of_csv`/`schema_of_json`:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select schema_of_csv(concat_ws(',', 0.1, 1));\r\nError in query: cannot resolve 'schema_of_csv(concat_ws(',', CAST(0.1BD AS STRING), CAST(1 AS STRING)))' due to data type mismatch: The input csv should be a string literal and not null; however, got concat_ws(',', CAST(0.1BD AS STRING), CAST(1 AS STRING)).; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias(schema_of_csv(concat_ws(,, cast(0.1 as string), cast(1 as string))), None)]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\nspark-sql> select schema_of_json(regexp_replace('{\"item_id\": 1, \"item_price\": 0.1}', 'item_', ''));\r\nError in query: cannot resolve 'schema_of_json(regexp_replace('{\"item_id\": 1, \"item_price\": 0.1}', 'item_', ''))' due to data type mismatch: The input json should be a string literal and not null; however, got regexp_replace('{\"item_id\": 1, \"item_price\": 0.1}', 'item_', '').; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias(schema_of_json(regexp_replace({\"item_id\": 1, \"item_price\": 0.1}, item_, )), None)]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the changes users can pass any foldable string expression as the `schema` parameter to `from_csv()/from_json()`. For the example above:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select from_csv('1,Moscow', replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', ''));\r\n{\"id\":1,\"city\":\"Moscow\"}\r\nspark-sql> select from_json('{\"id\":1, \"city\":\"Moscow\"}', replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', ''));\r\n{\"id\":1,\"city\":\"Moscow\"}\r\n```\r\nAfter change the `schema_of_csv`/`schema_of_json` functions accept foldable expressions, for example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select schema_of_csv(concat_ws(',', 0.1, 1));\r\nstruct<_c0:double,_c1:int>\r\nspark-sql> select schema_of_json(regexp_replace('{\"item_id\": 1, \"item_price\": 0.1}', 'item_', ''));\r\nstruct<id:bigint,price:double>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test to `CsvFunctionsSuite` and to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the master, we currently don't support any nested generators, but I think supporting limited nested cases is somewhat useful for users, e.g., explode(explode(v)). This PR intends to add some logics in `ExtractGenerator` for supporting the nested generators as follows;\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// before this PR\r\nscala> sql(\"select explode(explode(array(array(1, 2), array(3))))\").show()\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Generators are not supported when it's nested in expressions, but got: explode(explode(array(array(1, 2), array(3))));\r\n\r\n// after this PR\r\nscala> sql(\"select explode(explode(array(array(1, 2), array(3))))\").show()\r\n+---+\r\n|col|\r\n+---+\r\n|  1|\r\n|  2|\r\n|  3|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI saw some usecases on the web where users expand nested arrays by a `unnest` function in potgresql and google big query;\r\n```\r\npostgres=# select unnest(ARRAY[ARRAY[1,2],ARRAY[3,4]]);\r\n unnest \r\n--------\r\n      1\r\n      2\r\n      3\r\n      4\r\n(4 rows)\r\n```\r\nBased on this, IMO extending the existing `explode` for nested arrays seems helpful for users.\r\nFYI: we already have the [jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28382) for implementing the unnest function, but we've closed the jira because of our policy as you know.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse `listLocatedStatus` when `lnMemoryFileIndex` is listing files from a `ViewFileSystem` which should delegate to that of `DistributedFileSystem`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen `ViewFileSystem` is used to manage several `DistributedFileSystem`, the change will improve performance of file listing, especially when there are many files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `dev/make-distribution.sh` a bit easier to use by not hiding errors thrown by Maven.\r\n\r\nAs a supporting change, this PR also suppresses progress bar output from curl and wget that may be output from within `build/mvn`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's surprising for command-line options to be position-dependent. The errors that get thrown when you pass the correct option (like `--pip`) but in the wrong order are confusing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI ran a few invocations of `make-distribution.sh` to confirm that, when passed incorrect options, I can actually see the errors thrown directly by Maven.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-05T02:07:14Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T15:30:49Z","closed_at":"2020-03-11T13:22:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03f5a3ead9ba0042ce860d8dd52ab0630fe7583a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dcc0df7a2ed6464c01809fbff86393df7ac5b67f","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-31041-make-distribution","ref":"SPARK-31041-make-distribution","sha":"dcc0df7a2ed6464c01809fbff86393df7ac5b67f","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change checking of the input parameter in the `SchemaOfJson` expression, and allow foldable `child` expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. Currently, only string literals are acceptable as JSON examples by `schema_of_json`:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select schema_of_json(regexp_replace('{\"item_id\": 1, \"item_price\": 0.1}', 'item_', ''));\r\nError in query: cannot resolve 'schema_of_json(regexp_replace('{\"item_id\": 1, \"item_price\": 0.1}', 'item_', ''))' due to data type mismatch: The input json should be a string literal and not null; however, got regexp_replace('{\"item_id\": 1, \"item_price\": 0.1}', 'item_', '').; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias(schema_of_json(regexp_replace({\"item_id\": 1, \"item_price\": 0.1}, item_, )), None)]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after change the `schema_of_json` accepts foldable expressions, for example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select schema_of_json(regexp_replace('{\"item_id\": 1, \"item_price\": 0.1}', 'item_', ''));\r\nstruct<id:bigint,price:double>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing test suites `JsonFunctionsSuite` and `JsonExpressionsSuite`.\r\n- Added new test to `JsonFunctionsSuite` to check foldable input.","created_at":"2020-03-04T20:31:56Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:22Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T12:32:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e14b1641eb0eddf9ed597ca88d3d68e2a5a16e56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1f598a7b32ae88e6ba8153674195e55d275a681d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:foldable-schema_of_json","ref":"foldable-schema_of_json","sha":"1f598a7b32ae88e6ba8153674195e55d275a681d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe method `removeAllByIndexValues` in KVStore is to delete all the objects which have certain values in the given index.\r\nHowever, in the current implementation of `InMemoryStore`, when the given index is the natural key index, there is no special handling for it and a linear search over all the task data is performed.\r\n\r\nWe can improve it by deleting the natural keys directly from the internal hashmap.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBetter performance if the given index for `removeAllByIndexValues` is the natural key index in\r\n`InMemoryStore`\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nEnhance the existing test.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-04T18:19:36Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T22:54:09Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T22:54:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"273cb2a61f2fd2794218b2869d68b81b442041e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27796/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27796/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27796/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7576e62837fc97283a7cb1ce06b3835eb63fdad4","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:cherry-pick-27763","ref":"cherry-pick-27763","sha":"7576e62837fc97283a7cb1ce06b3835eb63fdad4","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse scala annotation @deprecate to deprecate untyped scala UDF.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen introducing AQE to others, I feel the config names are a bit incoherent and hard to use.\r\nThis PR refines the config names:\r\n1. remove the \"shuffle\" prefix. AQE is all about shuffle and we don't need to add the \"shuffle\" prefix everywhere.\r\n2. `targetPostShuffleInputSize` is obscure, rename to `advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes`.\r\n3. `reducePostShufflePartitions` doesn't match the actual optimization, rename to `coalescePartitions`\r\n4. `minNumPostShufflePartitions` is obscure, rename it `minPartitionNum` under the `coalescePartitions` namespace\r\n5. `maxNumPostShufflePartitions` is confusing with the word \"max\", rename it `initialPartitionNum`\r\n6. `skewedJoinOptimization` is too verbose. skew join is a well-known terminology in database area, we can just say `skewJoin` \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake the config names easy to understand.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\ndeprecate the config `spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.targetPostShuffleInputSize`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe `spark.sql.session.timeZone` config can accept any string value including invalid time zone ids, then it will fail other queries that rely on the time zone. We should do the value checking in the set phase and fail fast if the zone value is invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, compute summary and update distributions in one pass;\r\n2, remove logic related to check `shouldDistributeGaussians`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn current impl, GMM need to trigger two jobs at one iteration:\r\n1, one to compute summary;\r\n2, if `shouldDistributeGaussians = ((k - 1.0) / k) * numFeatures > 25.0`, trigger another to update distributions;\r\n\r\n`shouldDistributeGaussians` is almost true in practice, since numFeatures is likely to be greater than 25.\r\n\r\nWe can use only one job to impl above computation, by following the logic in `KMeans`: using `reduceByKey` to compute statistics for each center\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen starting Spark driver and executors on Yarn cluster, the JVM process can discover all CPU cores on the system and set thread-pool or GC threads based on that value. We should limit what the JVM sees for the number of cores set by the user (spark.driver.cores or spark.executor.cores) by \"-XX:ActiveProcessorCount\", which was introduced in Java 8u191.\r\n\r\nEspecially in running Spark on Yarn inside Kubernetes container, the number of CPU cores discovered sometimes is 1, which means it always use 1 thread in the default thread pool, or GC threads.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout the change, when running Spark on Yarn, the number of available processors discovered by JVM is not correct. User has assigned driver and executors the number of cores to use and we should honor that. A simple test would be using this Java code:\r\n    Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt is a simple change to the JVM start command, verified manually.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-04T01:46:54Z","updated_at":"2020-03-07T20:34:17Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T18:50:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a21f5fd678fcc753803db66f9abb315f69971b97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nParquet predicate pushdown on columns with dots is disabled in [SPARK-20364](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20364) due to the limitation of Parquet APIs.\r\n\r\nA new set of APIs is purposed in [PARQUET-1809](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-1809) to generalize the support for both cols containing `dot` and nested cols.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a new Parquet filter APIs that supports both column names containing `dot` and nested columns. We will remove those code from Spark codebase once we upgrade to a new release of Parquet that contains this implementation. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMany tables in production are using `dot` as part of the column names, and without predicate pushdown on those columns, the performance is suffering.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests and one new test.","created_at":"2020-03-03T23:56:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-10T22:09:07Z","closed_at":"2020-03-10T17:42:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aeb9369233ea7d687affa278f5323eceace3c734","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27780/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27780/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27780/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1e00859ad1741358aa1a609745de1b31bca26dc5","head":{"label":"dbtsai:SPARK-31026","ref":"SPARK-31026","sha":"1e00859ad1741358aa1a609745de1b31bca26dc5","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34716514,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDcxNjUxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dbtsai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.github

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change checking of the input parameter in the `SchemaOfCsv` expression, and allow foldable `child` expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. Currently, only string literals are acceptable as CSV examples by `schema_of_csv`:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select schema_of_csv(concat_ws(',', 0.1, 1));\r\nError in query: cannot resolve 'schema_of_csv(concat_ws(',', CAST(0.1BD AS STRING), CAST(1 AS STRING)))' due to data type mismatch: The input csv should be a string literal and not null; however, got concat_ws(',', CAST(0.1BD AS STRING), CAST(1 AS STRING)).; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias(schema_of_csv(concat_ws(,, cast(0.1 as string), cast(1 as string))), None)]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after change the `schema_of_csv` accepts foldable expressions, for example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select schema_of_csv(concat_ws(',', 0.1, 1));\r\nstruct<_c0:double,_c1:int>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing test suites `CsvFunctionsSuite` and `CsvExpressionsSuite`.\r\n- Added new test to `CsvFunctionsSuite` to check foldable input.","created_at":"2020-03-03T19:55:21Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:17Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T12:33:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11ab2e110e47beb81eb4014adb58e214fd3e45e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27777/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27777/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27777/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/222a31c58da47406a8aaa33830be3abd87779594","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:foldable-schema_of_csv","ref":"foldable-schema_of_csv","sha":"222a31c58da47406a8aaa33830be3abd87779594","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace matching by `Literal` in `ExprUtils.evalTypeExpr()` to checking foldable property of the `schema` expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis should improve Spark SQL UX for `from_json`. Currently, Spark expects a string literal or `schema_of_json` w/ a string literal:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select from_json('{\"id\":1, \"city\":\"Moscow\"}', replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', ''));\r\nError in query: Schema should be specified in DDL format as a string literal or output of the schema_of_json function instead of replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', '');; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the changes users can pass any foldable string expression as the `schema` parameter to `from_json()`. For the example above:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select from_json('{\"id\":1, \"city\":\"Moscow\"}', replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', ''));\r\n{\"id\":1,\"city\":\"Moscow\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test to `JsonFunctionsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-03T16:31:27Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:15Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T12:33:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4e6d7a4a361fff7a7be956dab1ab9e94d8aa06b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27774/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27774/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27774/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f49069790e6fa9231ad961069e67bb41f67de25","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:foldable-evalTypeExpr","ref":"foldable-evalTypeExpr","sha":"5f49069790e6fa9231ad961069e67bb41f67de25","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is the core scheduler changes to support Stage level scheduling. \r\n\r\nThe main changes here include modification to the DAGScheduler to look at the ResourceProfiles associated with an RDD and have those applied inside the scheduler.\r\nCurrently if multiple RDD's in a stage have conflicting ResourceProfiles we throw an error. logic to allow this will happen in SPARK-29153. I added the interfaces to RDD to add and get the REsourceProfile so that I could add unit tests for the scheduler. These are marked as private for now until we finish the feature and will be exposed in SPARK-29150. If you think this is confusing I can remove those and remove the tests and add them back later.\r\nI modified the task scheduler to make sure to only schedule on executor that exactly match the resource profile. It will then check those executors to make sure the current resources meet the task needs before assigning it.  In here I changed the way we do the custom resource assignment. \r\nOther changes here include having the cpus per task passed around so that we can properly account for them. Previously we just used the one global config, but now it can change based on the ResourceProfile.\r\nI removed the exceptions that require the cores to be the limiting resource. With this change all the places I found that used executor cores /task cpus as slots has been updated to use the ResourceProfile logic and look to see what resource is limiting.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nStage level sheduling feature\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nunit tests and lots of manual

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nrename the config and make it non-internal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nNow we fail the query if duplicated map keys are detected, and provide a legacy config to deduplicate it. However, we must provide a way to get users out of this situation, instead of just rejecting to run the query. This exit strategy should always be there, while legacy config indicates that it may be removed someday.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, just rename a config which was added in 3.0\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd more tests for the fail behavior.","created_at":"2020-03-03T14:00:33Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T11:49:05Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T11:44:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b1e0a967d815c30b54863f079fbf070db3176a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27772/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27772/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27772/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b201c9e68d7f8c5d3e4145b10f0820c247ca4ad8","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:map","ref":"map","sha":"b201c9e68d7f8c5d3e4145b10f0820c247ca4ad8","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace matching by `Literal` in `ExprUtils.evalSchemaExpr()` to checking foldable property of the `schema` expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis should improve Spark SQL UX for `from_csv`. Currently, Spark expects only literals:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select from_csv('1,Moscow', replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', ''));\r\nError in query: Schema should be specified in DDL format as a string literal or output of the schema_of_csv function instead of replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', '');; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the changes users can pass any foldable string expression as the `schema` parameter to `from_csv()`. For the example above:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select from_csv('1,Moscow', replace('dpt_org_id INT, dpt_org_city STRING', 'dpt_org_', ''));\r\n{\"id\":1,\"city\":\"Moscow\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test to `CsvFunctionsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-03T13:49:16Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:16Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T12:33:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"98df86c0aaa11ba67086a47686b0ea28e6dc2af9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e95e8a753c63eb868af6a1945b5059f064dc8cd7","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:foldable-evalSchemaExpr","ref":"foldable-evalSchemaExpr","sha":"e95e8a753c63eb868af6a1945b5059f064dc8cd7","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded 2 tests for `ShuffleBlockFetcherIteratorSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen packaging shuffle fetch requests in `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator`, there are two limitations: `maxBytesInFlight` and `maxBlocksInFlightPerAddress`. However, we don’t have test cases to test them both, e.g. the size limitation is hit before the numBlocks limitation.\r\n\r\nWe should add test cases in `ShuffleBlockFetcherIteratorSuite` to test:\r\n\r\n1. the size limitation is hit before the numBlocks limitation\r\n2. the numBlocks limitation is hit before the size limitation\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-03T07:38:22Z","updated_at":"2020-03-04T13:30:32Z","closed_at":"2020-03-04T12:22:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94951d50847bba62a49344f5a6b0732d52d830f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27767/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27767/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27767/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1c7d55990e10802b0858515d06fbcaefb92dd7e0","head":{"label":"Ngone51:add_test","ref":"add_test","sha":"1c7d55990e10802b0858515d06fbcaefb92dd7e0","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses missed spot on SPARK-30964 (#27716) - SPARK-30964 added secondary index which defines the relationship between parent - children and able to operate all children for given parent faster.\r\n\r\nWhile SPARK-30964 handled the addition and deletion of secondary index in InstanceList properly, it missed to add code to handle deletion of secondary index in CountingRemoveIfForEach, resulting to the leak of indices. This patch adds the deletion of secondary index in CountingRemoveIfForEach.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDescribed above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A, as relevant field and class are marked as private, and it cannot be checked in higher level. I'm not sure we want to adjust scope to add a test.","created_at":"2020-03-03T03:48:45Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T04:42:03Z","closed_at":"2020-03-04T18:05:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df0c3149c962ae814f14d259b816e432ea459452","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27765/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27765/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27765/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2b618cf1a96e03e681a899755dfe708108316493","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-31014","ref":"SPARK-31014","sha":"2b618cf1a96e03e681a899755dfe708108316493","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

The rolling event log directory is created ignoring the dfs umask setting. This allows the history server to prune old rolling logs when run as the group owner of the event log folder.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor non-rolling event logs, log files are created ignoring the umask setting by calling setPermission after creating the file. The default umask of 022 currently causes rolling log directories to be created without group write permissions, preventing the history server from pruning logs of applications not run as the same user as the history server. This adds the same behavior for rolling event logs so users don't need to worry about the umask setting causing different behavior.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually. The folder is created with the correct 770 permission. The status file is still affected by the umask setting, but that doesn't stop the folder from being deleted by the history server. I'm not sure if that causes any other issues. I'm not sure how to test something involving a Hadoop setting.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or wh  it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-03T02:49:31Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T18:22:21Z","closed_at":"2020-03-17T18:20:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c5fcd0542c59d90e41f8f04478f8a2e1125fe076","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBetter performance if the given index for `removeAllByIndexValues` is the natural key index in \r\n`InMemoryStore`\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nEnhance the existing test.","created_at":"2020-03-02T20:31:03Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T11:34:32Z","closed_at":"2020-03-03T11:34:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"801ebf05c11e8b1367b7a883863584ddd7e7fc5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/60ed5d0122d84d4581027656e63752a93706bda3","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:useNaturalIndex","ref":"useNaturalIndex","sha":"60ed5d0122d84d4581027656e63752a93706bda3","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the bug of UnsafeRow which misses to handle the UDT specifically, in `isFixedLength` and `isMutable`. These methods don't check its SQL type for UDT, always treating UDT as variable-length, and non-mutable.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't bring any issue if UDT is used to represent complicated type, but when UDT is used to represent some type which is matched with fixed length of SQL type, it exposes the chance of correctness issues, as these informations sometimes decide how the value should be handled.\r\n\r\nWe got report from user mailing list which suspected as mapGroupsWithState looks like handling UDT incorrectly, but after some investigation it was from GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner in shuffle phase.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0e2ca11d80c3921387d7b077cb64c3a0c06b08d7/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/codegen/GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner.scala#L32-L43\r\n\r\nHere updating position should not happen on fixed-length column, but due to this bug, the value of UDT having fixed-length as sql type would be modified, which actually corrupts the value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMisclassifying of the type of length for UDT can corrupt the value when the row is presented to the input of GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner, which brings correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`StreamingQueryStatisticsPage` shows a message \"No visualization information available because there is no batches\" instead of showing empty timelines and histograms for empty streaming queries.\r\n\r\n[Before this change applied]\r\n![before-fix-for-empty-streaming-query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/75642391-b32e1d80-5c7e-11ea-9c07-e2f0f1b5b4f9.png)\r\n\r\n[After this change applied]\r\n![after-fix-for-empty-streaming-query2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/75694583-1904be80-5cec-11ea-9b13-dc7078775188.png)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nEmpty charts are ugly and a little bit confusing.\r\nIt's better to clearly say \"No visualization information available\".\r\n\r\nAlso, this change fixes a JS error shown in the capture above.\r\nThis error occurs because `drawTimeline` in `streaming-page.js` is called even though `formattedDate` will be `undefined` for empty streaming queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. screen captures are shown above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually tested by creating an empty streaming query like as follows.\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.readStream.format(\"socket\").options(Map(\"host\"->\"<non-existing hostname>\", \"port\"->\"...\")).load\r\ndf.writeStream.format(\"console\").start\r\n```\r\nThis streaming query will fail because of `non-existing hostname` and has no

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes several incorrect uses of `assume()` in our tests.\r\n\r\nIf a call to `assume(condition)` fails then it will cause the test to be marked as skipped instead of failed: this feature allows test cases to be skipped if certain prerequisites are missing. For example, we use this to skip certain tests when running on Windows (or when Python dependencies are unavailable).\r\n\r\nIn contrast, `assert(condition)` will fail the test if the condition doesn't hold.\r\n\r\nIf `assume()` is accidentally substituted for `assert()`then the resulting test will be marked as skipped in cases where it should have failed, undermining the purpose of the test.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes several such cases, replacing certain `assume()` calls with `assert()`.\r\n\r\nCredit to @ahirreddy for spotting this problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change `DateTimeUtils.stringToTimestamp` to support any valid time zone id at the end of input string. After the changes, the function accepts zone ids in the formats:\r\n- no zone id. In that case, the function uses the local session time zone from the SQL config `spark.sql.session.timeZone`\r\n- -[h]h:[m]m\r\n- +[h]h:[m]m\r\n- Z\r\n- Short zone id, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html#SHORT_IDS\r\n- Zone ID starts with 'UTC+', 'UTC-', 'GMT+', 'GMT-', 'UT+' or 'UT-'. The ID is split in two, with a two or three letter prefix and a suffix starting with the sign. The suffix must be in the formats:\r\n  - +|-h[h]\r\n  - +|-hh[:]mm\r\n  - +|-hh:mm:ss\r\n  - +|-hhmmss\r\n- Region-based zone IDs in the form `{area}/{city}`, such as `Europe/Paris` or `America/New_York`. The default set of region ids is supplied by the IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To use `stringToTimestamp` as a substitution of removed `stringToTime`, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27710#discussion_r385020173\r\n- Improve UX of Spark SQL by allowing flexible formats of zone ids. Currently, Spark accepts only `Z` and zone offsets that can be inconvenient when a time zone offset is shifted due to daylight saving rules. For instance:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select cast('2015-03-18T12:03:17.123456 Europe/Moscow' as timestamp);\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, casting strings to timestamps allows time zone id at the end of the strings:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select cast('2015-03-18T12:03:17.123456 Europe/Moscow' as timestamp);\r\n2015-03-18 12:03:17.123456\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added new test cases to the `string to timestamp` test in `DateTimeUtilsSuite`.\r\n- Run `CastSuite` and `AnsiCastSuite`.","created_at":"2020-03-01T18:36:33Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:18Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T12:50:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"190937b04218bf19f70250cb99b0e1f9c628d496","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27753/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27753/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27753/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00a07ab500b63cb13edcd8bf71ad709d008e2d5b","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:stringToTimestamp-uni-zoneId","ref":"stringToTimestamp-uni-zoneId","sha":"00a07ab500b63cb13edcd8bf71ad709d008e2d5b","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to not cancel a `QueryStageExec` which failed before calling `doMaterialize`.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR also includes 2 minor improvements:\r\n\r\n* fail fast when stage failed before calling `doMaterialize`\r\n\r\n* format Exception with Cause\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor a stage which failed before materializing the lazy value (e.g. `inputRDD`), calling `cancel` on it could re-trigger the same failure again, e.g. executing child node again(see `AdaptiveQueryExecSuite`.`SPARK-30291: AQE should catch the exceptions when doing materialize` for example). And finally, the same failure will be counted 2 times, one is for materialize error and another is for cancel error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-01T15:56:50Z","updated_at":"2020-03-04T04:57:06Z","closed_at":"2020-03-03T21:40:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8192bcea3c6c3fbb41f70c006e86541ab89e0715","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27752/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27752/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27752/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/654d9d33bbffdaee7d818f938dd6a1f271208c0d","head":{"label":"Ngone51:avoid_cancel_finished_stage","ref":"avoid_cancel_finished_stage","sha":"654d9d33bbffdaee7d818f938dd6a1f271208c0d","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the bug of UnsafeRow which misses to handle the UDT specifically, in `isFixedLength` and `isMutable`. These methods don't check its SQL type for UDT, always treating UDT as variable-length, and non-mutable.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't bring any issue if UDT is used to represent complicated type, but when UDT is used to represent some type which is matched with fixed length of SQL type, it exposes the chance of correctness issues, as these informations sometimes decide how the value should be handled.\r\n\r\nWe got report from user mailing list which suspected as mapGroupsWithState looks like handling UDT incorrectly, but after some investigation it was from GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner in shuffle phase.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0e2ca11d80c3921387d7b077cb64c3a0c06b08d7/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/codegen/GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner.scala#L32-L43\r\n\r\nHere updating position should not happen on fixed-length column, but due to this bug, the value of UDT having fixed-length as sql type would be modified, which actually corrupts the value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMisclassifying of the type of length for UDT can corrupt the value when the row is presented to the input of GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner, which brings correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT
