VM compiler does not support lowering shape function for a primitive function that calls another, nested functions, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef @tvmgen_default_test_main_0(%test_0_i0: Tensor[(?, 16), float32], %test_0_i1: Tensor[(?, 16), float32], Inline=1, Compiler=\"test\", global_symbol=\"tvmgen_default_test_main_0\", Primitive=1) -> Tensor[(?, ?), float32] {\r\n  %0 = fn (%FunctionVar_0_0: Tensor[(?, 16), float32], %FunctionVar_0_1: Tensor[(?, 16), float32], PartitionedFromPattern=\"nn.dense_\", Composite=\"test.dense\") -> Tensor[(?, ?), float32] {\r\n    nn.dense(%FunctionVar_0_0, %FunctionVar_0_1, units=None) /* ty=Tensor[(?, ?), float32] */\r\n  };\r\n  %0(%test_0_i0, %test_0_i1) /* ty=Tensor[(?, ?), float32] */\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nThe error will be raised at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/4c590a2c855217f4e60cfd18f8eb459e5ba467b8/src/relay/backend/te_compiler_cache.cc#L547\r\n\r\nHowever, a primitive function like this comes up in BYOC settings where `MergeComposite` is used. So the shape function lowering pass should be extended to support such use cases. \r\n\r\nThe change is simple. I simply visit the body of the callee function to propagate shape information. \r\n\r\nBuilding on this PR, I'll follow up with a PR that adds dynamic shape support to CUTLASS BYOC, where an end-to-end test will be added. \r\n\r\ncc @comaniac @zhiics @icemelon  @mbs-octoml

PR enables meta schedule to extract tasks from the high-level framework, in our particular case, Relay.\r\n\r\nA base class `IntegrationContext` is introduced as the context manager for both task extraction (observer mode) and tuned task injection (injector mode):\r\n- Derived class `TaskExtraction` serves as the observer mode to extract tasks from Relay\r\n- Derived class `ApplyHistoryBest` serves as the injector mode to inject the tuned task back to Relay\r\n\r\nThe primary API for task extraction is `meta_schedule.integration.extract_task`, which returns a list of tasks on both Relay and TIR-level.\r\n\r\nThe PR only handles task extraction, but doesn't include further work like:\r\n- Multi-dispatching from Relay to TE/TIR\r\n- Deduplication and similarity score calculation of extracted tasks\r\n- Relay TIR operator strategy\r\n- Layout rewriting\r\n\r\nCC: @mbrookhart @mbs-octoml @sunggg @zxybazh @Hzfengsy @YuchenJin @altanh

there~ This PR aims to enhance the `CompactBufferRegion` and `GetBlockAccessRegion` for conditional buffer accesses.\r\n\r\nCurrently, they are not aware of conditions, thus may produce non-tight region bound. Take crop as an example:\r\n```python\r\nwith T.block() as []:\r\n    B = T.alloc_buffer((16), dtypes=\"float32\")\r\n    for i in range(0, 20):\r\n        with T.block():\r\n            T.evaluate(T.if_then_else(2 <= i and i < 18, B[i - 2], 0.0, dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n```\r\nThe compact buffer pass would infer that the accessed region of B is B[-2:18] and re-allocate new buffer with size=18-(-2)=20, since it do not know B is only accessed if i in [2, 18).\r\n\r\nTo take conditions into consideration, the PR make several changes as described below:\r\n- Relax the buffer region just at the access point\r\n\r\n    If consider conditions, the domain map used to relax the buffer accesses is no longer uniform. Thus we can not simply collect all inner buffer accesses at block visit point and relax them all with `iter_dom_map_on_post_order_`.\r\n\r\n    As a workaround, the PR instead record the allocation point (index into `ancestor_loops_`) for each buffer, thus at buffer access visit point, it can know which loop vars should not relax (generally loops out of allocation scope). The function `VisitBufferAccess()` do not need to record the access onto stack, but relax and union the access region immediately, with a global maintained `dom_map_` aware of condition bounds. \r\n\r\n   - origin:  (1) visit block begin -> ... -> (2) visit inner buffer access (record access) -> ... ->  (3) visit block end (collect and relax all accesses in scope use same  `iter_dom_map_on_post_order_`) \r\n   - new:  (1) visit block begin -> ... -> (2) visit inner buffer access (relax and union with current `dom_map_`, take extra cost to exclude non-relaxed loop vars from dom_map_) -> ... ->  (3) visit block end\r\n\r\n- Implement visit logic of `tir.IfThenElse` and `tir.if_then_else()` call, and update var bounds deduced from condition in different branches.\r\n\r\n- Implement intset difference util func. If the global intset is A and deduced intset is B on condition, then the bounded intset on true branch is `Intersect(A, B)` and the bounded intset on false branch is `Difference(A, B)`.\r\n\r\n- Clear read/write annotation for non-opaque block in pass `ConvertBlocksToOpaque` (maybe illness)\r\n\r\n     `ConvertBlocksToOpaque` is the pass before `CompactBufferRegion`. Since block read/write annotations are non-conditional, the conditional access info will get lost when block with point access is converted.\r\n    ```python\r\n    for i in range(20):\r\n         with T.block():\r\n             T.reads([B[i-2]])\r\n             T.evaluate(T.if_then_else(2 <= i and i < 18, B[i - 2], 0.0, dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n    ```\r\n    For a buffer allocated out of block scope, the compact buffer pass currently do not look into detailed access in block scope but use block's annotations, thus still try to relax B[i - 2] without condition awareness. The PR try to overcome this problem by differentiate two circumstances:\r\n    - (1) the block is opaque with reads/writes annotations:  treat the block as opaque as before, just use annotations.\r\n    - (2) the block is opaque but reads/writes are empty: treat the block as \"transparent\" and try visit buffer accesses within

[Swin-Transoformer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer).  \r\n\r\nIn particular, `aten::roll` is an interesting op to implement and generally useful op to have. It can be implemented via `gather` but the encoding is not obvious. Here are the references:\r\nhttps://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.roll.html\r\nhttps://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.roll.html\r\n\r\nplease review @comaniac @jcf94 @junrushao1994 \r\n\r\n@Kyrie-Zhao `aten::rand` is not needed, it is used in dropout but if you trace the model with `eval` mode, dropout is gone.\r\n\r\nNow the following script works with the error `1.4081733e-07`.\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport tvm\r\nimport torch\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\nfrom swin_transformer import SwinTransformer\r\n\r\nnet = SwinTransformer().eval()\r\n\r\nimg =

Make sure FoldConstant can inline constants underneath on_device annotations\r\n\r\nAfter device planning and conversion to ANF we can end up with:\r\n```\r\n  let %x = on_device(constant, device_type=D)\r\n  ...\r\n  @f(..., %x, ...)\r\n```\r\nwhere the device D is not the same as the device for the let-expression itself. (eg D may be the CPU, %x a shape, and @f an allocation primitive that requires shapes to reside on the CPU). That's all consistent with the convention the DeviceAware* visitors expect for recovering device information. However, it means folding constant into @f's call site must both 'see' the constant underneath the on_device annotation and bring the on_device annotation along for the ride:\r\n```\r\n   @f(..., on_device(constant, device_type=D), ...)\r\n```\r\n  - Make FoldConstant be on_device aware\r\n  - Clean things up a bit while I'm there.\r\n  - Setup unit tests specifically for const folding with on_device annotations.\r\n  - Replacing `if __name__ == \"main\"` drivers for units tests with official incantation as I encounter them.\r\n  - Don't create `on_device(on_device(...))`\r\n  - Logging changes so A/B diffs can focus on just the pass of interest.\r\n  - Revert Index->DLDeviceType changes in the vm in case they are the cause of downstream problems.\r\n\r\n(CORE-102 in OctoML

pull request contributes two applications that show how to use the recently integrated TVM STM32 code generator:\r\n - The *SystemPerformance* application can be used for timing a model on a given board. \r\n - The *Validation* application can be used for testing and validating the TVM generated model implementations.\r\nTwo STM32 development boards are supported: the Discovery H747I and the Nucleo F412ZG. The two applications have been tested on these boards with a number of ML models such as TinyML, Yolo, Mobilnet, and others.\r\nUsers are referred to carefully read the README.md in the apps/microtvm/stm32 directory.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n1. These applications cannot be tested within the TVM CI infrastructure. However, they have been thouroughly tested with various models inside the ST Microelectronics.\r\n2. The C style formatting has been disabled in TVM CI for this applications because some code has been generated by the CubeMX tool and it makes sense to keep that formatting style for the contributed

PR fixes a bug in TIR schedule primitive `Bind`. The fix provides a regression unit test.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe bug will be triggered when binding a loop to a thread axis _where the block below the loop has a `init()` that contains a block_. \r\n* Originally the implementation of `Bind` will try to acquire the `StmtSRef` of the inside-init block, but since such blocks _have no corresponding `StmtSRef`_, the try for acquisition leads to runtime

PR updates TVM script parser/printer in the following aspects:\r\n* support parsing Python lambdas: a lambda can have arbitrary parameters and an arbitrary body;\r\n* support parsing `tir.CommReducer`:\r\n  * for single-group reducer, the syntax is like\r\n    ```python\r\n    tir.comm_reducer(lambda x, y: x + y, [tir.float32(0)])\r\n    ```\r\n  * for multiple-group reducer, the syntax is like\r\n    ```python\r\n    tir.comm_reducer(\r\n        lambda x0, x1, y0, y1: (tir.Select((x1 >= y1), x0, y0), tir.Select((x1 >= y1), x1, y1)),\r\n        [tir.int32(-1), tir.min_value(\"float32\")]\r\n    )\r\n    ```\r\n* support printing `tir.CommReducer` according to the syntax above (the old way and related stuffs to print `tir.CommReducer` is removed because they're outdated).\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR updates the constructor of `CommReducer` by\r\n1. checking whether the inputs `lhs`, `rhs`, `result` and `identity_element` all have the same length, and\r\n2. converting the data type of variables in `lhs` and `rhs` so that their data types are consistent with the data types in `identity_element`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy @junrushao1994

new Hexagon DeviceAPI is intended for cross compilation directly to Hexagon. This is distinct from the current device api which is compiled and run on the android arm CPU. This includes:\r\n* Custom TVM logging utilities to correctly log errors to mini-dm\r\n* DeviceAPI implementations AllocDataSpace and CopyDataFromTo which support for storage scopes\r\n* HexagonBuffer wrapper which manages the underlying allocation(s) and tracks the storage scope\r\n* Custom linked param lookup that wraps parameters in an unmanaged HexagonBuffer.\r\n* Custom hexagon shared library lookup that supports wrapping library function symbols with a custom calling convention that unpacks HexagonBuffers prior to invocation.\r\n\r\nAlternatives: Internally cache HexagonBuffer structure

review.","created_at":"2021-10-22T16:29:34Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T21:40:56Z","closed_at":"2021-10-26T21:40:56Z","merged_at":"2021-10-26T21:40:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"404fbf73e4429e7879457af0f07484f54217fa43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kazum","id":812126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjEyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum","html_url":"https://github.com/kazum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"liangfu","id":857821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NzgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/857821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu","html_url":"https://github.com/liangfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403

community,\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in binding params for relay function. When we bind constant params for relay function, we hope to report the duplicated param names that we want to bind, but the current implementation does not. In the demo code:\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\n\r\na = relay.var('a', shape=(1,))\r\naa = relay.var('a', shape=(1,))\r\ns = a + aa\r\nfunc = relay.Function([a, aa], s)\r\nfunc = relay.build_module.bind_params_by_name(func, {'a': [1.0]})\r\n```\r\nthere are two variables with duplicated names, but we can bind the value to the first 'a'.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we will have the following error message:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"demo.py\", line 7, in <module>\r\n    func = relay.build_module.bind_params_by_name(func, {'a': [1.0]})\r\n  File

#9223 added a fast math flags setting to the LLVM codegen. The setting checks if the LLVM version is >= 6.0 and calls the below lines\r\n```\r\n    if (fast_math_contract) {\r\n      fmf.setAllowContract();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nRecent LLVM versions have a default argument of `true` to `llvm::FastMathFlags::setAllowContract()`. However, LLVM 6.0 does not have a default argument for that method, so this fails to compile because it expects an explicit argument. This PR makes the argument explicit to be compatible with LLVM 6.0 (the version my system happened to have).","created_at":"2021-10-21T05:28:17Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T11:09:37Z","closed_at":"2021-10-21T11:09:37Z","merged_at":"2021-10-21T11:09:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"88bf112454bbd30058719260e0fca9dd49c8692e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vinx13","id":7195739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTU3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13","html_url":"https://github.com/vinx13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinx13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"reques

old kernel_layout convention was incorrect for conv2d_transpose. They mixed up `I` and `O`. \r\n\r\nE.g. if we had a conv with 5 input channels and 10 output channels with height and width of 3 the weight for `IOHW` would be `[10, 5, 3, 3]` instead of `[5, 10, 3, 3]`. Likewise for `OIHW` we would have `[5, 10, 3, 3]` instead of `[10, 5, 3, 3]`. This is extremely confusing and several times within the codebase people note the \"convention\" for \"O\" and \"I\" is flipped.  \r\n\r\nThis is just wrong I believe. `I` and `O` should be related to the input and output channels of the convolution only.\r\n\r\nWhy was the confusion here in first case? The actual topi assume IOHW kernel inputs and we layout transform to achieve this. It seems for regular convs we are used to OIHW layouts which is why we might have had the confusion. Indeed in PyTorch, conv2d_transpose weights follow IOHW convention:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> nn.ConvTranspose2d(10, 30, 5, groups=2).state_dict()['weight'].shape\r\ntorch.Size([10, 15, 5, 5])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile conv2d follow OIHW:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> nn.Conv2d(10, 30, 5, groups=2).state_dict()['weight'].shape\r\ntorch.Size([30, 5, 5, 5])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has caused me a great deal of confusion. It seems like the current code only works because people mix up the layout convention manually. E.g. the layout in the code is said to be OIHW but the shape of the tensor and how they run the calculation is done in IOHW.\r\n\r\nThis is my attempt at untying the knot and making it much more consistent.\r\n\r\nTODOs: \r\nMake pyxir remove this line and renable the skipped test for vitas.py:

I needed a new 'virtual devices' array in the executable so that instructions can continue to refer to devices by a simple index yet the VM can respect both the device type and id for runtime devices. \r\n\r\nContinuing from #9313, and as part of apache/tvm-rfcs#38, we switch PlanDevices to plan with respect to SEScopes instead of just DLDeviceTypes. Our ultimate goal is to be able to flow memory scopes between PrimFuncs by re-running PlanDevices after the LowerTE pass. This PR at least gets us to being able to flow the memory scopes, but the actual changes to PlanDevices to look inside PrimFuncs is still two PR's in the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, we get two nice side effects right away:\r\n  - Since SEScopes contain Targets we can isolate all the device-to-target resolution machinery within PlanDevices (with the help of CompilationConfig). After PlanDevices has run we can retrieve the Target for any sub-expression directly from that sub-expression's SEScope. For now we retain the one-Target-per-DLDeviceType constraint since it baked into the public 'TargetMap' API, but the path to breaking that constraint is clearer.\r\n  - Device ids are now respected all the way from annotation to executor. Previously though we had a bit of plumbing using Devices the device_id therein was ignored or defaulted to zero.  The Python \"on_device\" annotation helpers still work w.r.t. devices. Thus though they now respect device ids, they do not allow the user to specify a Target or memory scope as supported by the underlying

generate_project API method is copying the input MLF archive\r\nfilename without renaming it to \"model.tar\" - hence not in accordance\r\nwith the specification. As a consequence when the server looks for that\r\nfile to determine if it's a project dir or a template dir it always\r\ndetermines it is a template dir since \"model.tar\" can never be found, so\r\na TemplateProjectError() exception is thrown when instantiating a\r\nGeneratedProject class.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes that by correctly copying the input MLF archive to\r\nthe newly generated project dir as \"model.tar\" so the server can find\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt also takes the chance to change the MLF path returned by\r\nserver_info_query method: only if it's not a template dir the MLF path\r\nis returned, otherwise an empty string is returned (it doesn't make\r\nsense to return a MLF path when it's a template dir because there isn't\r\nany model associated to a template dir).\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

is the first step in https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/pull/38 to bring devices, targets and memory scopes together when doing device planning as a new 'SEScope' class. For now memory scopes will be left as \"\", but will become significant in follow on PRs.\r\n\r\nOnce device planning works in units of SEScopes it will be possible to directly read off the device and target for any Relay sub-expression without the need for TargetMaps or the construction of default Targets.\r\n\r\nSEScopes also support 'Join' and 'Default' operations needed when constraint solving in the device planner.\r\n\r\nThis PR also brings some duplicated and ad-hoc 'default target' handling logic together into a CompilationConfig class. This came along with SEScope since it:\r\n  a) establishes the default SEScope for primitive ops, needed by device planning when sub-expressions are not otherwise constrained to a particular device/target.\r\n  b) establishes the SEScope for the 'host', which is needed by device planning and the VM for shape data, shape functions, and other non-tensor data/computations.\r\n  c) provides a way to 'canonicalize' SEScopes which may enter device planning via annotations which are missing their target. \r\n\r\nThese classes will be used in the sequel PR

this PR, I change `Call` with `TIRCallAttrs` to a relay op called call_lowered. (I also rename `CallTIRAttrs` to `CallLoweredAttrs`). This means that after lowering, calls are of the form `Call(\"call_lowered\", [fn: GlobalVar, args: Tuple] Attrs(CallLoweredAttrs))`. \r\n\r\nOne benefit to this approach is it is easy to identify calls to lowered functions-- instead of checking the type of the call's attributes, we can just check what the op is. This is especially helpful for passes that run both before an after lowering, like device planning and memory allocation. \r\n\r\nI left the calling convention for extern functions as-is. A codegened extern call looks like this: `Call(fn: GlobalVar, [arg1: Expr, ... argn: Expr], Attrs()) `with null attributes. In the future we will probably need to change the extern calling convention to have attributes that store information like the target, but that is outside the scope of this work.

PR introduces a tutorial for running TVM on Arm(R) Cortex(R)-M55 CPU and Ethos(TM)-U55 NPU, using bare metal.\r\n\r\nIn order to run the application without having access to a Cortex(R)-M55 and Ethos(TM)-U55 development board, the sample application will be run on a Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP). The FVP based on Arm(R) Corstone(TM)-300 software, models a hardware system containing a Cortex(R)-M55 and Ethos(TM)-U55.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial compiles a MobileNet v1 model and instructs TVM to offload operators to the Ethos(TM)-U55 where possible.\r\n\r\n@manupa-arm @Mousius @leandron @areusch

PR adds support for `return_sequences` bool param for [Keras LSTM layer](https://keras.io/api/layers/recurrent_layers/lstm/).\r\nBy default the param is False - LSTM returns only the last h output\r\nIf `return_sequences is True` then ALL h outputs should be returned. The outputs should be concatenated along axis 1.\r\n\r\nI also added dedicated test for LSTM. Input shape increased to test `return_sequences is True` case.\r\n\r\n`return_sequences = True` is needed if your model has two or more LSTM layers. By Default LSTM layer takes 3D tensor and returns 2D tensor. To connect two LSTM layers together the first layers should return 3D tensor. It can be achieved if `return_sequences param` set to `True`.\r\n\r\n[Understanding LSTM Networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)\r\n\r\nRelated discussion
