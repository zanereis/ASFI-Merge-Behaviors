For now, we wrap if needed, but cleaning up the inconsistency would improve SDK throughput.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, when staticcheck or vet fail, they exit with non-zero exit codes and don't render their output. This allows the output to render correctly. Both tools are guaranteed to exit with non-zero exit codes on failure, so this will still correctly fail when there are issues.\r\n\r\n\"Vet's exit code is non-zero for erroneous invocation of the tool or if a problem was reported, and 0 otherwise. Note that the tool does not check every possible problem and depends on unreliable heuristics, so it should be used as guidance only, not as a firm indicator of program correctness.\" - https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet#pkg-overview\r\n\r\nStaticcheck is less cleanly documented, so I'll include an example of it failing + rendering output on CI - https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/3787405891/jobs/6439178002 - that is from my second temporarily bad commit on this PR\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Changed</h1>\n<h2>⚠️ Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>Given the amount of issues after <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/476\">#476</a>, causing consumers of this library to update their dependencies with multiple replace directives in their <code>go.mod</code> files, we have moved compose code to a separate module. Therefore the majority of the users of the library will only need to replace Docker dependency with the one used in this library, which is simpler in terms of usage. Please see <a href=\"https://golang.testcontainers.org/quickstart/#2-install-testcontainers-for-go\">Install instructions</a> for further information.</p>\n<pre lang=\"golang\"><code>replace (\n\tgithub.com/docker/docker =&gt; github.com/docker/docker v20.10.3-0.20221013203545-33ab36d6b304+incompatible // 22.06 branch\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>On the other hand, users of native Docker Compose code will still need all the replace directives, as described in the <a href=\"https://golang.testcontainers.org/features/docker_compose/\">Compose docs</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chore: move compose code to

now, when we process a command, if that command changes the label set we have the potential to overwrite earlier label changes. This is generally not a problem, but when we've already removed the slow-review label it can add it back.

we implement the basic support for multifile examples, and enable all Python multifile examples, so that we could show them when frontend is ready\r\n\r\n- [x] proto API updated and backend/frontend stubs generated\r\n- [x] buf.gen.yaml extended to generate also playground/infrastructure stubs\r\n- [x] RunCode accepts `files` along with `code` to be compatible with old frontend API client\r\n- [x] GetPrecompiledObjectCode has `files` and `code` for the same reason\r\n- [x] some Python examples which were marked multifile became single-file\r\n\r\n__note__ though, sometimes in Backend unittests I used `main.java` as a mock import name,\r\nJava needs far more work in so-called \"preparers\" part: we need to prepare import files too.\r\nGo currently has no multifile examples, my guess I that it would work with only minor adjustments.\r\n\r\n### Examples layout\r\nMultifile examples have the following fields in `beam-playgroun` tag:\r\n```\r\n# multifile: true\r\n# files:\r\n#  - name: import.py\r\n```\r\nSome multifile examples cannot be run on Playground yet: they don't have `files` and are skipped by Examples CI/CD\r\n\r\n\r\n[Design of example tag

part of the [Beam Release Process](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/release-guide/) migration to GitHub Actions, the following PR updates the [build_release_candidate.sh](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/7c55f7668b1c2ec96c491ecfd05b0e902dbaf23a/release/src/main/scripts/build_release_candidate.sh#L352) script into the final steps which publishes and updates the beam-site repository with the corresponding docs.\r\n\r\nThis `workflow` will be run after [build_release_candidate.sh](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/24684) had been run, since it still publishes the artifacts into the corresponding repositories with the RM credentials that are stored locally.\r\n\r\nIn order for the `workflow` works, a `SSH Key` is required for this workflow can submit and push the changes into the `beam-site` repository. \r\n\r\nSteps to set SSH Key:\r\n- Generate SSH Key locally\r\n- Upload and set into `beam-site` the deploy key (Go to beam-site repository / Settings / Security - Deploy Keys ) using the public key\r\n- Generate a `Secret` (In Beam repository - Settings / Secrets / Actions / New Repository Secret ) in the `beam` repository with the private ssh key which was generated locally, applying the `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY` as key and private ssh key as value.\r\n\r\n*Note: You can check the [following approach](https://cpina.github.io/push-to-another-repository-docs/setup-using-ssh-deploy-keys.html#setup-ssh-deploy-keys) which was used as based for the current behaviour.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#24645\r\n\r\n### Unify CI and CD logic\r\nTo use the same code for examples validation, to make CD step more stable\r\nSpecifically, `ci_helper.CIHelper` and `cd_helper::CDHelper` were merged into `verify::Verifier`\r\n\r\n### Use [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) instead of hand-written validators\r\nTo optimize `beam-playground` tag content verification and other example's properties\r\nEasy-to-implement additional validators (and enrichers that were scattered across the code)\r\nFound a context_line bug in one of Python katas, after applying line_context validators.\r\n\r\n### Kafka examples tag: make `emulators` a list\r\n__note__ Playground API isn't changed\r\nIt makes the logic more maintainable, reduces \"1 emulator, 1 dataset\" limitation of the initial version of code\r\n\r\n### Unittest\r\nPytest common fixtures to create Example/Tag objects, revised test_helper.py\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[github.com/tetratelabs/wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) from 1.0.0-pre.4 to 1.0.0-pre.5.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>wazero v1.0.0-pre.5 improves debugability. It also makes some API changes that reduce its surface area.</p>\n<p>We did an early release to allow the few folks impacted by API changes to test them prior to our normal month-end release. Most users should wait for v1.0.0-pre.6, which will include better performance, as well the ability to create new files.</p>\n<p>On that note, we'll remind we have a <a href=\"https://gophers.slack.com/\">gophers slack</a> <code>#wazero</code> channel for support, updates and conversation! Note: You may need an <a href=\"https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/\">invite</a> to join gophers. If you like what we are doing, please <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/stargazers\">star</a> our repo as folks appreciate it.</p>\n<h2>Better stack traces</h2>\n<p>Those who compile &quot;debug&quot; wasm will appreciate better looking stack traces on error.</p>\n<p>Before, a stack trace message looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>wasm stack trace:\n        .runtime._panic(i32)\n        .c()\n        .b()\n        .a()\n        .main.main()\n        .runtime.run()\n        ._start()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, if the <code>%.wasm</code> includes DWARF debug info (usually a <code>debug</code> build), stack traces look a lot more precise:</p>\n<pre><code>wasm stack trace:\n        .runtime._panic(i32)\n                0x16e2: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tinygo/0.26.0/src/runtime/runtime_tinygowasm.go:73:6 (inlined)\n                        /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tinygo/0.26.0/src/runtime/panic.go:52:7\n        .c()\n                0x1911: /Users/mathetake/wazero/internal/testing/dwarftestdata/testdata/tinygo/main.go:19:7\n        .b()\n                0x1901: /Users/mathetake/wazero/internal/testing/dwarftestdata/testdata/tinygo/main.go:14:3\n        .a()\n                0x18f7: /Users/mathetake/wazero/internal/testing/dwarftestdata/testdata/tinygo/main.go:9:3\n        .main.main()\n                0x18ed: /Users/mathetake/wazero/internal/testing/dwarftestdata/testdata/tinygo/main.go:4:3\n        .runtime.run()\n                0x18cc: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tinygo/0.26.0/src/runtime/scheduler_none.go:26:10\n        ._start()\n                0x18b6: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tinygo/0.26.0/src/runtime/runtime_wasm_wasi.go:22:5\n</code></pre>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> for the work on this, which was easier due to standard libraries in Go.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we added <code>logging.NewHostLoggingListenerFactory</code> for those only interested in host function calls. This reduces the volume of logging considerably for those trying to troubleshoot their custom functions.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt\"><code>@​codefromthecrypt</code></a> for the work making things easier to understand.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.  (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9819\">#9819</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the aarch64 build on macOS until it can be fixed. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9816\">#9816</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1-rc1</h2>\n<p>#PHP</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>#Other</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.0</h2>\n<p>2022-03-25 version 3.20.0 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Objective-C/C#/Ruby/JavaScript)</p>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped Ruby 2.3 and 2.4 support for CI and releases. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9311\">#9311</a>)</li>\n<li>Added Ruby 3.1 support for CI and releases (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9566\">#9566</a>).</li>\n<li>Message.decode/encode: Add recursion_limit option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9218\">#9218</a>/<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9486\">#9486</a>)</li>\n<li>Allocate with xrealloc()/xfree() so message allocation is visible to the\nRuby GC.  In certain tests this leads to much lower memory usage due to more\nfrequent GC runs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9586\">#9586</a>).</li>\n<li>Fix conversion of singleton classes in Ruby (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9342\">#9342</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

PR closes #24664 by adding an explicit and ignored InterrptedException catch and moving the shutdownNow of sdkHarnessExecutor and serverExecutor in the finally clause.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/3690463659/jobs/6247487642 reports the error stack trace:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.beam.fn.harness.jmh.ProcessBundleBenchmarkTest > testStateWithCaching FAILED\r\n    java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException at ProcessBundleBenchmarkTest.java:54\r\n        Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException at ProcessBundleBenchmark.java:175\r\n            Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException at UnboundedScheduledExecutorService.java:316\r\n                Caused by: java.lang.InterruptedException at FutureTask.java:418\r\n```\r\n\r\n[ProcessBundleBenchmarkTest.java:54](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/harness/jmh/src/test/java/org/apache/beam/fn/harness/jmh/ProcessBundleBenchmarkTest.java#L54) occurs when the code invokes tearDown:\r\n```\r\n     StatefulTransform transform = new StatefulTransform();\r\n     new ProcessBundleBenchmark().testStateWithCaching(transform);\r\n-->  transform.tearDown();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `StatefulTransform` extends `SdkHarness`, we find the tearDown method code at [ProcessBundleBenchmark.java#L200-L201](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/harness/jmh/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/fn/harness/jmh/ProcessBundleBenchmark.java#L200-L201).  Noteably, an `//expected` code comment suggests that at tearDown, we expect an InterruptedException.  However, when sdkHarnessExecutorFuture.get(); is invoked, we still see `Caused by: java.lang.InterruptedException at FutureTask.java:418`\r\n```\r\n      try {\r\n        sdkHarnessExecutorFuture.get();\r\n      } catch (ExecutionException e) {\r\n        if (e.getCause() instanceof RuntimeException\r\n  ----> && e.getCause().getCause() instanceof InterruptedException) {\r\n  ----> // expected\r\n        } else {\r\n          throw e;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy refactoring as follows, we may have prevented the re-throwing of `InterruptedException`.\r\n```\r\ncatch (InterruptedException ignored) {\r\n        // expected\r\n      } catch (Exception e) {\r\n        throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n      } finally {\r\n        sdkHarnessExecutor.shutdownNow();\r\n        serverExecutor.shutdownNow();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Go SDK is fairly stable WRT it's FnAPI behavior, but prior to 2.45.0 the SDK would return errors on benign split failures. This has been determined to be incorrect behavior (the failures, if they don't cause dataloss or corruption, should have returned empty splits).\r\n\r\nHowever, to support variable behavior on these split failures and become intolerant of them in the future, we need to finally have a versioned base SDK capability. \r\n\r\nThis change builds off of the automatically incrementing SDK version on releases, and makes the default image constant clearer in the core.\r\n\r\nFixes #20287\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#24575 and implements a MongoDB IO connector for the Go SDK with the following transforms:\r\n- `mongodbio.Read` reads documents from a MongoDB collection into a PCollection\r\n- `mongodbio.Write` writes elements from a PCollection to a MongoDB collection. If the struct element has a field with the bson tag \"_id\", the value of the field is used as the document id. If not, a new id of type `primitive.ObjectID` is generated\r\n\r\nThe Read transform follows a similar pattern as the Java and Python SDKs, where the MongoDB internal splitVector command is used by default, but it is possible to configure the transform to use a bucketAuto aggregation instead to support reads from MongoDB Atlas.\r\n\r\nPipelines using the Read and Write transforms have been run successfully with DirectRunner and DataflowRunner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
