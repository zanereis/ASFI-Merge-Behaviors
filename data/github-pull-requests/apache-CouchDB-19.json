Overview\r\n\r\nSometime it is useful to be able to trigger open tracing using single header in the request. \r\nFor such cases this PR introduces `X-Couch-Trace` header.

if the metadata key is bumped in a transaction the same transaction\r\ncould not be used to add jobs with `couch_jobs`. That's because metadata is a\r\nversionstamped value, and when set, it cannot be read back until that\r\ntransaction has committed. In `fabric2_fdb` there is a process dict key that is\r\nset which declares that metadata was already read, which happens before any db\r\nupdate, however `couch_jobs` uses it's own caching mechanism and doesn't know\r\nabout that pdict key.\r\n\r\nIt would be tempting to re-use the same pdict key and just set it from\r\nwhichever module calls `ensure_current`, however that would be incorrect, as\r\nthe two modules don't actually share the same `Db` handle objects, so they do\r\nneed to re-read the most recent key.\r\n\r\nIdeally we'd implement a single `couch_fdb` module to be shared between\r\n`couch_jobs` and `fabric2_db` but until then it maybe simpler to just let\r\n`couch_jobs` use its own metadata key. This way, it doesn't get invalidated or\r\nbumped every time dbs get recreated or design docs are updated. The only time\r\nit would be bumped is if the FDB layer prefix changed at

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n* Allows `configure.ps1` to correctly pull and build `rebar` on a Windows machine;\r\n* Removes the static declarations in `rebar.config.script` on specific, pre-determined paths to various includes/libraries necessary for NIFs and external binaries (expectation is these are passed in env vars INCLUDE, LIB and LIBPATH);\r\n* fixes the SM60 `couchjs` build by telling `windows.h` not to redefine min and max as macros through a `#define`\r\n* fixes the `make eunit` target on Windows\r\n* Adds the missing `EXE_LINK_CXX_TEMPLATE` that our rebar doesn't have, but `enc` has today, which is also causing a failed `couchjs` (C++) build on Windows\r\n* Causes `make python-black` to correctly cause failure in `make check` if it finds problems\r\n* fixes Mango tests on Python 3.8 by bumping the hypothesis dependency\r\n* fixes one Elixir test on Windows (incorrect calculation of `now(:ms)` due to Erlang clock precision difference)\r\n* a little bit of

Overview\r\n\r\nThe B3 header parsing introduced in https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2309 is broken. When b3 header is set the chttpd request is crashing with the following message:\r\n```\r\n[error] 2020-02-03T21:25:39.049590Z dbcore@172.30.138.101 <0.23004.0> -------- CRASH REPORT Process  (<0.23004.0>) with 0 neighbors crashed with reason: bad argument in call to binary:split(\"C10B5B9C9F06385D04BD6B3A57971D8C-1AEA26A4FE496E13-0000000000000000\", <<\"-\">>, [global]) at \r\n   chttpd:get_trace_headers/1(line:1305) \r\n   <= chttpd:root_span_options/1(line:1271) \r\n   <= chttpd:start_span/1(line:1253) \r\n   <= chttpd:before_request/1(line:270) \r\n   <= chttpd:handle_request_int/1(line:243) \r\n   <= mochiweb_http:headers/6(line:128) \r\n   <= proc_lib:init_p_do_apply/3(line:247); \r\ninitial_call: {mochiweb_acceptor,init,['Argument__1','Argument__2',...]}, \r\nancestors: [chttpd,chttpd_sup,<0.452.0>], \r\nmessage_queue_len: 0, \r\nmessages: [], \r\nlinks: [<0.455.0>,#Port<0.16978>], \r\ndictionary: [{dont_log_request,true},{ctrace_is_enabled,true},{nonce,\"7f8a471...\"},...], \r\ntrap_exit: false, \r\nstatus: running, \r\nheap_size: 2586, \r\nstack_size: 27, \r\nreductions: 4211 \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for the crash is obvious. The `binary:split/3` is used in the place where we have string as an argument. According to the code in [mochiweb_headers.erl](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-mochiweb/blob/master/src/mochiweb_headers.erl#L196) the headers are always strings. This PR switches from `binary:split/3` to `string:split/3`. In order to make sure the change is working as expected the test is written. There was a need to adjust some testing plumbing to make test pass. This adjustment was done in the same PR since it is the very first test of this kind and testing adjustment in separate PR would be quite tricky. The adjustment to test plumbing consists of two changes:\r\n- Update httpotion to 3.1.3 --- cherry pick from master \r\n- Support setting base_url in Couch test helper --- this is needed in the context of unit tests when http port is dynamic\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. checkout PR\r\n2. run test `make exunit apps=chttpd` - the test should pass\r\n3. revert `3b9f04db97` locally and run test again - the test should timeout \r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2309\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

Overview\r\n\r\nIn #2336 we removed node-local HTTP access and redirected all traffic through `/_node/{node-name}/...`. This sneakily routes a new MochiWeb request through to couch_httpd under the covers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the process we ended up URL-decoding the URL, meaning the passed-through URL couldn't include `%2F` for accessing individual shards.\r\n\r\nThis reintroduces URL encoding to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nIt also introduces support to query a specific view shard through `/_node/{node-name}/{db-shard}/{ddoc}/`. This allows inspection of individual view shard sizes.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/run -n 1 -a admin:password\r\ncurl -X PUT http://admin:password@localhost:15984/abc\r\ncurl

despite its irrelevancy\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in

images have updated versions of Erlang - so Jenkinsfile must follow.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this breaks PRs until this PR is merged, because now `couchdbdev/debian-buster-erlang-all` has different versions of Erlang in it than `Jenkinsfile.pr` does.\r\n\r\nWe can possibly factor some of this out and avoid the PR-blocking change by having the `-all` image have aliases like `/usr/local/kerl/{low,medium,high}/activate` to the three versions.\r\n\r\nThe `Jenkinsfile.full` version needs to be explicit so that packages are built appropriately for downstream.\r\n\r\nAt one point @kocolosk wanted to use tagging to improve build times and avoid the forced pull every time, but my experience was that when tags move, docker doesn't always pick it up, leading us back to having to merge a PR every time we want or need to update the Erlang in our
