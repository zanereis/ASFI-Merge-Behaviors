Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, servers and tasks download all broadcast datasources. While the downloading of bootstrap segments is generally fast, as it happens in parallel during startup, it does consume storage space. This is especially relevant for tasks like kill tasks and MSQ worker tasks, which either don't need to load any broadcast datasources or only selectively load those that are required. This optimization will save task storage space and speed up the task startup time a bit.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe design for loading broadcast datasources follows a similar approach to what was implemented for loading lookups in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16328. \r\n\r\nBroadcast datasources can be specified in SQL queries through `JOIN` and `FROM` clauses, or obtained from other sources such as lookups.To this effect, we have introduced a `BroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec`. Finding the set of broadcast datasources during SQL planning will be done in a follow-up, which will apply only to MSQ tasks,  so they load only required broadcast datasources. This PR primarily focuses on the skeletal changes around `BroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec` and integrating it from the `Task` interface via `CliPeon` to `SegmentBootstrapper`.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\n\r\n- Added `BroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec` class and `Task.getBroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec()` tasks to control how broadcast datasources are loaded.\r\n   - The supported broadcast datasource loading modes are `ALL`, `NONE` and `ONLY_REQUIRED`.\r\n   - By default, all tasks will load all broadcast datasources. \r\n   - The `KillTask` and `MSQControllerTask` override `getBroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec()` to `NONE`.\r\n- The `CliPeon` initializes the broadcast module by parsing the command line option `--loadBroadcastDatasourceMode`.\r\n- The CLIPeon option `--loadBroadcastSegments` have been marked as deprecated in favor of `--loadBroadcastDatasourceMode`. This can be removed in a future release.\r\n- The `PodTemplateTaskAdapter` and `K8sTaskAdapter` support wiring for the option `LOAD_BROADCAST_DATASOURCE_MODE`, similar to existing `LOAD_BROADCAST_SEGMENTS`.\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n- Data servers load _all_ broadcast datasources.\r\n- By default, all tasks load _all_ broadcast datasources unless an override exists.\r\n- MSQ Controller and Kill tasks do _not_ load any broadcast datasources.\r\n- In a future patch, MSQ ingest and query tasks will _selectively_ load segments pertaining to the broadcast datasources determined as part of query planning. This will be addressed in a follow-up.\r\n\r\n#### Release note:\r\n\r\nTasks control the loading of broadcast datasources via `BroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec getBroadcastDatasourceLoadingSpec()`. By default, tasks download all broadcast datasources, unless there's an override as with kill and MSQ controller task. \r\n\r\nThe `CLIPeon` command line option `--loadBroadcastSegments` is deprecated in favor of `--loadBroadcastDatasourceMode`.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-10T15:21:53Z","updated_at":"2024-10-01T03:18:46Z","closed_at":"2024-09-12T17:30:29Z","merged_at":"2024-09-12T17:30:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ef94c9deebea6cc52dcc504b83f451c73d5c036","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

issue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\n\r\nThis PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16890 introduced a change to skip adding tombstone segments to the cache. \r\nIt turns out that as a side effect tombstone segments appear unavailable in the console. This happens because availability of a segment in Broker is determined from the metadata cache. \r\n\r\nThe fix is to keep the segment in the metadata cache but skip them from refresh. \r\n\r\nThis doesn't affect any functionality as metadata query for tombstone returns empty causing continuous refresh of those segments.

Fixed vulnerabilities \r\n\r\n* CVE-2021-26291 : Apache Maven is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Various\r\nfunctions across several files, mentioned below, allow for custom repositories to use the\r\ninsecure HTTP protocol. An attacker can exploit this as part of a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)\r\nattack, taking over or impersonating a repository using the insecure HTTP protocol.\r\nUnsuspecting users may then have the compromised repository defined as a dependency in\r\ntheir Project Object Model (pom) file and download potentially malicious files from it.\r\n\r\nWas fixed by removing outdated tesla-aether library containing vulnerable maven-settings (v3.1.1) package, pull-deps utility updated to use maven resolver instead.\r\n\r\n* sonatype-2020-0244 : The `joni` package is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.\r\nThis project downloads dependencies over HTTP due to an insecure repository configuration\r\nwithin the `.pom` file. Consequently, a MitM could intercept requests to the specified\r\nrepository and replace the requested dependencies with malicious versions, which can execute\r\narbitrary code from the application that was built with them.\r\n\r\nWas fixed by upgrading `joni` package to recommended 2.1.34 version\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

durable storage and export both require configuring a temporary directory to be used using `druid.export.storage.<connectorType>.tempLocalDir` and `druid.msq.intermediate.storage.tempDir`. \r\n\r\nTasks on middle manager already have a configured temporary directory. This PR aims to reduce the configuration required by using the task directory as a default if it is not explicitly configured, thus reducing the number of configs that a user has to set.\r\n\r\nPlease note that preference would be given to the user configured, `druid.*.storage.temp*Dir`, on the tasks. If that is not configured, we then use the `configured temporary directory`. \r\n\r\nOverlord and brokers also require storage connector configurations (for the durableStorageCleanerOverlordDuty and to fetch results of async queries respectively), but do not have a default temporary task directory. The configuration is still required for these services.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n\r\n`druid.export.storage.<google/s3>.tempLocalDir` and `druid.msq.intermediate.storage.tempDir` are no longer required configurations. If not configured, the task defaults to using the task temp directory.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a bug introduced in #16946, which incorrectly can cause SQL types which cannot be mapped to native druid types to be converted to null literals of the casted type.\r\n\r\nThis was discovered by testing using `ARRAY[NULL, NULL]`, which appears as `NULL ARRAY` for the SQL type, but `Calcites.getColumnTypeForRelDataType` did not have a case to handle this, so the method returned null. So using the added test as an example, the expression `arrayLongNulls = ARRAY[NULL, NULL]` was incorrectly converted to `arrayLongNulls = null` by this cast operator conversion logic, which is not correct.\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed by adding an extra check to ensure that `fromType` is `SqlTypeFamily.NULL` before making a null literal of toType.\r\n\r\nI've also modified `Calcites.getColumnTypeForRelDataType` to handle `NULL ARRAY` as `ARRAY<LONG>` (since it is the most restrictive druid array type), as well as modified some of the type coercion functions in `ExpressionTypeConversion` to be more consistent with other places by using `leastRestrictiveType` when arrays are involved instead of requiring the exact same array type so we can correctly handle these (admittedly likely uncommon) array constants with all null elements.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-05T10:25:29Z","updated_at":"2024-09-07T00:07:35Z","closed_at":"2024-09-07T00:07:32Z","merged_at":"2024-09-07T00:07:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0f36c1b89bced172d60d9f2188f2e054b7f2072","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

This differs from the current implementation of durationThreshold which uses the duration in the user supplied query. There are some usability constraints with using durationThreshold from the user supplied query, especially when using SQL. For example, if a client does not explicitly specify both start and end timestamps then the duration is extremely large and will always exceed the configured durationThreshold. This is one example interval from a query that specifies no end timestamp:\r\n\"interval\":[\"2024-08-30T08:05:41.944Z/146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z\"]. This interval is generated from a query like SELECT * FROM table WHERE __time > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '15' HOUR. Using the time period of the actual segments scanned allows proper prioritization without explicitly having to specify start and end timestamps.

Description\r\n\r\n#16768 introduces new compaction APIs on the Overlord `/compact/status` and `/compact/progress`.\r\nBut the corresponding `OverlordClient` methods do not return an object compatible with the actual endpoints defined in `OverlordCompactionResource`.\r\n\r\nThis patch ensures that the objects are compatible.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Add `CompactionStatusResponse` and `CompactionProgressResponse`\r\n- Use these as the return type in `OverlordClient` methods and as the response entity in `OverlordCompactionResource`\r\n- Add `SupervisorCleanupModule` bound on the Coordinator to perform cleanup of supervisors. Without this module, Coordinator cannot deserialize compaction supervisors.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- Added some UTs\r\n- Local Druid cluster:\r\n  - verified that compaction status APIs are redirected correctly when running compaction supervisor\r\n  - verified that compaction supervisors are cleaned up successfully by the coordinator","created_at":"2024-09-04T18:03:15Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T17:52:05Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T17:52:01Z","merged_at":"2024-09-05T17:52:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba6f804f4844a6cecaee0fef27577af7828f928e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2717749995,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE3NzQ5OTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `delta` input source only supports reading from the latest snapshot of the given Delta Lake table. This is a known documented limitation.\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\n\r\nAdd support for reading Delta snapshot. By default, the Druid-Delta connector reads the latest snapshot of the Delta table in order to preserve compatibility. Users can specify a `snapshotVersion` to ingest change data events from Delta tables into Druid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the future, we can also add support for time-based snapshot reads. The Delta API to read time-based snapshots  is not clear currently.\r\n\r\n### Examples:\r\n\r\nA. To ingest snapshot version 3 of the Delta table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nREPLACE INTO \"snapshot_delta_table\" OVERWRITE ALL\r\nSELECT \r\n\"id\",\r\n\"map_info\"\r\nFROM TABLE(\r\n  EXTERN(\r\n    '{\r\n      \"type\": \"delta\",\r\n      \"tablePath\": \"/Users/abhishek/projects/snapshot-table\",\r\n      \"snapshotVersion\": 3\r\n    }',\r\n    '{\"type\":\"json\"}'\r\n  )\r\n) EXTEND (\"id\" BIGINT, \"map_info\" TYPE('COMPLEX<json>'))\r\nPARTITIONED BY ALL\r\n```\r\n\r\nB. To ingest a latest snapshot of the Delta table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nREPLACE INTO \"snapshot_delta_table\" OVERWRITE ALL\r\nSELECT \r\n\"id\",\r\n\"map_info\"\r\nFROM TABLE(\r\n  EXTERN(\r\n    '{\r\n      \"type\": \"delta\",\r\n      \"tablePath\": \"/Users/abhishek/projects/snapshot-table\",\r\n    }',\r\n    '{\"type\":\"json\"}'\r\n  )\r\n) EXTEND (\"id\" BIGINT, \"map_info\" TYPE('COMPLEX<json>'))\r\nPARTITIONED BY ALL\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nUsers can optionally specify a `snapshotVersion` in the `delta` input source payload to ingest versioned snapshots from a Delta Lake table.  By default, Druid ingests the latest snapshot of the Delta Lake table when `snapshotVersion` is not specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ArrayListRowsAndColumns`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

patch adds `TypeCastSelectors`, which is used when writing frames to perform two coercions:\r\n\r\n- When a numeric type is desired and the underlying type is non-numeric or unknown, the underlying selector is wrapped, `getObject` is called and the result is coerced using `ExprEval.ofType`. This differs from the prior behavior where the primitive methods like `getLong`, `getDouble`, etc, would be called directly. This fixes an issue where a column would be read as all-zeroes when its SQL type is numeric and its physical type is string, which can happen when evolving a column's type from string to number.\r\n\r\n-  When an array type is desired, the underlying selector is wrapped, `getObject` is called, and the result is coerced to `Object[]`. This coercion replaces some earlier logic from #15917.","created_at":"2024-09-03T19:31:05Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T06:28:02Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T00:20:00Z","merged_at":"2024-09-06T00:20:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"175636b28ffa296eae36eea57b6a46f358fca25b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jon-wei","id":8729063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjkwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8729063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei","html_url":"https://github.com/jon-wei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jon-wei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

issue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\n\r\nIn the metadata cache, unused segment could be marked for refresh leading to unnecessary metadata queries. \r\n\r\nOne such scenario is:\r\n* Compaction task generates new set of segments for an interval leading to existing segments being marked as unused.\r\n* Those segments are being unloaded from historical's.\r\n* MetadataCache receives segment removal callback from historical's and marks the datasource for refresh.\r\n* The segment and schema poll updates the schema cache with schema for used segments. \r\n* The refresh call doesn't find schema for some segments and marks them to be refreshed in the next cycle. \r\n* In the next refresh call metadata query is issued for unused segments. \r\n\r\nThis PR tries to place a check for unused segments before marking it for refresh. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

issue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\n\r\nCurrently, an alert is thrown while merging datasource schema with realtime segment schema when the datasource schema already has update columns from the delta schema. \r\n\r\nThis isn't an error condition since the datasource schema can have those columns from a different segment. \r\n\r\nOne scenario in which this can occur is when multiple replicas for a task is run. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or

Description\r\nIn the compaction config, a `range` type `partitionsSpec` supports setting one of `maxRowsPerSegment` and `targetRowsPerSegment`. When compaction is run with the native engine, while `maxRowsPerSegment = x` results in segments of size `x`, `targetRowsPerSegment = y` results in segments of size `1.5 * y`.\r\n\r\nMSQ only supports `rowsPerSegment = x` as part of its tuning config, the resulting segment size being approx. `x`  --  which is in line with `maxRowsPerSegment` behaviour in native compaction. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. use _effective_ `maxRowsPerSegment` to pass as `rowsPerSegment` parameter for MSQ\r\n2. persist `rowsPerSegment` as `maxRowsPerSegment` in `lastCompactionState` for MSQ\r\n3.  Use effective `maxRowsPerSegment`-based range spec in `CompactionStatus` check for both Native and MSQ.\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nFollow-up to finish what #16533 and #16849 started, moving everything completely away from `StorageAdapter`.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* `CursorHolderFactory` has been renamed to `CursorFactory` and moved off of `StorageAdapter`, instead fetched directly from the segment via `asCursorFactory`. The previous deprecated `CursorFactory` interface has been merged into `StorageAdapter`\r\n* `StorageAdapter` is no longer used by any engines or tests and has been marked as deprecated with default implementations of all methods that throw exceptions indicating the new methods to call instead\r\n* `StorageAdapter` methods not covered by `CursorFactory` (`CursorHolderFactory` prior to this change) have been moved into interfaces which are retrieved by `Segment.as`, the primary classes are the previously existing `Metadata`, as well as new interfaces `PhysicalSegmentInspector` and `TopNOptimizationInspector`\r\n* added `UnnestSegment` and `FilteredSegment` that extend `WrappedSegmentReference` since their `StorageAdapter` implementations were previously provided by `WrappedSegmentReference`\r\n* added `PhysicalSegmentInspector` which covers some of the previous `StorageAdapter` functionality which was primarily used for segment metadata queries and other metadata uses, and is implemented for `QueryableIndexSegment` and `IncrementalIndexSegment`\r\n* added `TopNOptimizationInspector` to cover the oddly specific `StorageAdapter.hasBuiltInFilters` implementation, which is implemented for `IncrementalIndexSegment`, `QueryableIndexSegment`, `HashJoinSegment`, `UnnestSegment`, and `FilteredSegment`\r\n* Updated all engines and tests to no longer use `StorageAdapter`, deleted all `StorageAdapter` implementations\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n_(for developers)_\r\n\r\nThe `StorageAdapter` interface, which is a 'public' api, has been made obsolete and is no longer implemented or used internally by Druid. Prior to Druid 31, `StorageAdapter` extended the `CursorFactory` interface, with methods `canVectorize`, `makeCursors`, and `makeVectorCursor`, but these methods have been moved onto `StorageAdapter` itself, and all methods on `StorageAdapter` provide default implementations which throw a Druid exception indicating their replacement. \r\n\r\n`CursorFactory` has been repurposed to be the main interface which query engines use for selecting values from Druid segments. The primary method of `CursorFactory` is `makeCursorHolder`, which accepts a new `CursorBuildSpec`, a new container type which wraps the information previously specified in the arguments of the old `CursorFactory` methods, and returns a new interface `CursorHolder` which defines no argument versions of `canVectorize`, `asCursor`, and `asVectorCursor`.\r\n\r\nAn important thing to notice with the new `CursorHolder` interface is that the method is called `asCursor` instead of `asCursors`. `CursorFactory.makeCursors` previously returned a `Sequence<Cursor>` corresponding to the query granularity buckets, with a separate `Cursor` per bucket. `CursorHolder.asCursor` instead returns a single `Cursor` (equivalent to using 'ALL' granularity with the previous methhod), and a new `CursorGranularizer` has been added for query engines to iterate over the cursor and divide into granularity buckets. This makes the non-vectorized engine behave the same way as the vectorized query engine (with its `VectorCursorGranularizer`), and simplifies a lot of stuff that has to read segments particularly if it does not care about bucketing the results into granularities.\r\n\r\n`CursorFactory` also contains generally useful information for query engines _prior to creating a `Cursor`_, such as the ability to get a basic `RowSignature` of the segment it was created from, as well as `ColumnCapabilities` of the base columns. This information is _also_ available via `ColumnSelectorFactory`/`VectorColumnSelectorFactory` after the `Cursor`/`VectorCursor` have been created, and should generally be preferred over the information retrieved from `CursorFactory` itself.\r\n\r\nThe other functionality previously provided by `StorageAdapter` was often-times segment specific, so this stuff has been repurposed into a much more flexible manner of declaration and is retrieved using `Segment.as`. Several interfaces define the types of information which can be retrieved via `Segment.as`:\r\n* `TimeBoundaryInspector` inspector for min/max timestamps, if supported by the segment.\r\n* `PhysicalSegmentInspector` inspector for physical aspects of a segment useful for segment metadata queries, such as column value cardinality, min/max values, number of rows, and `Metadata` which contains information about how a physical segment was created during ingestion, such as aggregators used, timestamp spec, granularity, ordering\r\n* `MaxIngestedEventTimeInspector` inspector for realtime segments to get the highest available timestamp of rows processed so far\r\n\r\nInstead of all segment types being forced to provide this information even when it is impossible or nonsensical, this new model allows us to selectively provide this information as appropriate.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #8680 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Change Inspection Profile to set \"Method is identical to its super method\" as error\r\n\r\n#### Remove occurrences of \"Method is identical to its super method\"\r\n- There is an option to change to use `super().method` instead, do also let me know if using `super()` is preferred over deleting the methods whole.\r\n- Understand that every file under `extensions-core/` and `extensions-contrib/` are external dependencies. I did not remove the occurrences of \"Method is identical to its super method\" there. Do let me know if it is ok to remove also.\r\n\r\n#### Remove all unnecessary imports that resulted from the method removals\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

specifying extensions between extensions without having to explicitly install jars in multiple places.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently, in order to have extension A depend on extension B, you have to explicitly include extension B as a build dependency in extension A's pom.xml. This cause the jar for extension B to be included in extension A's directory and loaded as a module.\r\n\r\nThis can lead to some weird behavior e.g. the following bug linked from https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16929 caused by druid-kafka-extraction-namespace depending on druid-lookups-cached-global.\r\n```\r\nThere is logic in ExtensionsLoader.tryAdd that checks whether a module has already been loaded during initialization and skips it if it already has been loaded.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem when both druid-kafka-extraction-namespace and druid-lookups-cached-global are specified because they both load NamespaceExtractionModule.\r\n\r\nIf druid-kafka-extraction-namespace is specified first, both NamespaceExtractionModule and KafkaExtractionNamespaceModule are loaded by the druid-kafka-extraction-namespace classloader, and the druid-lookups-cached-global classloader doesn't load anything since NamespaceExtractionModule was already loaded. This is fine because the features of druid-lookups-cached-global are served through the module NamespaceExtractionModule being loaded in druid-kafka-extraction-namespace. (this is essentially the same behavior as just loading druid-kafka-extraction-namespace, and this is why loading both extensions in this order works)\r\n\r\nIf druid-lookups-cached-global is specified first, NamespaceExtractionModule is loaded by the druid-lookups-cached-global class loader. The druid-kafka-extraction-namespace classloader will only load KafkaExtractionNamespaceModule because NamespaceExtractionModule has already been loaded. This is a problem because kafka lookups rely on classes bound in NamespaceExtractionModule that it can't access (because NamespaceExtractionModule is only bound in the druid-lookups-cached-global classloader).\r\n```\r\n\r\nto get around this issue, my proposed fix is to allow chaining classloaders without having to actually copy jars. e.g. extension A won't actually have extension B's jar (we include the dependency as provided in the pom.xml). when extension A is loading classes, it will try to use extension B's classloader to find classes it can't find.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n**Classloaders**\r\nWe currently support two kinds of classloaders for each extension (extension-first or not). hadoop always uses the non extension-first classloader and other druid services check the druid.extensions.useExtensionClassloaderFirst property. \r\n\r\nI made a assumption to simplify the change in addAllFromFileSystem() (the code in ExtensionsLoader where chained classloaders are set up). in this code we always use the classloader based off of druid.extensions.useExtensionClassloaderFirst, so if druid.extensions.useExtensionClassloaderFirst=true, the StandardClassLoader objects won't get chained classloading setup.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this could be a issue with this line in HadoopTask (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/common/task/HadoopTask.java#L158), because if druid.extensions.useExtensionClassloaderFirst=true is set, only the ExtensionFirstClassLoaders will have chained classloading setup, but it seems like all HadoopTask does is combine all the resource urls from all the extensions so I don't think this is a issue. plus this is the current behavior.\r\n\r\nthis made it a little more annoying to implement chained classloading (see ExtensionLoader), but I didn't think we could deprecate this behavior so I left it in. I had to add a StandardClassLoader class because we were just using a regular UrlClassLoader object for the non extension-first classloader. In both StandardClassLoader and ExtensionFirstClassLoader i added the logic to check other extension's classloaders for classes. this is the part of the code i'd like some more detailed feedback on.\r\n\r\n**Extension dependency specification**\r\nI added a extension-dependencies.json per-extension resources file to specify inter-extension dependencies (see extensions-core/kafka-extraction-namespace/src/main/resources/extension-dependencies.json for a example)\r\n\r\nWhen loading extensions, ExtensionsLoader looks for a druid-* jar (the main extension code), and inspects it for a extension-dependencies.json resource file. If this file exists, it injects the correct chained classloaders to the extension classloader.\r\n\r\nI tested this with druid-kafka-extraction-namespace and druid-lookups-cached-global and everything seems to work okay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't added any unit tests yet because I want to get feedback on whether this approach seems reasonable.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- support explicit extension dependencies in druid\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ExtensionLoader`\r\n * `ExtensionFirstClassLoader`\r\n * `StandardClassLoader`\r\n * `PullDependencies`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

specifying extensions between extensions without having to explicitly install jars in multiple places.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently, in order to have extension A depend on extension B, you have to explicitly include extension B as a build dependency in extension A's pom.xml. This cause the jar for extension B to be included in extension A's directory and loaded as a module.\r\n\r\nThis can lead to some weird behavior e.g. the following bug linked from https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16929 caused by druid-kafka-extraction-namespace depending on druid-lookups-cached-global.\r\n```\r\nThere is logic in ExtensionsLoader.tryAdd that checks whether a module has already been loaded during initialization and skips it if it already has been loaded.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem when both druid-kafka-extraction-namespace and druid-lookups-cached-global are specified because they both load NamespaceExtractionModule.\r\n\r\nIf druid-kafka-extraction-namespace is specified first, both NamespaceExtractionModule and KafkaExtractionNamespaceModule are loaded by the druid-kafka-extraction-namespace classloader, and the druid-lookups-cached-global classloader doesn't load anything since NamespaceExtractionModule was already loaded. This is fine because the features of druid-lookups-cached-global are served through the module NamespaceExtractionModule being loaded in druid-kafka-extraction-namespace. (this is essentially the same behavior as just loading druid-kafka-extraction-namespace, and this is why loading both extensions in this order works)\r\n\r\nIf druid-lookups-cached-global is specified first, NamespaceExtractionModule is loaded by the druid-lookups-cached-global class loader. The druid-kafka-extraction-namespace classloader will only load KafkaExtractionNamespaceModule because NamespaceExtractionModule has already been loaded. This is a problem because kafka lookups rely on classes bound in NamespaceExtractionModule that it can't access (because NamespaceExtractionModule is only bound in the druid-lookups-cached-global classloader).\r\n```\r\n\r\nto get around this issue, my proposed fix is to allow chaining classloaders without having to actually copy jars. e.g. extension A won't actually have extension B's jar (we include the dependency as provided in the pom.xml). when extension A is loading classes, it will try to use extension B's classloader to find classes it can't find.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n\r\nWe currently support two kinds of classloaders for each extension (extension-first or not). hadoop always uses the non extension-first classloader and other druid services check the druid.extensions.useExtensionClassloaderFirst property. this made it a little more annoying to implement chained classloading (see ExtensionLoader), but I didn't think we could deprecate this behavior so I left it in. I had to add a StandardClassLoader class because we were just using a regular UrlClassLoader object for the non extension-first classloader. In both StandardClassLoader and ExtensionFirstClassLoader i added the logic to check other extension's classloaders for classes. this is the part of the code i'd like some more detailed feedback on.\r\n\r\nI added a root level extension-dependencies.json file to specify inter-extension dependencies. the kafka/global cached lookup dependency is included here. When building druid bundles, maven copies this file into the extensions/ directory so the PullDependencies command can read it. I was hoping to just have the PullDependencies command to copy the json over instead but the Main command that runs PullDependencies actually needs extensions to be loaded (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/services/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/cli/Main.java#L98), so this doesn't work.\r\nSince PullDependencies can delete the extensions/ directory before copying jars in, I had to update the logic to replace the extension-dependencies.json file after the extensions/ directory has been repopulated.\r\n\r\nThe logic to actually set dependencies from extension-dependencies.json in extension classloaders is in ExtensionsLoader.\r\n\r\nI tested this with druid-kafka-extraction-namespace and druid-lookups-cached-global and everything seems to work okay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't added any unit tests yet because I want to get feedback on whether this approach seems reasonable.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- support explicit extension dependencies in druid\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ExtensionLoader`\r\n * `ExtensionFirstClassLoader`\r\n * `StandardClassLoader`\r\n * `PullDependencies`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #16962 .\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * Remove searching everytime keystroke is detected.\r\n * Search 1 second after you finished typing, or after pressing Enter / return .\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR allows the `druid.azure.account` property to be nullable.\r\n\r\n`AzureStorageAccountInputSource` uses an injected `AzureAccountConfig` (used for configuring Azure deep storage) as a fallback configuration if the explicit input source configuration is not set.\r\n\r\nThe non-nullable annotation on `account` causes problems when using `AzureStorageAccountInputSource` in a Druid cluster that does not use Azure deep storage and does not have that property set. \r\n\r\nThe user should not have to set this property in that case.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\n\r\nCoordinator logs are fairly noisy and don't give much useful information (see example below).\r\nEven when the Coordinator misbehaves, these logs are not very useful.\r\n\r\n### Main changes\r\n\r\n- Add API `GET /druid/coordinator/v1/duties` that returns a status list of all duty groups currently running on the Coordinator\r\n- Emit metrics `segment/poll/time`, `segment/pollWithSchema/time`, `segment/buildSnapshot/time`\r\n- Remove redundant logs that indicate normal operation of well-tested aspects of the Coordinator\r\n\r\n### Refactors\r\n\r\n- Move some logic from `DutiesRunnable` to `CoordinatorDutyGroup`\r\n- Move stats collection from `CollectSegmentAndServerStats` to `PrepareBalancerAndLoadQueues`\r\n- Minor cleanup of class `DruidCoordinator`\r\n- Clean up class `DruidCoordinatorRuntimeParams`\r\n  - Remove field `coordinatorStartTime`. Maintain start time in `MarkOvershadowedSegmentsAsUnused` instead.\r\n  - Remove field `MetadataRuleManager`. Pass supplier to constructor of applicable duties instead.\r\n  - Make `usedSegmentsNewestFirst` and `datasourcesSnapshot` as non-nullable as they are always required.\r\n\r\n\r\n### API details\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>\r\n    <b>GET /druid/coordinator/v1/duties</b>\r\n  </summary>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"dutyGroups\": [\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"HistoricalManagementDuties\",\r\n        \"period\": \"PT0.100S\",\r\n        \"dutyNames\": [\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.PrepareBalancerAndLoadQueues\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.RunRules\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.DruidCoordinator$UpdateReplicationStatus\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.DruidCoordinator$CollectSegmentStats\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.UnloadUnusedSegments\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.MarkOvershadowedSegmentsAsUnused\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.MarkEternityTombstonesAsUnused\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.BalanceSegments\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.DruidCoordinator$CollectLoadQueueStats\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"lastRunStart\": \"2024-08-25T14:20:30.976Z\",\r\n        \"lastRunEnd\": \"2024-08-25T14:20:30.976Z\",\r\n        \"avgRuntimeMillis\": 10,\r\n        \"avgRunGapMillis\": 500\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"IndexingServiceDuties\",\r\n        \"period\": \"PT1800S\",\r\n        \"dutyNames\": [\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.KillStalePendingSegments\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.CompactSegments\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"lastRunStart\": \"2024-08-25T14:20:30.976Z\",\r\n        \"lastRunEnd\": \"2024-08-25T14:20:30.976Z\",\r\n        \"avgRuntimeMillis\": 100,\r\n        \"avgRunGapMillis\": 1000\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"MetadataStoreManagementDuties\",\r\n        \"period\": \"PT3600S\",\r\n        \"dutyNames\": [\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.KillSupervisors\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.KillAuditLog\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.KillRules\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.KillDatasourceMetadata\",\r\n            \"org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.KillCompactionConfig\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"lastRunStart\": \"2024-08-25T14:20:30.976Z\",\r\n        \"lastRunEnd\": \"2024-08-25T14:20:32.976Z\",\r\n        \"avgRuntimeMillis\": 0,\r\n        \"avgRunGapMillis\": 0\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><b>Coordinator become leader logs after this patch</b></summary>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```java\r\n2024-09-02T09:17:36,447 INFO [LeaderSelector[/druid/coordinator/_COORDINATOR]] org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.DruidCoordinator - I am the leader of the coordinators, all must bow!

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #16945\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Add interval check functionality\r\n- System will throw IAE if check is enabled, and the user-defined rules are violated.\r\n- Default: Time check functionality set to false. (Do not want systems to break all of a sudden if they actually want years like \"20240\").\r\n- Can enable functionality, and set start and end time with JSON input: `safeInput` (boolean), `safeStart` (string), `safeEnd` (string) respectively.\r\n- Documented changes in `ingestion-spec.md`.\r\n- Update `equals` and `hashcode` function, adhering to rule that objects that are equal must have the same hashcode.\r\n\r\n#### Unit test changes\r\n- Renamed test class allows easy navigation between to and from implementation classes with (Cmd Shift T) in IntelliJ.\r\n- Added unit tests for new functionalities.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nAdd functionality to check your ingestion intervals, giving early reporting to erroneous time intervals during ingestion.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, MSQ WF drill test suite uses maxNumTasks: 2 (default).\r\n\r\nThis means we can't detect any issues/regressions via this test, when we use multiple workers.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the MSQ WF drill test suite to use maxNumTasks: 5.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some test cases which can give different correct results across different runs due to MixShuffleSpec being present in the previous stage. Such test cases have been overridden to use a single worker. This has been done for 8 tests.\r\n\r\nSome tests have been modified to give deterministic result, while ensuring that the test is still validating what it was originally added for.\r\n\r\nI've ran `MSQDrillWindowQueryTest` 20+ times locally to ensure no flakiness for any other test that's not overridden to use a single worker.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

streaming supervisors will handle the case where the # of task groups is greater than the # of partitions available by truncating the # of task groups to the # of partitions (see KafkaSupervisor.getTaskGroupIdForPartition).

This seemed like the best place to do this.\r\n\r\nThe other place i considered was in generateReport, but thats only called when the supervisor /status endpoint is called or if debug logging is enabled.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- add a informational log when task groups > partition count.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

is currently a bug when upgrading from previous versions when running MSQ queries with durable storage.\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16790, the worker was changed to use the stage ID when writing files from durable storage. However, when reading files, the controller ID is still used (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/5d1950d4512ff464975773d8c3eead44bd6b8930/extensions-core/multi-stage-query/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/msq/shuffle/input/DurableStorageInputChannelFactory.java#L90)\r\n\r\nGenerally, this is not a problem, since these are the same since https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16168. However, when upgrading from previous versions, there is a bug where the stage id would be different. This causes tasks to fail with an exception \r\n```\r\norg.apache.druid.java.util.common.IOE: Encountered error while reading the output of stage [0], partition [0] for worker [0]\r\n```\r\nThis fixes the bug during upgrades by using the controller task id to write results to durable storage as well.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

inconsistency in `IPV4_PARSE` function SQL return type, which prior to this PR was specified as `INTEGER` while the native layer uses `LONG`. Because of this, something like `ipv4_parse('192.168.0.1')` would return -1062731775 since java only has signed integers, while the long number of the native layer is 3232235521.\r\n\r\nWe could probably consider casting the negative arguments in the native layer into an int and then the bits back into a long to try to turn something like -1062731775 into 3232235521 so it isn't discarded as a null, but I didn't make that change at this time since there would be some performance cost to it, and I'm not sure if it should work

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently compaction with MSQ engine doesn't work for rollup on multi-value dimensions (MVDs), the reason being the default behaviour of grouping on MVD dimensions to unnest the dimension values; for instance grouping on `[s1,s2]` with aggregate `a` will result in two rows: `<s1,a>` and `<s2,a>`. \r\n\r\nThis change enables rollup on MVDs (without unnest) by converting MVDs to Arrays before rollup using virtual columns, and then converting them back to MVDs using post aggregators. If segment schema is available to the compaction task (when it ends up downloading segments to get existing dimensions/metrics/granularity), it selectively does the MVD-Array conversion only for known multi-valued columns; else it conservatively performs this conversion for all `string` columns.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MSQCompactionRunner`\r\n * `CompactionTask`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16907#issuecomment-2300001101. I hope this should work because increasing the timeout on the sequence gives a longer period to initialize all of the sequences which have been started by making a yielder in the loop. \r\n\r\nThe test wants a timeout to happen, but if the timeout happens during this initialization loop then it is before we are expecting the timeout to happen so instead of passing it fails because the timeout is too soon. We retain the sleep because if the initialization happens really fast we do want to wait long enough for the timeout to

not necessary to load both druid-lookups-cached-global and druid-kafka-extraction-namespace to use kafka lookups. In fact if you happen to load both in the wrong order (global lookups before kafka lookups), it actually breaks kafka lookups (see: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/3538).\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\nthe druid-kafka-extraction-namespace extension has a dependency on druid-lookups-cached-global, so when loading the extension, both modules (<KafkaExtractionNamespaceModule> and <NamespaceExtractionModule>) are included.\r\n\r\nSo when druid-kafka-extraction-namespace is included as a extension, both modules are loaded and the features for both extensions are loaded (kafka lookups and global cached lookups)\r\n\r\nThere is logic in ExtensionsLoader.tryAdd that checks whether a module has already been loaded during initialization and skips it if it already has been loaded.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem when both druid-kafka-extraction-namespace and druid-lookups-cached-global are specified because they both load NamespaceExtractionModule.\r\n\r\nIf druid-kafka-extraction-namespace is specified first, both NamespaceExtractionModule and KafkaExtractionNamespaceModule are loaded by the druid-kafka-extraction-namespace classloader, and the druid-lookups-cached-global classloader doesn't load anything since NamespaceExtractionModule was already loaded. This is fine because the features of druid-lookups-cached-global are served through the module NamespaceExtractionModule being loaded in druid-kafka-extraction-namespace. (this is essentially the same behavior as just loading druid-kafka-extraction-namespace, and this is why loading both extensions in this order works)\r\n\r\nIf druid-lookups-cached-global is specified first, NamespaceExtractionModule is loaded by the druid-lookups-cached-global class loader. The druid-kafka-extraction-namespace classloader will only load KafkaExtractionNamespaceModule because NamespaceExtractionModule has already been loaded. This is a problem because kafka lookups rely on classes bound in NamespaceExtractionModule that it can't access (because NamespaceExtractionModule is only bound in the druid-lookups-cached-global classloader). this is the cause of the linked bug\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIMO the current behavior is a little weird (loading one extension essentially loads two extensions), but to fix this we would have to either move the shared code into druid core or allow first class extension dependencies. For now i think it makes sense to update the documentation to specify that you should only ever load one of the two extensions.\r\n\r\nI have tested this behavior in a druid cluster (loading just the kafka extension and trying to create both a kafka lookup and a cachedNamespace lookup)\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nUpdate documentation for enabling kafka and globally cached lookups\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * docs/querying/kafka-extraction-namespace.md\r\n * docs/querying/lookups-cached-global.md\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFollow-up to #16533, `Query.isDescending()` can only be set by `TimeseriesQuery`, everything else hard-coded this parameter to the value `false`, and it is only used by `TimeseriesQuery` to control the direction of time ordering in results.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n(for developers)\r\n\r\n`Query.isDescending` has been moved from the base `Query` interface to `TimeseriesQuery` since it was the only built-in query type which could set or use this parameter. If you have developed a custom query type or query engine extension that utilized this method on the `Query` interface, it will need to be moved to the custom query type, replaced with false if referencing any built-in query type that is not timeseries, or handle the query as a `TimeseriesQuery` directly if it is referencing a timeseries query.","created_at":"2024-08-17T02:53:51Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T06:31:05Z","closed_at":"2024-08-20T06:02:45Z","merged_at":"2024-08-20T06:02:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"518f642028654befbaa09c328b7ccaf30ffd6f63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release
