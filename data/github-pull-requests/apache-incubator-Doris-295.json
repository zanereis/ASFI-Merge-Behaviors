Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: Step1.3 of [DSIP-023: Add inverted index for full text search](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DORIS/DSIP-023%3A+Add+inverted+index+for+full+text+search?src=contextnavpagetreemode)\r\nrelated pr: https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/13430, https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/14207\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\nIntroduce a fulltext query syntax with keyword `MATCH`, `MATCH_ANY`, `MATCH_ALL`.\r\n- `MATCH_ANY` means hit one of multiple terms, will return true\r\n- `MATCH_ALL` means must hit all of  multiple terms, will return true\r\n- `MATCH` is equivalent to `MATCH_ ANY`\r\n\r\nmatch syntax check list:\r\n- string type inverted index column,  \r\n- and inverted index set `STANDARD` or `ENGLISH` parser, default no tokenizer if not set parser type\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n```\r\n-- create table with INVERTED index \r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE httplogs (\r\n  ts datetime,\r\n  clientip varchar(20),\r\n  request string,\r\n  status smallint,\r\n  size int,\r\n  INDEX idx_size (size) USING INVERTED,\r\n  INDEX idx_clientip (clientip) USING INVERTED,\r\n  INDEX idx_request (request) USING INVERTED PROPERTIES(\"parser\"=\"standard\")\r\n)\r\nDUPLICATE KEY(ts)\r\nDISTRIBUTED BY RANDOM BUCKETS 10;\r\n\r\n-- fulltext search\r\n- check ok: \r\nselect * from httplogs where request match_any 'GET'; \r\nselect * from httplogs where request match 'GET'; \r\nselect * from httplogs where request match_any 'GET images'; \r\nselect * from httplogs where request match_all 'GET images'; \r\n\r\n- check failed:\r\nselect * from httplogs where clientip match_any '127';  // clientip no tokenizer\r\nselect * from httplogs where status match_any '10'; // status no inverted index\r\nselect * from httplogs where size match_any '10';  // size is numeric type\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5.

freemandealer <freeman.zhang1992@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n# Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #14174\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nCheck will fail because _segid_statistics_map.find(_num_segcompacted) == _segid_statistics_map.end().\r\nHere the check is ensuring _segid_statistics_map has no existing entry indexed by _num_segcompacted.\r\n\r\nWhen will _segid_statistics_map add an entry? The answer is:\r\n1) after a segment is flushed, or\r\n2) after segcompacting, or\r\n3) after renaming the big segments which need not segcompact.\r\n\r\nWe note a segment that has never been played by segcompaction as 'raw_seg'. When these raw segments are compacted, their records will be erased from _segid_statistics_map and 'new_seg' (compacted results) will be added to the map as a replacement.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nFor 7 raw segments 'oooOOoo' ('O' for the big segment while 'o' for the small), we break it into four parts: 1) ooo ,  2)O,  3)O,  4)oo.\r\nGroup 1 will be compacted to form 'new_seg_1-3', and raw_seg_1, raw_seg_2, raw_seg_3 are wiped out.\r\nGroup 2 will be renamed from 'raw_seg_4' to 'new_seg_2' and add it to the map.\r\nGroup 3 will be renamed from 'raw_seg_5' to 'new_seg_3' and add it to the map.\r\nGroup 4 will be compacted to form 'new_seg_6-7', and raw_seg_6, raw_seg_7 are wiped out.\r\nFinally, we rename 'new_seg_1-3' to 'new_seg_1' and 'new_seg_6-7' to 'new_seg_4'. So we end up having new_seg_1, new_seg_2, new_seg_3, and new_seg_4.\r\n\r\nBut for those who start with one or more big segments, the problem happens.\r\nTake 'OOoooo' as an example. We break them into 3 groups: 1) O, 2) O, 3) oooo.\r\nGroup 1 will be renamed from 'raw_seg_1' to 'new_seg_1' and add it to the map. Coz it is the first segment that is big, filenames get lined up -- src filename & dst filename are the same (ignore the raw/new sign that are only used to distinguish in this comment).\r\n\r\nThe case should be carefully handled. We do not need to actually rename it but we should count it as handled. If we miss counting (increase _num_segcompacted), the following group 2 will still want to be renamed as 'new_seg_1', but 'new_seg_1' is already in the map, causing the check to fail at last.\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n~~Issue Number: close #xxx~~\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, it takes too much time to build BE from source in workflow environments (P0/P1) which affects the efficiency of daily development.\r\n\r\nWe can measure the time by executing the following command.\r\n```shell\r\ntime EXTRA_CXX_FLAGS='-O3' BUILD_TYPE=ASAN ./build.sh --be --fe --clean -j \"$(nproc)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes the compilation time by exploiting the following methods.\r\n1. Reduce the codegen by removing some useless `std::visit`.\r\n2. Disable the optimization for some template functions which are instantiated by `std::visit` conditionally (except for the **RELEASE** build).\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n3. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-10T09:57:37Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T04:10:44Z","closed_at":"2022-11-11T04:09:55Z","merged_at":"2022-11-11T04:09:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"118a7dff073c5733541d1cbca55024aaefbdedca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nAdded a macro `RETURN_IF_CATCH_BAD_ALLOC` to catch `bad alloc` and return `Status::MemoryLimitExceeded`. Large memory allocations should use this macro in the future.\r\n\r\nFor tcmalloc, the returned `Status::MemoryLimitExceeded` has only bad alloc errors.\r\n\r\nFor jemalloc, the returned `Status::MemoryLimitExceeded` additionally contains mem tracker statistics, and because the mem limit is checked before the actual memory application, it can effectively avoid OOM.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. Two Caches\r\n\t1. HiveMetaStoreCache: mainly used to cache table partition and file information\r\n\t2. ExternalSchemaCache: mainly used to cache the schema information of the table.\r\n\r\n\t\tExternalSchemaCache works for all tables in ExternalCatalog, while HiveMetaStoreCache works only for tables in HMSExternalCatalog.\r\n\t\t\r\n2. ExternalMetaCacheMgr\r\n\r\n\tCache management class, responsible for managing the mapping relationship between Catalog and HiveMetaStoreCache and ExternalSchemaCache.\r\n\t\r\n3. Cache strategy\r\n\r\n\t1. ExternalSchemaCache\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBoth Database and Table in ExternalCatalog are persisted to Doris metadata. However, the schema information of the Table is not persisted, but is obtained directly from the ExternalSchemaCache. If it does not exist in the cache, it will access the HMS to get it and cache it.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe cache uses Guava's LoadingCache class. The schema of up to 10,000 tables is cached by default, which can be modified through the FE configuration item max_external_schema_cache_num .\r\n  \r\n  \t\tEach FE caches its own required schema independently.\r\n\r\n\t2. HiveMetaStoreCache\r\n\r\n\t\tThree types of information are cached:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t1. partitionValuesCache\r\n\r\n\t\t\tCache table to all information with partition value. This information is mainly used for partition pruning.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n    \t\tWhen a table is accessed, Doris will obtain all the partition values ​​(Partition values) information of the table in full, and convert it into a ListPartitionItem object inside Doris and store it in the cache.\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tThe ListPartitionItem object can construct a RangeMap for partition clipping. After cropping, a set of partition IDs can be obtained.\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tThe default cache is 10W, which can be adjusted by max_hive_partition_cache_num\r\n\r\n\t\t2. partitionCache\r\n    \r\n    \t\tPartition cache, the key is <table-partition_values>, and the value is the partition information, including the inputformat, location and other information of the partition. After the partition is cut, we can obtain a set of partitionCache keys through the partition ID, and then obtain the partition.\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tThe default cache is 10W, which can be adjusted by max_hive_partition_cache_num\r\n    \t\r\n    \t3. fileCache\r\n    \r\n    \t\tFile cache, the key is the location, and the value is the information of all files under the location. We can use the location of the partition as the key of the fileCache, and finally get all the file information.\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tThe default cache is 10W, which can be adjusted by max_external_file_cache_num\r\n\r\n4. Cache optimization\r\n\r\n\tAfter partition pruning, a set of partitions is obtained. We need to traverse these partitions and get the partition information from the partitionCache in turn. When the cache misses, the HMS will be accessed to obtain partition information. If there are many partitions, a large number of RPCs will be generated. In the actual test, it is found that it takes more than 5 minutes to obtain 1W partition information with a single thread.\r\n\t\r\n\tHere we use java's parallelStream to acquire partition concurrently, and the time-consuming can be reduced to 1 minute.\r\n\t\r\n\tAt the same time, we set the number of background threads of loadingCache to 10, and this thread pool is shared by all caches.\r\n\t\r\n5. Why not get partitions in batch from HMS?\r\n\r\n\tBecause partitionCache is partition-based, not table-based. Batch acquisition can only take the table as the granularity, and each cache entry caches all partition information of a table. In this way, the purpose of \"on-demand caching\" is achieved, and partition cutting cannot be performed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nBefore this pr, if we try to load ORC file with native list(or array) type data, the be will crash.\r\n\r\nBecause complex types in ORC file include multi real columns, so we need to filter columns by column names.\r\nOtherwise we could not read all columns we need.\r\n\r\nNow arrow release-7.0.0 only support create stripe reader by column index, so we patch it to support create stripe reader by column names.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-09T15:39:04Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T09:48:18Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T09:48:17Z","merged_at":"2022-11-15T09:48:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ea9d3f2e1d159285d0e1d09dfe232f3c6c90573","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1817282214,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODE3MjgyMjE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/test","name":"kind/test","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen upgrade from 1.1 to master, and then rollback to 1.1, and upgrade to master again, BE will coredump because some rowsets has schema and some rowsets has no schema. In the first time upgrade from 1.1, BE will flush schema in all rowsets and after rollback to 1.1, BE do compaction, and create some new rowset without schema. And the second time upgrade from 1.1, BE coredump because some conditions depend on having all or none of the rowsets. \r\n\r\nFix: add a tablet_meta field to distinguish whether  light schema change table or not. It will let the not light schema change table ignore some conditions which lead to crash in upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

load_channel_mgr.cpp:188] erase timeout load channel: bfc1f85bd4d743db-8804da3331d2cc84\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nWhen the data transmission of a node channel fails, then the node channel is marked as cancel. The subsequent add batch skips the node. \r\nThe normal node channel sends the last data with an EOS flag. The destination will process the EOS flag and actively erase the corresponding load channel.\r\nHowever, the cancelled node channel will not send EOS, nor actively send a cancel request to the destination, so the destination load channel will not be released.\r\n\r\n### How\r\nWhen closing, the failed node channel initiates a cancel operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #14099\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThe current audit log plugin periodically imports FE audit logs to specified Doris cluster for users to view and analyze audit logs using SQL. In most cases, users pay more attention to the slow query of audit logs. Based on the current audit log plugin, this PR imports the audit logs corresponding to slow query into specified table, facilitating users to query and analysis the audit logs through SQL.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.
