fixes ISSUE-#852 by starting gunicorn with a pid file and to exit immediately after that. This makes airflow's webserver behave more standard. To retain old behavior you can specify \"-f\" or \"--foreground\". \n- the pid file is placed in AIRFLOW_HOME/airflow-webserver.pid or if you are running systemd in /run/airflow/webserver.pid. If you want to store it somewhere else please use \"--pid\" as an argument.\n- systemd profile for the webserver is now a bit more secure \n- if you are running systemd make sure to follow the

Overview\n\nThis PR adds an end-to-end dag tester to Airflow, located in `tests_dags/dag_tester.py`, as well as some DAG tests located in `tests_dags/tests/bash_operator_dag_tests.py`\n\nThese tests require a connection to a concurrent db (i.e. not SQLite) in the `sql_alchemy_conn` field of your `unittests.cfg`. The tests will be skipped otherwise.\n### How to use\n- The test author creates one or several DAG files and store them in `tests_dags/dags`. \n- The test author provides one or several units test for the dag(s), (cf examples in `tests_dags/tests/bash_operator_dag_tests.py`). This test should provide: \n  - `get_dag_file_names` to specify which dag files are involved in this test\n  - `get_context` (optional): a dictionary of `Variable` to be provided to the DAG at test time\n  - if we want to test the dags with a `BackfillJob`, inherit from `EndToEndBackfillJobTest` and  implement `get_backfill_params` to specify the constructor parameters of `BackfillJob`. \n  - if we want to test the dags with a `SchedulerJob`, inherit from `EndToEndSchedulerJobTest` and  implement `get_schedulerjob_params` to specify the constructor parameters of `SchedulerJob`\n  - implement `post_check` with a set of post-execution validation steps \n- The DAG created by the test author may access the name of their runtime temporary folder with `Variable.get(\"unit_test_tmp_dir\")` as well as any other context parameter provided by the test. For example, if the test implements this:\n  \n  ```\n  def get_context(self):\n      return {\"country\": \"India\",\n              \"product_sample_size\": 10000}\n  ```\n  \n  then the DAG will be able to access those values at test time via: \n  \n  ```\n  Variable.get(key=\"country\", deserialize_json=True)\n  Variable.get(key=\"product_sample_size\", deserialize_json=True)\n  ```\n- The design of the test should keep in mind that the executors are ultimately starting child processes via some `airflow run blah` commands. This is particularly important to design the interactions between the test initialization, its running, and the validation of post-conditions, since they do not all run within the same python process. \n### How it works\n\nThe DAG Tester will:\n- create a temporary folder for each test and copy all the tested DAGs in a subfolder `dags` of that folder\n- copy an airflow configuration file to that temporary folder, adapts its `dags_folder` value according to the above. \n- write in `Variables` the location of the temporary folder in `unit_test_tmp_dir` as well as all the values provided by the test in `get_context`. (If any `Variables` would have been overwritten in the process, their values are saved and restored during `cleanup`)\n- depending on what is implemented by the test, build a `BackfillJob` and/or a `SchedulerJob` with the tested dags and run it\n- after each run, execute the test `post_check`\n### Future possible improvements\n- we currently only run the test with a `BackfillJob` with a `SequencialExecutor` and/or with a `SchedulerJob` with a `LocalExcecutor`. We could add more executors and combinations\n- each test is executed with its own config file, though it's almost the same for every test => we could extend the framework to validate different kinds of configurations per test\n- all tests provided so far are validating the `BashOperator`, though adding more kinds of operator should be straightforward. \n- we could extend it to run the job several times, maybe thus allowing to validate restartability of a DAG (e.g. a whole DAG that fails twice before succeeding), idempotency (a DAG that is executed several times with the same `execution_date`, with a `clear` between each run, should not produce corrupted output) or simulating addition/removal/update of DAG files between successive executions.\n- we could try to extend to execution of several jobs in parallel, thus improving the validation of race condition (although test of parallel code is always tricky) \n### Limitations\n- The `num_runs` parameter for `SchedulerJob` tests is artificially high in some cases, we do not always understand why more `DagRun`s than the theoretical number are needed. This has an impact on the execution time.\n- The execution time of the 7 DAG tests with both kinds of executors over a period of up to 10 days requires about 20 minutes to execute on Travis => we might need to discuss when we want execute them.\n","created_at":"2015-12-10T18:42:33Z","updated_at":"2018-12-18T04:20:14Z","closed_at":"2018-12-18T04:20:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c6cb4841e289a7b1640b3a854e1a229bf6963c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Technologies that only allow passing credentials with a query could potentially pose a problem in this context when all the sql queries executed are shown in logs. Maybe this could be added back when airflow has a debug mode, but definitely a security risk.\n\nFor example, AWS redshift authenticates with aws credentials with their COPY command which looks like

purpose of this is to not expose the username and passwords in the configuration file on the production machine.\n\nIn case when configuration.get('core', SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN / BROKER_URL / CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND) is EMPTY, fallback to check the value of corresponding fallback key say SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_CMD. If the fallback value is valid then run bash command on it and return the result.\n\nRight now, only those 3 keys use the callback because they contain username and passwords. But this can be the general rule of thumb if needed.\n\nI can add tests for this if you'll be interested in this PR. @mistercrunch \n\nUPDATE: I've added tests and added an entry to the

PR removes the hack in the executors/**init**.py by only importing executors when specified to do so. It is assumed (in views.py) that a failure to import CeleryExecutor means it is not active anyway and thus a run() fails accordingly. Furthermore it adds logging to sections/keys that are non existent in a config so debugging config issues becomes easier.\n","created_at":"2015-11-20T19:51:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:41:13Z","closed_at":"2015-11-21T17:36:49Z","merged_at":"2015-11-21T17:36:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"8dd0717f41439e5398f3fc96f0cd365d303952ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/675/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/675/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/675/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6d996635cc6cb069d39685904163b6efb0878174","head":{"label":"bolkedebruin:better_logging","ref":"better_logging","sha":"6d996635cc6cb069d39685904163b6efb0878174","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38505714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUwNTcxNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"bolkedebruin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow","description":"AirFlow
