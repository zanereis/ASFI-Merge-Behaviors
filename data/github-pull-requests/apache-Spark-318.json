What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe failed test case is, we have a `SortMergeJoinExec` for a self-join, which means we have a `ReusedExchange` node in the query plan. It works fine without caching, but throws an exception in `SortMergeJoinExec.outputPartitioning` if we cache it.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is, `ReusedExchange` doesn't propagate the output partitioning from its child, so in `SortMergeJoinExec.outputPartitioning` we create `PartitioningCollection` with a hash partitioning and an unknown partitioning, and fail.\r\n\r\nThis bug is mostly fine, because inserting the `ReusedExchange` is the last step to prepare the physical plan, we won't call `SortMergeJoinExec.outputPartitioning` anymore after this.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the dataframe is cached, the physical plan of it becomes `InMemoryTableScanExec`, which contains another physical plan representing the cached query, and it has gone through the entire planning phase and may have `ReusedExchange`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTyped Min and Max functions are missing for aggregations done on dataset. These are supported for DataFrames and therefore should also be part of the DataSet API.\r\n\r\nPlease note that it is OK that the min and max functions start the MR job with MAX and MIN values respectively, because only retrieved keys are returned.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that it is likely that more functions will be added to the changed files. Hence  I started JIRA SPARK-20891 to address duplicate code that will otherwise occur.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded some corresponding unit tests.","created_at":"2017-05-25T21:12:22Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T13:11:02Z","closed_at":"2018-12-14T13:11:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4102cebc2f3a36d1b8a71ac6227123ca46cb3b77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18113/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18113/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18113/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ce6a7bfc9201e50ca10290e903e859890ef4fad4","head":{"label":"setjet:spark-20890","ref":"spark-20890","sha":"ce6a7bfc9201e50ca10290e903e859890ef4fad4","user":{"login":"setjet","id":1176161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzYxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1176161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet","html_url":"https://github.com/setjet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63481050,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzQ4MTA1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"setjet/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"setjet","id":1176161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzYxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1176161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet","html_url":"https://github.com/setjet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/setjet/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ConfigBuilder` builds `ConfigEntry` which can only read value with one key, if we wanna change the config name but still keep the old one, it's hard to do.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduce `ConfigBuilder.withAlternative`, to support reading config value with alternative keys. And also rename `spark.scheduler.listenerbus.eventqueue.size` to `spark.scheduler.listenerbus.eventqueue.capacity` with this feature, according to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14269#discussion_r118432313\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA bunch of changes to the StateStore APIs and implementation.\r\nCurrent state store API has a bunch of problems that causes too many transient objects causing memory pressure.\r\n\r\n- `StateStore.get(): Option` forces creation of Some/None objects for every get. Changed this to return the row or null.\r\n- `StateStore.iterator(): (UnsafeRow, UnsafeRow)` forces creation of new tuple for each record returned. Changed this to return a UnsafeRowTuple which can be reused across records.\r\n- `StateStore.updates()` requires the implementation to keep track of updates, while this is used minimally (only by Append mode in streaming aggregations). Removed updates() and updated StateStoreSaveExec accordingly.\r\n- `StateStore.filter(condition)` and `StateStore.remove(condition)` has been merge into a single API `getRange(start, end)` which allows a state store to do optimized range queries (i.e. avoid full scans). Stateful operators have been updated accordingly.\r\n- Removed a lot of unnecessary row copies Each operator copied rows before calling StateStore.put() even if the implementation does not require it to be copied. It is left up to the implementation on whether to copy the row or not.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\n- Added a name to the StateStoreId so that each operator+partition can use multiple state stores (different names)\r\n- Added a configuration that allows the user to specify which implementation to use. \r\n- Added new metrics to understand the time taken to update keys, remove keys and commit all changes to the state store. These metrics will be visible on the plan diagram in the SQL tab of the UI.\r\n- Refactored unit tests such that they can be reused to test any implementation of StateStore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nOld and new unit

reported cases in this issue, we fail to get to TID from TaskContext and that causes unable to release the lock and assertion failures. To resolve this, we have to explicitly pass the TID value to the `unlock` method.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new failing regression test case in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA one-liner change in `ShuffleExchange.nodeName` to cover the case when `coordinator` is `null`, so that the match expression is exhaustive.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to [SPARK-20872](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20872) for a description of the symptoms.\r\nTL;DR is that inspecting a `ShuffleExchange` (directly or transitively) on the Executor side can hit a case where the `coordinator` field of a `ShuffleExchange` is null, and thus will trigger a `MatchError` in `ShuffleExchange.nodeName()`'s inexhaustive match expression.\r\n\r\nAlso changed two other match conditions in `ShuffleExchange` on the `coordinator` field to be consistent.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested this change with a case where the `coordinator` is null to make sure `ShuffleExchange.nodeName` doesn't throw a `MatchError` any more.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-24T18:52:36Z","updated_at":"2017-05-25T00:22:22Z","closed_at":"2017-05-25T00:22:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d88f3cadb31f6226321626b8fc1c3d20175ebc09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18095/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18095/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18095/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a65ac4fe14f4bd274e62da58103ea8cbdb737c11","head":{"label":"rednaxelafx:shuffleexchange-nodename","ref":"shuffleexchange-nodename","sha":"a65ac4fe14f4bd274e62da58103ea8cbdb737c11","user":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89513466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTUxMzQ2Ng==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"rednaxelafx/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the shuffle service registration timeout and retry has been hardcoded. This works well for small workloads but under heavy workload when the shuffle service is busy transferring large amount of data we see significant delay in responding to the registration request, as a result we often see the executors fail to register with the shuffle service, eventually failing the job. We need to make these two parameters configurable.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Updated `BlockManagerSuite` to test registration timeout and max attempts configuration actually works.\r\n\r\ncc

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLong time ago we fixed a [bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-3948) in shuffle writer about `FileChannel.transferTo`. We were not very confident about that fix, so we added a position check after the writing, try to discover the bug earlier.\r\n\r\n However this checking is missing in the new `UnsafeShuffleWriter`, this PR adds it.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18105 maybe related to that `FileChannel.transferTo` bug, hopefully we can find out the root cause after adding this position check.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A","created_at":"2017-05-24T16:32:21Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T07:04:31Z","closed_at":"2017-05-26T07:04:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"74f5b4c9f3aa30bbd6051fac61515096a8b3f2ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18091/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18091/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18091/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c79de072fd4c0e32f5a62d15f8d921095d4e3bf0","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:shuffle","ref":"shuffle","sha":"c79de072fd4c0e32f5a62d15f8d921095d4e3bf0","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when a task is calling spill() but it receives a killing request from driver (e.g., speculative task), the `TaskMemoryManager` will throw an `OOM` exception.  And we don't catch `Fatal` exception when a error caused by `Thread.interrupt`. So for `ClosedByInterruptException`, we should throw `RuntimeException` instead of `OutOfMemoryError`.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20250?jql=project%20%3D%20SPARK\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-24T15:17:20Z","updated_at":"2017-05-29T07:26:57Z","closed_at":"2017-05-25T07:51:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f35d6f76890bf6fcde27b081a148b966a23fc16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18090/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18090/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18090/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a45ff5ced6cffd3d8ed41574df3bdd8e463bc21","head":{"label":"ConeyLiu:SPARK-20250","ref":"SPARK-20250","sha":"1a45ff5ced6cffd3d8ed41574df3bdd8e463bc21","user":{"login":"ConeyLiu","id":12733256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12733256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54686577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDY4NjU3Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ConeyLiu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ConeyLiu","id":12733256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzMzMjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12733256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ConeyLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ConeyLiu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds Coda Hale metrics for instrumenting the `LiveListenerBus` in order to track the number of events received, dropped, and processed. In addition, it adds per-SparkListener-subclass timers to track message processing time. This is useful for identifying when slow third-party SparkListeners cause performance bottlenecks. \r\n\r\nSee the new `LiveListenerBusMetrics` for a complete description of the new metrics.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests in SparkListenerSuite, including a test to ensure proper counting of dropped listener events.","created_at":"2017-05-24T01:39:58Z","updated_at":"2017-06-09T01:14:45Z","closed_at":"2017-06-09T01:11:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9eff521d12e3050906350b3a9174daed203bbfd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/76b669ca6eb35a0cce4291702baa5d1f60adb467","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:listener-bus-metrics","ref":"listener-bus-metrics","sha":"76b669ca6eb35a0cce4291702baa5d1f60adb467","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current implementation of weekofyear implements ISO8601, which results in the following unintuitive behaviour: \r\n\r\nweekofyear(\"2017-01-01\") returns 52 \r\n\r\nIn MySQL, this would return 1 (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_weekofyear), although it could return 52 if specified specifically (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_week).\r\n\r\nI therefore think instead of only changing the behavior as specified in the JIRA, it would be better to support both. Hence  I've added an additional function.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded some unit tests\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-24T00:28:27Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:56Z","closed_at":"2018-11-11T06:09:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"af43524209206f25371b7ab0505c81dae7c585df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c9b5d3c6af85b2d189bd9a81a1dcdf10f4b6f2e8","head":{"label":"setjet:SPARK-20771","ref":"SPARK-20771","sha":"c9b5d3c6af85b2d189bd9a81a1dcdf10f4b6f2e8","user":{"login":"setjet","id":1176161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzYxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1176161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet","html_url":"https://github.com/setjet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63481050,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzQ4MTA1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"setjet/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"setjet","id":1176161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzYxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1176161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet","html_url":"https://github.com/setjet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setjet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/setjet/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a TaskContext is not propagated properly to all child threads for the task, just like the reported cases in this issue, we fail to get to TID from TaskContext and that causes unable to release the lock and assertion failures. To resolve this, we have to explicitly pass the TID value to the `unlock` method.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new failing regression test case in `RDDSuite`.","created_at":"2017-05-23T23:23:58Z","updated_at":"2017-05-24T07:54:29Z","closed_at":"2017-05-24T07:46:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"befa7624f473562f2b63cd00c14548cdb6665a44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc66ec52adf0f741a0c533b28ca64e3fef9e848e","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:completion-iterator","ref":"completion-iterator","sha":"bc66ec52adf0f741a0c533b28ca64e3fef9e848e","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pull-request exclusively includes the class splitting feature described in #16648. When code for a given class would grow beyond 1600k bytes, a private, nested sub-class is generated into which subsequent functions are inlined. Additional sub-classes are generated as the code threshold is met subsequent times. This code includes 3 changes:\r\n\r\n1. Includes helper maps, lists, and functions for keeping track of sub-classes during code generation (included in the `CodeGenerator` class). These helper functions allow nested classes and split functions to be initialized/declared/inlined to the appropriate locations in the various projection classes.\r\n2. Changes `addNewFunction` to return a string to support instances where a split function is inlined to a nested class and not the outer class (and so must be invoked using the class-qualified name). Uses of `addNewFunction` throughout the codebase are modified so that the returned name is properly used.\r\n3. Removes instances of the `this` keyword when used on data inside generated classes. All state declared in the outer class is by default global and accessible to the nested classes. However, if a reference to global state in a nested class is prepended with the `this` keyword, it would attempt to reference state belonging to the nested class (which would not exist), rather than the correct variable belonging to the outer class.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test case to the `GeneratedProjectionSuite` that increases the number of columns tested in various projections to a threshold that would previously have triggered a `JaninoRuntimeException` for the Constant Pool. \r\n\r\nNote: This PR does not address the second Constant Pool issue with code generation (also mentioned in #16648): excess global mutable state. A second PR may be opened to resolve that issue.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR generates the following Java code\r\n1. Build each in-memory table cache using `ColumnarBatch` with `ColumnVector` instead of using CachedBatch with `Array[Byte]`.\r\n2. Get a value for a column in `ColumnVector without using an iterator\r\n\r\nAs the first step, for ease of review, I supported only integer and double data types with whole-stage codegen. Another PR will address an execution path without whole-stage codegen\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the follings:\r\n1. Keep a in-memory table cache using `ColumnarBatch` with `ColumnVector`. For supporting the new and coventional cache data structure, this PR declares `CachedBatch` as trait, and declares `CachedColumnarBatch` and `CachedBatchBytes` as actual implementations.\r\n2. Generate Java code to build a in-memory table cache.\r\n3. Generate Java code to directly get value from `ColumnVector`.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves runtime performance by\r\n1. build in-memory table cache by eliminating lots of virtual calls and complicated data path.\r\n2. eliminating data copy from column-oriented storage to `InternalRow` in a `SpecificColumnarIterator` iterator.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Options**\r\nA ColumnVector for all primitive data types in ColumnarBatch can be compressed. Currently, there are two ways to enable compression:\r\n\r\n1. Set true into a property `spark.sql.inMemoryColumnarStorage.compressed (default is true)`, or\r\n2. Call `DataFrame.persist(st)`, where st is `MEMORY_ONLY_SER`, `MEMORY_ONLY_SER_2`, `MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER`, or `MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**an example program**\r\n```java\r\nval df = sparkContext.parallelize((1 to 10), 1).map(i => (i, i.toDouble)).toDF(\"i\", \"d\").cache\r\ndf.filter(\"i < 8 and 4.0 < d\").show\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Generated code for building a in-memory table

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently the `DataFrameWriter` operations have several problems:\r\n\r\n1. non-file-format data source writing action doesn't show up in the SQL tab in Spark UI\r\n2. file-format data source writing action shows a scan node in the SQL tab, without saying anything about writing. (streaming also have this issue, but not fixed in this PR)\r\n3. Spark SQL CLI actions don't show up in the SQL tab.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all of them, by refactoring the `ExecuteCommandExec` to make it have children.\r\n\r\n close https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17540\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests.\r\n\r\nAlso test the UI manually.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, we have a bug when we specify `IF NOT EXISTS` in `INSERT OVERWRITE` data source tables. For example, given a query:\r\n```SQL\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE $tableName partition (b=2, c=3) IF NOT EXISTS SELECT 9, 10\r\n```\r\nwe will get the following error:\r\n```\r\nunresolved operator 'InsertIntoTable Relation[a#425,d#426,b#427,c#428] parquet, Map(b -> Some(2), c -> Some(3)), true, true;;\r\n'InsertIntoTable Relation[a#425,d#426,b#427,c#428] parquet, Map(b -> Some(2), c ->

the exception very confused\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark Metrics System use a **Properties File** to load the configurations but doesn't trim the keys and values. It might cause the exception very confused if the property is a class name. \r\nFor example below, you must do not notice there is a space at the line end.\r\n\r\n> *.sink.ganglia.class=org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.GangliaSink\r\n\r\n \r\nUnfortunately, the **ClassNotFoundException** throwing from Driver also doesn't tell me what happens and confuses me because I am sure the related jar is in the CLASSPATH.\r\n\r\n> 17/05/20 12:47:04 ERROR SparkContext: Error initializing SparkContext.\r\n> java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.spark.metrics.sink.GangliaSink           \r\n> \tat scala.reflect.internal.util.AbstractFileClassLoader.findClass(AbstractFileClassLoader.scala:62)\r\n\r\nAs a reference, I check the code of Log4j, a classic **Properties** using library. It do the trim when load the properties. See org.apache.log4j.filter.PropertyFilter.java\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate Hashtable parseProperties(String props) {\r\n\tHashtable hashTable = new Hashtable();\r\n\tStringTokenizer pairs = new

\"=\");\r\n\t\thashTable.put(entry.nextElement().toString().trim(), entry.nextElement().toString().trim());\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn hashTable;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd unit tests\r\n\r\nAlso can test manually by setting metrics.properties file\r\n(Replace \"_\" with \" \")\r\n\r\n>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds compression/decompression of column data to `ColumnVector`. \r\nWhile current `CachedBatch` can compress column data by using of multiple compression schemes, `ColumnVector` cannot compress column data. The compression is mandatory for table cache.\r\n\r\nAt first, this PR enables the following schemes. Another JIRA will support compression schemes.\r\n1. `RunLengthEncoding` for boolean/byte/short/int/long\r\n2. `BooleanBitSet` for boolean. \r\n\r\nAt high level view, when `ColumnVector.compress()` is called, compression is performed from an array for primitive data type to byte array in `ColumnVector`. When `ColumnVector.decompress()` is called, decompression is performed from the byte array to the array for primitive data type to byte array in `ColumnVector`. `ArrayBuffer` is used for accessing data during compression or decompression.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR added and changed the following APIs:\r\n\r\n`ArrayBuffer`\r\n* This new class is similar to `java.io.ByteBuffer`. `ArrayBuffer` class can wrap an array for any primitive data type such as `Array[Int]` or `Array[Long]`. This class manages current position to be accessed.\r\n\r\n`ColumnType.get(buffer: ArrayBuffer): jvmType, ColumnType.put(buffer: ArrayBuffer)`\r\n* These APIs gets a primitive value from the current position or puts a primitive value into the current position at the given `ArrayBuffer`. \r\n\r\n`Encoder.gatherCompressibilityStats(in: ArrayBuffer)`\r\n* This API calculates uncompressed and compressed size by using a given compression method.\r\n\r\n`Encoder.compress(from: ArrayBuffer, to: ArrayBuffer): Unit`\r\n* This API compresses data in `from` and stores compressed data to `to`. `to` has to have an byte array with enough size for compressed data.\r\n\r\n`Decoder.decompress(values: ArrayBuffer): Unit`\r\n* This API decompresses data in `Decoder` by providing its constructor and stores uncompressed data to `values`. `to` has to have an byte array with enough size for uncompressed data.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test suites","created_at":"2017-05-19T09:36:09Z","updated_at":"2017-10-04T17:00:33Z","closed_at":"2017-10-04T17:00:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0416bdb5304572e377c31aad59eba41fdfada8c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18033/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18033/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18033/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/193a71bb30cd38c5ca3d3c234bf2f1e2b8210f11","head":{"label":"kiszk:SPARK-20807","ref":"SPARK-20807","sha":"193a71bb30cd38c5ca3d3c234bf2f1e2b8210f11","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror
