noticed that version 1.0.6 does not work well with OSGi because it includes all the classes from ftplet-api but it does not export them in the manifests headers. This requires adding the ftplet-api bundle which results in two versions of the same classes on the classpath. This makes custom implementation of Ftpserver interfaces impossible. \n\nI tried to build my own UserManger and User implementation to authenticate against a DB via JPA. I could not do it because I got linkage errors since my implementation depended on the ftplet-api interfaces which are loaded in OSGi via two separate classloaders: one version from the ftpserver-core
