What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTotal tasks in the aggregated table and the tasks table are not matching some times in the WEBUI.\r\nWe need to force update the executor summary of the particular executorId, when ever last task of that executor has reached. Currently it force update based on last task on the stage end. So, for some particular executorId task might miss at the stage end.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTests to reproduce:\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-shell --master yarn --conf spark.executor.instances=3\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10000, 10).map{ x => throw new RuntimeException(\"Bad executor\")}.collect() \r\n```\r\nBefore patch:\r\n![screenshot from 2018-11-15

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe existing query hint implementation relies on a logical plan node `ResolvedHint` to store query hints in logical plans, and on `Statistics` in physical plans. Since `ResolvedHint` is not really a logical operator and can break the pattern matching for existing and future optimization rules, it is a issue to the Optimizer as the old `AnalysisBarrier` was to the Analyzer.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that all our query hints are either 1) a join hint, i.e., broadcast hint; or 2) a re-partition hint, which is indeed an operator, we only need to add a hint field on the Join plan and that will be a good enough solution for the current hint usage.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to let `Join` node have a hint for its left sub-tree and another hint for its right sub-tree and each hint is a merged result of all the effective hints specified in the corresponding sub-tree. The \"effectiveness\" of a hint, i.e., whether that hint should be propagated to the `Join` node, is currently consistent with the hint propagation rules originally implemented in the `Statistics` approach. Note that the `ResolvedHint` node still has to live through the analysis stage because of the `Dataset` interface, but it will be got rid of and moved to the `Join` node in the \"pre-optimization\" stage.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces a change in how hints work with join reordering. Before this PR, hints would stop join reordering. For example, in \"a.join(b).join(c).hint(\"broadcast\").join(d)\", the broadcast hint would stop d from participating in the cost-based join reordering while still allowing reordering from under the hint node. After this PR, though, the broadcast hint will not interfere with join reordering at all, and after reordering if a relation associated with a hint stays unchanged or equivalent to the original relation, the hint will be retained, otherwise will be discarded. For example, the original plan is like \"a.join(b).hint(\"broadcast\").join(c).hint(\"broadcast\").join(d)\", thus the join order is \"a JOIN b JOIN c JOIN d\". So if after reordering the join order becomes \"a JOIN b JOIN (c JOIN d)\", the plan will be like \"a.join(b).hint(\"broadcast\").join(c.join(d))\"; but if after reordering the join order becomes \"a JOIN c JOIN b JOIN d\", the plan will be like \"a.join(c).join(b).hint(\"broadcast\").join(d)\".\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests.","created_at":"2018-11-14T19:07:33Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T22:02:48Z","closed_at":"2019-01-07T22:02:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3514c1e13d505c4995a07a39aaefddbc2e674339","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23036/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23036/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23036/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/97377dd5fbf62fe02eafcd99cac4e4c1f235e8d3","head":{"label":"maryannxue:query-hint","ref":"query-hint","sha":"97377dd5fbf62fe02eafcd99cac4e4c1f235e8d3","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReduce the number of unused `UnsafeRowWriter`s created in whole-stage generated code.\r\nThey come from the `CodegenSupport.consume()` calling `prepareRowVar()`, which uses `GenerateUnsafeProjection.createCode()` and registers an `UnsafeRowWriter` mutable state, regardless of whether or not the downstream (parent) operator will use the `rowVar` or not.\r\nEven when the downstream `doConsume` function doesn't use the `rowVar` (i.e. doesn't put `row.code` as a part of this operator's codegen template), the registered `UnsafeRowWriter` stays there, which makes the init function of the generated code a bit bloated.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't heal the root issue, but makes it slightly less painful: when the `doConsume` function is split out, the `prepareRowVar()` function is called twice, so it's double the pain of unused `UnsafeRowWriter`s. This PR simply moves the original call to `prepareRowVar()` down into the `doConsume` split/no-split branch so that we're back to just 1x the pain.\r\n\r\nTo fix the root issue, something that allows the `CodegenSupport` operators to indicate whether or not they're going to use the `rowVar` would be needed. That's a much more elaborate change so I'd like to just make a minor fix first.\r\n\r\ne.g. for this query: `spark.range(10).as[Long].map(x => x + 1).map(x => x * x + 2)`\r\n**Before** (in Spark 2.4.0):\r\n```java\r\n/* 023 */   public void init(int index, scala.collection.Iterator[] inputs) {\r\n/* 024 */     partitionIndex = index;\r\n/* 025 */     this.inputs = inputs;\r\n/* 026 */\r\n/*

We should track `SparkConf` entries and make the command reject for such entries.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test and existing

[SPARK-26024](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26024), I noticed the number of elements in each partition after repartitioning using `df.repartitionByRange` can vary for the same setup:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// Shuffle numbers from 0 to 1000, and make a DataFrame\r\nval df = Random.shuffle(0.to(1000)).toDF(\"val\")\r\n\r\n// Repartition it using 3 partitions\r\n// Sum up number of elements in each partition, and collect it.\r\n// And do it several times\r\nfor (i <- 0 to 9) {\r\n  var counts = df.repartitionByRange(3, col(\"val\"))\r\n    .mapPartitions{part => Iterator(part.size)}\r\n    .collect()\r\n  println(counts.toList)\r\n}\r\n// -> the number of elements in each partition varies\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is expected as for performance reasons this method uses sampling to estimate the ranges (with default size of 100). Hence, the output may not be consistent, since sampling can return different values. But documentation was not mentioning it at all, leading to misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdate the documentation (Spark & PySpark) to mention the impact of `spark.sql.execution.rangeExchange.sampleSizePerPartition` on the resulting partitioned DataFrame.","created_at":"2018-11-13T21:01:56Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T19:20:43Z","closed_at":"2018-11-20T00:27:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d893dccd5dee68fd64cfc190684fdb6210601aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23025/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23025/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23025/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7ca48214cda312d78c22ad4305d2e490c46535f5","head":{"label":"JulienPeloton:SPARK-26024","ref":"SPARK-26024","sha":"7ca48214cda312d78c22ad4305d2e490c46535f5","user":{"login":"JulienPeloton","id":20426972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI2OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20426972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton","html_url":"https://github.com/JulienPeloton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157442428,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc0NDI0Mjg=","name":"spark","full_name":"JulienPeloton/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JulienPeloton","id":20426972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI2OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20426972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton","html_url":"https://github.com/JulienPeloton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JulienPeloton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JulienPeloton/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is the official first attempt to break huge single `tests.py` file - I did it locally before few times and gave up for some reasons. Now, currently it really makes the unittests super hard to read and difficult to check. To me, it even bothers me to to scroll down the big file. It's one single 7000 lines file!\r\n\r\nThis is not only readability issue. Since one big test takes most of tests time, the tests don't run in parallel fully - although it will costs to start and stop the context.\r\n\r\nWe could pick up one example and follow. Given my investigation, the current style looks closer to NumPy structure and looks easier to follow. Please see https://github.com/numpy/numpy/tree/master/numpy.\r\n\r\nBasically this PR proposes to break down `pyspark/sql/tests.py` into ...:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npyspark\r\n...\r\n├── sql\r\n...\r\n│   ├── tests  # Includes all tests broken down from 'pyspark/sql/tests.py'\r\n│   │   │      # Each matchs to module in 'pyspark/sql'. Additionally, some logical group can\r\n│   │   │      # be added. For instance, 'test_arrow.py', 'test_datasources.py' ...\r\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_appsubmit.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_arrow.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_catalog.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_column.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_conf.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_context.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_dataframe.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_datasources.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_functions.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_group.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_pandas_udf.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_pandas_udf_grouped_agg.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_pandas_udf_grouped_map.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_pandas_udf_scalar.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_pandas_udf_window.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_readwriter.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_serde.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_session.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_streaming.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_types.py\r\n│   │   ├── test_udf.py\r\n│   │   └── test_utils.py\r\n...\r\n├── testing  # Includes testing utils that can be used in unittests.\r\n│   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   └── sqlutils.py\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover.\r\n\r\n`cd python` and `./run-tests-with-coverage`.

\"build context\" for a docker image - basically the whole contents of the\r\ncurrent directory where \"docker\" is invoked - can be huge in a dev build,\r\neasily breaking a couple of gigs.\r\n\r\nDoing that copy 3 times during the build of docker images severely slows\r\ndown the process.\r\n\r\nThis patch creates a smaller build context - basically mimicking what the\r\nmake-distribution.sh script does, so that when building the docker images,\r\nonly the necessary bits are in the current directory. For PySpark and R that\r\nis optimized further, since those images are built based on the previously\r\nbuilt Spark main image.\r\n\r\nIn my current local clone, the dir size is about 2G, but with this script\r\nthe \"context\" sent to docker is about 250M for the main image, 1M for the\r\npyspark image and 8M for the R image. That speeds up the image builds\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nI also snuck in a fix to the k8s integration test dependencies in the sbt\r\nbuild, so that the examples are properly built (without having to do it\r\nmanually).","created_at":"2018-11-12T22:30:51Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T21:56:21Z","closed_at":"2018-11-27T17:14:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d8f6eddd737145b25be60884990d8071a41ab03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4439543cc8e320542cd8f6826662c541d18e0a72","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-26025","ref":"SPARK-26025","sha":"4439543cc8e320542cd8f6826662c541d18e0a72","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose new method for debugging queries by dumping info about their execution to a file. It saves logical, optimized and physical plan similar to the `explain()` method + generated code. One of the advantages of the method over `explain` is it does not materializes full output as one string in memory which can cause OOMs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a few tests to `QueryExecutionSuite` to check positive and negative scenarios.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-12T21:36:07Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:32:57Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T14:28:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e132fde03d7e9386e47d49cfe7d139fb87254773","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cdc6cabdc0c8f2d53e95ebe5843e11cfb629f752","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:truncated-plan-to-file","ref":"truncated-plan-to-file","sha":"cdc6cabdc0c8f2d53e95ebe5843e11cfb629f752","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds USER directives to the Dockerfiles which is configurable via build argument (`spark_uid`) for easy customisation.  A `-u` flag is added to `bin/docker-image-tool.sh` to make it easy to customise this e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r rvesse -t uid -u 185 build\r\n> bin/docker-image-tool.sh -r rvesse -t uid push\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf no UID is explicitly specified it defaults to `185` - this is per @skonto's suggestion to align with the OpenShift standard reserved UID for Java apps ( \r\nhttps://lists.openshift.redhat.com/openshift-archives/users/2016-March/msg00283.html)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- We have to make the `WORKDIR` writable by the root group or otherwise jobs will fail with `AccessDeniedException`\r\n\r\nTo Do:\r\n- [x] Debug and resolve issue with client mode test\r\n- [x] Consider whether to always propagate `SPARK_USER_NAME` to environment of driver and executor pods so `entrypoint.sh` can insert that into `/etc/passwd` entry\r\n- [x] Rebase once PR #23013 is merged and update documentation accordingly\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBuilt the Docker images with the new Dockerfiles that include the `USER` directives.  Ran the Spark on K8S integration tests against the new images.  All pass except client mode which I am currently debugging further.\r\n\r\nAlso manually dropped myself into the resulting container images via `docker run` and checked `id -u` output to see that UID is as expected.\r\n\r\nTried customising the UID from the default via the new `-u` argument to `docker-image-tool.sh` and again checked the resulting image for the correct runtime UID.\r\n\r\ncc

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR PySpark patched ``collections.namedtuple`` to make\r\nnamedtuple instances serializable even if the namedtuple class has been\r\ndefined outside of ``globals()``, e.g.\r\n\r\n    def do_something():\r\n        Foo = namedtuple(\"Foo\", [\"foo\"])\r\n        sc.parallelize(range(1)).map(lambda _: Foo(42))\r\n\r\nThe patch changed the pickled representation of the namedtuple instance\r\nto include the structure of namedtuple class, and recreate the class on\r\neach unpickling. This behaviour causes hard to diagnose failures both\r\nin the user code with namedtuples, as well as third-party libraries\r\nrelying on them. See [1] and [2] for details.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://superbobry.github.io/pyspark-silently-breaks-your-namedtuples.html\r\n[2]: https://superbobry.github.io/tensorflowonspark-or-the-namedtuple-patch-strikes-again.html\r\n\r\nThe PR changes the default serializer to `CloudPickleSerializer` which natively supports pickling namedtuples and does not require the aforementioned patch.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-24638](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24638) adds support for Parquet file `StartsWith` predicate push down.\r\n`InMemoryTable` can also support this feature.\r\n\r\nThis is an example to explain how it works, Imagine that the `id` column stored as below:\r\n\r\nPartition ID | lowerBound | upperBound\r\n-- | -- | --\r\np1 | '1' | '9'\r\np2 | '10' | '19'\r\np3 | '20' | '29'\r\np4 | '30' | '39'\r\np5 | '40' | '49'\r\n\r\nA filter ```df.filter($\"id\".startsWith(\"2\"))``` or ```id like '2%'```\r\nthen we substr lowerBound and upperBound:\r\n \r\nPartition ID | lowerBound.substr(0, Length(\"2\")) | upperBound.substr(0, Length(\"2\"))\r\n-- | -- | --\r\np1 | '1' | '9'\r\np2 | '1' | '1'\r\np3 | '2' | '2'\r\np4 | '3' | '3'\r\np5 | '4' | '4'\r\n\r\nWe can see that we only need to read `p1` and `p3`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n unit tests and benchmark tests\r\n\r\nbenchmark test result:\r\n```\r\n================================================================================================\r\nPushdown benchmark for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `SQLAppStatusListener.aggregateMetrics`, we use the `metricIds` only to filter the relevant metrics. And this is a Seq which is also sorted. When there are many metrics involved, this can be pretty inefficient. The PR proposes to use a Set for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

This is because R/check_cran.sh builds R document which depends on hadoop dependencies in assembly/target/scala-xxx/jars folder.\r\nTo reproduce:\r\nMAVEN_BUILD_OPTS=\"-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive -Psparkr -Phadoop-provided\"\r\n./dev/make-distribution.sh --tgz --r $MAVEN_BUILD_OPTS\r\n \r\nError:\r\ncreating vignettes ...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the broadcast object in TorrentBroadcast from a strong reference to a weak reference. This allows it to be garbage collected even if the Dataset is held in memory. This is ok, because the broadcast object can always be re-read.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested in Spark shell by taking a heap dump, full repro steps listed in

Other related changes to get JDK 11 working, to test\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Access `sun.misc.Cleaner` (Java 8) and `jdk.internal.ref.Cleaner` (JDK 9+) by reflection (note: the latter only works if illegal reflective access is allowed)\r\n- Access `sun.misc.Unsafe.invokeCleaner` in Java 9+ instead of `sun.misc.Cleaner` (Java 8)\r\n\r\nIn order to test anything on JDK 11, I also fixed a few small things, which I include here:\r\n\r\n- Fix minor JDK 11 compile issues\r\n- Update scala plugin, Jetty for JDK 11, to facilitate tests too\r\n\r\nThis doesn't mean JDK 11 tests all pass now, but lots do. Note also that the JDK 9+ solution for the Cleaner has a big caveat.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. Manually tested JDK 11 build and tests, and tests covering this change appear to pass. All Java 8 tests should still pass, but this change alone does not achieve full JDK 11 compatibility.","created_at":"2018-11-09T17:11:54Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T04:27:43Z","closed_at":"2018-11-14T20:54:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65a8c5101b47057f93b9e8f57f61e5eed73f0e16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22993/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22993/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22993/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2ee58b2ba66fbf497e819feff9beb786d4884acd","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-24421","ref":"SPARK-24421","sha":"2ee58b2ba66fbf497e819feff9beb786d4884acd","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOur `GBTClassifier` supports only `variance` impurity. But unfortunately, its `impurity` param by default contains the value `gini`: it is not even modifiable by the user and it differs from the actual impurity used, which is `variance`. This issue does not limit to a wrong value returned for it if the user queries by `getImpurity`, but it also affect the load of a saved model, as its `impurityStats` are created as `gini` (since this is the value stored for the model impurity) which leads to wrong `featureImportances` in model loaded from saved ones.\r\n\r\nThe PR changes the `impurity` param used to one which allows only the value `variance`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmodified

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `SQLQueryTestSuite` is sensitive in terms of the bytes of parquet files in table partitions. If we change the default file format (from Parquet to ORC) or update the metadata of them, the test case should be changed accordingly. This PR aims to make `SQLQueryTestSuite` more robust by ignoring the partition byte statistics.\r\n```\r\n-Partition Statistics   1144 bytes, 2 rows\r\n+Partition Statistics   [not included in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRunning a barrier job after a normal spark job causes the barrier job to run without a BarrierTaskContext. This is because while python worker reuse, BarrierTaskContext._getOrCreate() will still return a TaskContext after firstly submit a normal spark job, we'll get a `AttributeError: 'TaskContext' object has no attribute 'barrier'`. Fix this by adding check logic in BarrierTaskContext._getOrCreate() and make sure it will return BarrierTaskContext in this scenario.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new UT in pyspark-core.","created_at":"2018-11-07T10:05:40Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T06:33:50Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T09:10:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4066822e000b1a8701f40fc6e2e47dff6dccc9f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02555b8fbdf85c3f2b5a92420479c168e14b573c","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-25921","ref":"SPARK-25921","sha":"02555b8fbdf85c3f2b5a92420479c168e14b573c","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen sorting rows, ShuffleExchangeExec uses the entire row instead of just the columns references in SortOrder to create the RangePartitioner. This causes the RangePartitioner to sample entire rows to create rangeBounds and can cause OOM issues on the driver when rows contain large fields.\r\n\r\nThis change creates a projection and only use columns involved in the SortOrder for the RangePartitioner\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests in spark-sql. \r\n\r\nPlus\r\n\r\nStarted a local spark-shell with a small spark.driver.maxResultSize:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-shell --master 'local[16]' --conf spark.driver.maxResultSize=128M --driver-memory 4g\r\n```\r\n\r\nand ran the following script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport com.google.common.io.Files\r\nimport org.apache.spark.SparkContext\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n\r\nimport scala.util.Random\r\n\r\n@transient val sc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()\r\n@transient val spark = SparkSession.builder().getOrCreate()\r\n\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\n\r\nval path = Files.createTempDir().toString\r\n\r\n// this creates a dataset with 1024 entries, each 1MB in size, across 16 partitions\r\nsc.parallelize(0 until (1 << 10), sc.defaultParallelism).\r\n  map(_ => Array.fill(1 << 18)(Random.nextInt)).\r\n  toDS.\r\n  write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(path)\r\n\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).\r\n  orderBy('value (0)).\r\n  write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(s\"$path-sorted\")\r\n\r\nspark.read.parquet(s\"$path-sorted\").show\r\n```\r\nexecution would fail when initializing RangePartitioner without this change.\r\nexecution succeeds and generates a correctly sorted dataset with this change.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-07T01:45:29Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T16:30:26Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T16:30:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df8265a6a683689230a147e14035d1e1db6412c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22961/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22961/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22961/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6dd50b02f607c6f1b34b00e85a2c0e11bc8518ff","head":{"label":"mu5358271:sort-improvement","ref":"sort-improvement","sha":"6dd50b02f607c6f1b34b00e85a2c0e11bc8518ff","user":{"login":"mu5358271","id":10017228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE3MjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10017228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271","html_url":"https://github.com/mu5358271","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156322668,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTYzMjI2Njg=","name":"spark-on-fargate","full_name":"mu5358271/spark-on-fargate","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mu5358271","id":10017228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE3MjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10017228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271","html_url":"https://github.com/mu5358271","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mu5358271/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mu5358271/spark-on-fargate","description":"Serverless

are a few issues with the current configuration types used in\r\nthe kubernetes backend:\r\n\r\n- they use type parameters for role-specific specialization, which makes\r\n  type signatures really noisy throughout the code base.\r\n\r\n- they break encapsulation by forcing the code that creates the config\r\n  object to remove the configuration from SparkConf before creating the\r\n  k8s-specific wrapper.\r\n\r\n- they don't provide an easy way for tests to have default values for\r\n  fields they do not use.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes those problems by:\r\n\r\n- creating a base config type with role-specific specialization using\r\n  inheritance\r\n\r\n- encapsulating the logic of parsing SparkConf into k8s-specific views\r\n  inside the k8s config classes\r\n\r\n- providing some helper code for tests to easily override just the part\r\n  of the configs they want.\r\n\r\nMost of the change relates to the above, especially cleaning up the\r\ntests. While doing that, I also made some smaller changes elsewhere:\r\n\r\n- removed unnecessary type parameters in KubernetesVolumeSpec\r\n\r\n- simplified the error detection logic in KubernetesVolumeUtils; all\r\n  the call sites would just throw the first exception collected by\r\n  that class, since they all called \"get\" on the \"Try\" object. Now\r\n  the unnecessary wrapping is gone and the exception is just thrown\r\n  where it occurs.\r\n\r\n- removed a lot of unnecessary mocking from tests.\r\n\r\n- changed the kerberos-related code so that less logic needs to live\r\n  in the driver builder. In spirit it should be part of the upcoming\r\n  work in this series of cleanups, but it made parts of this change\r\n  simpler.\r\n\r\nTested with existing unit tests and integration tests.","created_at":"2018-11-06T18:26:20Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T21:55:20Z","closed_at":"2018-12-01T00:28:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"022cd44353439b3e8243de4ba1c27cf13a839496","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22959/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22959/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22959/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/516ae6816a8521e944fa7471f2c069dbfc93ecfe","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-25876","ref":"SPARK-25876","sha":"516ae6816a8521e944fa7471f2c069dbfc93ecfe","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we canonicalize an `Expression`, we do not remove `Alias`. So two expressions which are the same but are renamed are considered to be semantically different. As we rely on semantic equality in order to check if the result is the same for 2 expressions, some optimizations - as showed in the JIRA - may fail to apply, eg. removing redundant shuffles, when a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to support Arrow optimization for conversion from R DataFrame to Spark DataFrame.\r\nLike PySpark side, it falls back to non-optimization code path when it's unable to use Arrow optimization.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n```r\r\ncollect(createDataFrame(mtcars))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n  - R 3.5.x \r\n  - Arrow package 0.12+\r\n    ```bash\r\n    Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"apache/arrow@apache-arrow-0.12.0\", subdir = \"r\")'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n**Note:** currently, Arrow R package is not in CRAN. Please take a look at ARROW-3204.\r\n**Note:** currently, Arrow R package seems not supporting Windows. Please take a look at ARROW-3204.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\n\r\n**Shall**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsync && sudo purge\r\n./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=false\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsync && sudo purge\r\n./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n**R code**\r\n\r\n```r\r\ncreateDataFrame(mtcars) # Initializes\r\nrdf <- read.csv(\"500000.csv\")\r\n\r\ntest <- function() {\r\n  options(digits.secs = 6) # milliseconds\r\n  start.time <- Sys.time()\r\n  createDataFrame(rdf)\r\n  end.time <- Sys.time()\r\n  time.taken <- end.time - start.time\r\n  print(time.taken)\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Data (350 MB):**\r\n\r\n```r\r\nobject.size(read.csv(\"500000.csv\"))\r\n350379504 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"500000 Records\"  http://eforexcel.com/wp/downloads-16-sample-csv-files-data-sets-for-testing/\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTime difference of 29.9468 secs\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nTime difference of 3.222129 secs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe performance improvement was around **950%**.\r\nActually, this PR improves around **1200%**+ because this PR includes a small optimization about regular R DataFrame -> Spark DatFrame. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22954#discussion_r231847272\r\n\r\n### Limitations:\r\n\r\nFor now, Arrow optimization with R does not support when the data is `raw`, and when user explicitly gives float type in the schema. They produce corrupt values.\r\nIn this case, we decide to fall back to non-optimization code path.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSmall test was added.\r\n\r\nI manually forced to set this optimization `true` for _all_ R tests and they were _all_ passed (with few of fallback warnings).\r\n\r\n**TODOs:**\r\n- [x] Draft codes\r\n- [x] make the tests passed\r\n- [x] make the CRAN check pass\r\n- [x] Performance measurement\r\n- [x] Supportability investigation (for instance types)\r\n- [x] Wait for Arrow 0.12.0 release\r\n- [x] Fix and match it to Arrow 0.12.0\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-06T09:45:02Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:20:05Z","closed_at":"2019-01-27T02:46:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"00fab64ae2d27d519324c632fe41dc172a42788d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22954/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22954/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22954/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/66b120b3dbf3d0e6581429ec6cf10131452b5bb7","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:r-arrow-createdataframe","ref":"r-arrow-createdataframe","sha":"66b120b3dbf3d0e6581429ec6cf10131452b5bb7","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the option to clean up files which are completed in previous batch.\r\n\r\n`cleanSource` -> \"archive\" / \"delete\" / \"off\"\r\n\r\nThe default value is \"off\", which Spark will do nothing.\r\n\r\nIf \"delete\" is specified, Spark will simply delete input files. If \"archive\" is specified, Spark will require additional config `sourceArchiveDir` which will be used to move input files to there. When archiving (via move) the path of input files are retained to the archived paths as sub-path.\r\n\r\nNote that it is only applied to \"micro-batch\", since for batch all input files must be kept to get same result across multiple query executions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT. Manual test against local disk as well as HDFS.","created_at":"2018-11-05T22:18:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T01:49:40Z","closed_at":"2019-11-04T23:16:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15124d5d4c24d20459601e354030a4727d22a542","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when two adjacent window functions have the same partition and the same intersection of order, \r\n There will be two sorted after shuffling, which is not necessary.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`Dataset.groupByKey` will bring in new attributes from serializer. If key type is the same as original Dataset's object type, they have same serializer output and so the attribute names will conflict.\r\n\r\nThis won't be a problem at most of cases, if we don't refer conflict attributes:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval ds: Dataset[(ClassData, Long)] = Seq(ClassData(\"one\", 1), ClassData(\"two\", 2)).toDS()\r\n  .map(c => ClassData(c.a, c.b + 1))\r\n  .groupByKey(p => p).count()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if we use conflict attributes, `Analyzer` will complain about ambiguous references:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval ds = Seq(1, 2, 3).toDS()\r\nval agg = ds.groupByKey(_ >= 2).agg(sum(\"value\").as[Long], sum($\"value\" + 1).as[Long])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have discussed two fixes https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22944#discussion_r230977212:\r\n\r\n1. Implicitly add alias to key attribute:\r\n\r\nWorks for primitive type. But for product type, we can't implicitly add aliases to key attributes because we might need to access key attributes by  names in methods like `mapGroups`.\r\n\r\n2. Detect conflict from key attributes and warn users to add alias manually\r\n\r\nThis might work, but needs to add some hacks to Analyzer or AttributeSeq.resolve.\r\n\r\nThis patch applies another simpler fix. We resolve aggregate expressions with `AppendColumns`'s children, instead of `AppendColumns`. `AppendColumns`'s output contains its children's output and serializer output, aggregate expressions shouldn't use serializer output.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded
