releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>ICU 73.2</h2>\n<p><em><strong>draft</strong></em></p>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Unicode® ICU 73.2. It updates to <a href=\"https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-43#h.qobmda543waj\">CLDR 43.1</a> locale data with various additions and corrections. These are maintenance releases for ICU 73 and CLDR 43, with limited sets of bug fixes and no API or structural changes.</p>\n<p>There are significant changes for <a href=\"https://ken-lunde.medium.com/the-gb-18030-2022-standard-3d0ebaeb4132\">GB18030-2022</a> compliance support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CLDR extends the support for “short” Chinese sort orders to cover some additional, required characters for Level 2. This is carried over into ICU collation.</li>\n<li>ICU has a modified character conversion table, mapping some GB18030 characters to Unicode characters that were encoded after GB18030-2005.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also changes for compatibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are optional variants of time formats with AM/PM (only for English) using ASCII spaces in CLDR that can also be used in ICU via custom data generation. This is intended to help certain implementers transition to the improved patterns, which have used a narrow no-break space between the time and AM/PM since <a href=\"https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-42#h.ck7cpcrqqrq0\">CLDR 42</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>For how to generate ICU data with this option, look for alt=&quot;ascii&quot; on<a href=\"https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/main/tools/cldr/cldr-to-icu/README.md\"> main/tools/cldr/cldr-to-icu/README.md</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The changes to the word segmentation behavior of @ sign that were in CLDR 42 (ICU 72) have been reverted. These caused problems for certain parsers that did not expect @ to join to letters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ICU 73.2 and CLDR 43.1 include several other bug fixes, including person name formatting, and Cyrillic transforms.</p>\n<p>For details, please see <a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/download/73\">https://icu.unicode.org/download/73</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The prebuilt WinARM64 binaries below should be considered alpha/experimental.</em></p>\n<h2>ICU 73.1</h2>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Unicode® ICU 73. It updates to <a href=\"https://blog.unicode.org/2023/04/the-unicode-cldr-v43-released.html\">CLDR 43</a> locale data with various additions and corrections.</p>\n<p>ICU 73 improves Japanese and Korean short-text line breaking, reduces C++ memory use in date formatting, and promotes the Java person name formatter from tech preview to draft.</p>\n<p>ICU 73 and CLDR 43 are minor releases, mostly focused on bug fixes and small enhancements. (The fall CLDR/ICU releases will update to Unicode 15.1 which is planned for September.)</p>\n<p>ICU 73 updates to the time zone data version 2023c (2023-mar). Note that pre-1970 data for a number of time zones has been removed, as has been the case in the upstream <a href=\"https://www.iana.org/time-zones\">tzdata</a> release since 2021b.</p>\n<p>For details, please see <a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/download/73\">https://icu.unicode.org/download/73</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The prebuilt WinARM64 binaries below should be considered alpha/experimental.</em></p>\n<h2>ICU 73 RC</h2>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the release candidate for Unicode® ICU 73.

href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/releases\">azure-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>azure-core_1.40.0</h2>\n<h2>1.40.0 (2023-06-02)</h2>\n<h3>Features Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>TracingOptions</code> configurations allowing to pick a specific <code>TracerProvider</code> implementation if several are resolved by <code>ServiceLoader</code>.</li>\n<li>Added <code>MetricsOptions</code> configurations allowing to pick a specific <code>MeterProvider</code> implementation if several are resolved by <code>ServiceLoader</code>.</li>\n<li>Added <code>CoreUtils.randomUuid</code> to replace usage of <code>UUID.randomUUID</code>. In some cases <code>UUID.randomUUID</code> used a blocking\ncall whereas <code>CoreUtils.randomUuid</code> should never block. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/34790\">#34790</a>)</li>\n<li>Added support for prefixes in <code>AzureKeyCredentialPolicy</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35010\">#35010</a>)</li>\n<li>Added the ability to configure a backoff strategy for <code>FluxUtil.createRetriableDownloadFlux</code>. Previous retries\nwouldn't backoff which could result in requests being sent to a service already at capacity and throttling. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35035\">#35035</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug where a known length wasn't passed to <code>BinaryData.fromStream</code> resulting it being handled as a\nnon-replayable <code>BinaryData</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/34851\">#34851</a>)</li>\n<li>Changed the design of how <code>AsynchronousByteChannel</code>s were written to limit chances of race conditions between the\nwriter thread and the Reactor thread handling <code>onComplete</code> and <code>onError</code> events. This results in more consistent\nbehavior at the cost of lower throughput, which will be investigated in future releases. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35004\">#35004</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed how <code>ResponseError</code> is deserialized to support cases where the JSON wrapped the <code>ResponseError</code> with an\n<code>error</code> property. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/35052\">#35052</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependency Updates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded Reactor Core from <code>3.4.27</code> to <code>3.4.29</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/fd4ed4402038bf529d02642ed037a4669b396f1a\"><code>fd4ed44</code></a> Event Grid Readme Issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/33772\">#33772</a> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/35269\">#35269</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/fd53a935a0f7978278b11c8479cdbb179d9c080d\"><code>fd53a93</code></a> Don't pass logger to toURI (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/35279\">#35279</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/4660a386553f23eb27d4a0bfd96b03bb73dc5c92\"><code>4660a38</code></a> Prepare Core Libraries for June 2023 Release (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/35276\">#35276</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/07cff324776ef8433a2c88cf5bf92c35778fb898\"><code>07cff32</code></a> Attempt to stabilize flaky Core tests (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/35263\">#35263</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/4d3a9c3060a6afcbb181a142cf311a4f9f11e959\"><code>4d3a9c3</code></a> Don't save the payload to an environment variable (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/35277\">#35277</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/a05f50270c720392094f23a9bd5a6fff48e13e8a\"><code>a05f502</code></a> sync 5.2.0 changelog (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/35274\">#35274</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/c08b900af1f78b856c8d0a8e1421ffb6999e9f46\"><code>c08b900</code></a> update spring reference (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/35273\">#35273</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/88daf5ed88fad64c286f702ba720c7ef036d4084\"><code>88daf5e</code></a> Re-enable usage of HttpResponse.writeBodyTo (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/35209\">#35209</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/d8f2a223036bf569d767d5fd51b9c72318c57de4\"><code>d8f2a22</code></a> [Keyvault - administration] Migrate recordings to asset repo (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/35249\">#35249</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/commit/d842aa3fc50454bffa7f5cf00ccbf90dce8fb183\"><code>d842aa3</code></a> migrate recordings, initial push (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/35248\">#35248</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/compare/azure-core_1.39.0...azure-core_1.40.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.azure:azure-core&package-manager=maven&previous-version=1.39.0&new-version=1.40.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
