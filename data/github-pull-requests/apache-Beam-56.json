issues fixed:\r\n   1. Retry behavior was incorrect. We created a new stream abandoning the old, but then only retried the current append.\r\n   2.  Offset was inadvertently reset to 0 the first time we called append, which meant that the second append would always fail with invalid offset. This triggered the data-loss bug in 1.\r\n\r\nWe fixed the offset bug and no longer create a new stream on failure. In cases where the stream is known to be unusable (e.g. it's been deleted), we raise an exception which forces retry of the entire work

PR adds basic progress tracking and dynamic splitting to prism.\r\n\r\nThis is basic support to pass basic separation harness tests with additional configuration to come at a later time. \r\n\r\nThe split is always to the remaining third of elements in an executing bundle, and only if progress doesn't advance for a bundle between progress requests. Progress and splits are tracked in the same goroutine that is managing the rest of the bundle, with data completion triggering exit of the progress loop. \r\n\r\nData completion is now signaled with a channel close, allowing progress requests to occur on a ticker channel, avoiding blocking sleep calls. \r\n\r\nWhen additional bundles are generated, parallel bundle processing will occur to a set limit (currently 8, to be configurable later).\r\n \r\nAdds support for monitoring_short_id's runner capability & adjusts the tests accordingly. Removes support for non-short id metrics.\r\n\r\nFixes memory leak in worker bundle tracking, where the bundle and data were not getting GCd.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PortableBundleManager in Samza Runner\r\n\r\nChanges from ClassicBundleManager\r\n1. The state variables need to be updated atomically. Now they are bundled together using a synchronized block instead of individual atomics.\r\n2. Change the atomic variables to primitives, since they are already in a synchronized block.\r\n3. Remove the future collector and future watermarks. Now we can send watermarks once the bundle is finished.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added Support for generating throughput, watermark progress & latency metric emission \r\n- A MetricOp is attached to each input & output\r\n- Throughput Metrics are emitted for input and output throughput \r\n- Watermark Progress Metrics are emitting at the during-process watermark of output \r\n- Latency Metrics are emitted by collecting  avg arrival time at input & output for each transform using formula Latency = Avg Arrival Time of Elements at Output - Avg Arrival Time of Elements at Input \r\n\r\n\r\n**Tests**\r\n- Added new mocking tests For Injecting MetricOp\r\n- Added end-to-end tests for Metric Compute & Emission \r\n- All existing runners tests (samza:validateRunner) case pass\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

will ensure that the nexus repo we're about to publish is up to date and has all files we need.\r\n\r\n2 decisions to call out here:\r\n1) I decided to manually keep a list of artifacts and fail if its out of date. I did this because there's not a good way to determine which gradle artifacts should be published without walking the file system and parsing contents AFAIK. This shouldn't be too noisy and should keep itself up to date. The consequences of a bad signal are ~5 minutes of toil.\r\n2) I ran this during rc_validation instead of during build_rc_candidate. This is because there's not a good way to access open staged nexus repos programatically, so you basically have to close it first.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

amd64 platform and fixes bugs notably in Windows packaging.</p>\n<p>A few days ago, we released <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases/tag/v1.0.2\">wazero v1.0.2</a>, which notably improved compilation performance. A lot of folks jumped on that release and we found a few glitches in the process. Meanwhile <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> finished up optimization work on amd64 compilation.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the notable fixes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows (MSI and winget) installers didn't set the PATH correctly, so wazero wasn't a one-step install. <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> fixed this by updating our infrastructure to the latest native WiX toolchain, scrubbing some other glitches along the way. Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/inliquid\"><code>@​inliquid</code></a> for reporting this and verifying the fix.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jerbob92\"><code>@​jerbob92</code></a> has been porting various PDF libraries to compile to wasm, and in the process noticed we didn't handle invalid file descriptors properly. <a href=\"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt\"><code>@​codefromthecrypt</code></a> changed our internal code to treat file descriptors as signed integers and negative ones as EBADF.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jerbob92\"><code>@​jerbob92</code></a> also noticed compiler cache corruption when you switch on and off experimental function listeners. <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> fixed this bug.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kevburnsjr\"><code>@​kevburnsjr</code></a> tried to copy/paste some of our godoc examples and they had drifted. Thanks for fixing that!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks so much for being such an engaging community, where opportunities and misses can action so quickly!

Changes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IMPORTANT: This release fixes a security vulnerability in the\nparser where a regular expression vulnerable to ReDOS (Regular\nExpression Denial of Service) was used. See the security advisory\nfor details: <a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/security/advisories/GHSA-rrm6-wvj7-cwh2\">https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/security/advisories/GHSA-rrm6-wvj7-cwh2</a>\nThe vulnerability was discovered by <a href=\"https://github.com/erik-krogh\"><code>@​erik-krogh</code></a> from GitHub\nSecurity Lab (GHSL). Thanks for reporting!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bug Fixes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revert a change from 0.4.0 that changed IN to be a comparison (issue694).\nThe primary expectation is that IN is treated as a keyword and not as a\ncomparison operator. That also follows the definition of reserved keywords\nfor the major SQL syntax definitions.</li>\n<li>Fix regular expressions for string parsing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sqlparse now uses pyproject.toml instead of setup.cfg (issue685).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/647d1457acf7d88614215841eb15d423df2a1895\"><code>647d145</code></a> Update Changelog.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/58dae6fcd2a51209aeccd4fff3b923bf37714e19\"><code>58dae6f</code></a> Bump version.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/d9d69f47ed13a583c81473211f44ae320470a58b\"><code>d9d69f4</code></a> Removed test file</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/64bb91f4880b46f73b4cc9207ae9ccc180d56d1b\"><code>64bb91f</code></a> Testing branch</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/c457abd5f097dd13fb21543381e7cfafe7d31cfb\"><code>c457abd</code></a> Remove unnecessary parts in regex for bad escaping.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/b949fdf9a1538f98b57612bef6306fc38f32aaf7\"><code>b949fdf</code></a> CI: Use codecov action.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/fc76056fb8f0ec713a3f2a2b6206a3336932c382\"><code>fc76056</code></a> Cleanup regex for detecting keywords (fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/issues/709\">#709</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/7fdb2da82d51a9a02baaefb5c7fe5cbbaac4329e\"><code>7fdb2da</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/issues/633\">#633</a> from shikanime/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/dd9d5b91d7aa30e4a000d5370f09dc99378891dc\"><code>dd9d5b9</code></a> Fix get_type with comments between WITH keyword</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/907fb496f90f2719095a1f01fe24db1e5c0e15a8\"><code>907fb49</code></a> change singleton behavior</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/compare/0.4.3...0.4.4\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sqlparse&package-manager=pip&previous-version=0.4.3&new-version=0.4.4)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
