request?\r\n\r\nIf a CodegenFallback expression has nullSafeEval method, code-gen it in the WholeStageCodegen class, and then the common sub-expressions will be eliminated.\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT from_json(regexp_replace(s, 'a', 'x'), 'x INT, b DOUBLE').x,\r\n       from_json(regexp_replace(s, 'a', 'x'), 'x INT, b DOUBLE').b\r\nFROM values('{\"a\":1, \"b\":0.8}') t(s)\r\n```\r\nplan:\r\n```\r\n*(1) Project [from_json(StructField(x,IntegerType,true), regexp_replace(s#218, a, x, 1), Some(America/Los_Angeles)).x AS from_json(regexp_replace(s, a, x, 1)).x#219, from_json(StructField(b,DoubleType,true), regexp_replace(s#218, a, x, 1), Some(America/Los_Angeles)).b AS from_json(regexp_replace(s, a, x, 1)).b#220]\r\n+- *(1) LocalTableScan [s#218]\r\n```\r\nthe

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41475 . It's risky to use `transformUpWithNewOutput` with existing attribute ids. If the plan contains duplicated attribute ids somewhere, then we will hit conflicting attributes and an assertion error will be thrown by `QueryPlan#transformUpWithNewOutput`. \r\n\r\nThis PR takes a different approach. We canonicalize the plan first and then remove the alias-only project. Then we don't need `transformUpWithNewOutput` anymore as all attribute ids are normalized in the canonicalized plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix potential bugs\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n- Share the namespaces for `to_timestamp_ntz`, `to_timestamp_ltz` and `to_unix_timestamp` in Spark Connect. They were missed.\r\n- Adds the support of `TimestampNTZ` for literal handling in Python Spark Connect (by respecting `spark.sql.timestampType`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor feature parity, and respect timestamp ntz in resampling in pandas API on Spark\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this virtually fixes the same bug: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42392 in Spark Connect with Python.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests reenabled.","created_at":"2023-08-11T02:33:17Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:20Z","closed_at":"2023-08-11T09:35:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1401c80a93e213b514ba44857987ca1cc8c90b5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a displayOrder variable to WebUITab to specify the order in which tabs appear. Currently, the tabs are ordered by when they get attached, which isn't always desired. The default is MIN_VALUE, meaning if it's not specified, it will appear in the order added before any tabs with a non-default displayOrder. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese changes allow control over the order which tabs appear in the UI. Currently, the tabs are ordered by when they get attached, but this doesn't always match the desired order. For example, we would like to have the SQL Tab appear before the Connect tab; however, based on the code flow, the Connect tab will be attached first and with the current logic, that tab would also appear first.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, minor user-facing change affecting the order in which tabs appear in the Spark UI\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1696\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 3 54 26 PM\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark Connect has the following types of integration tests:\r\n* Client unit tests with a mock in process server (DummySparkConnectService with GRPC InProcessServerBuilder)\r\n* Client unit tests with a mock RPC server (DummySparkConnectService with GRPC NettyServerBuilder)\r\n* Server unit tests with in-process server and using various mocks\r\n* E2E tests of real client with a server started in another process (using RemoteSparkSession)\r\n\r\nWhat is lacking are E2E tests with an in-process Server (so that server state can be inspected asserted), and a real RPC client. This is impossible, because classes from `spark-connect-client-jvm` module include the client API which duplicates Spark SQL APIs of SparkSession, Dataset etc. When trying to pull a real client into the server module for testing, these classes clash.\r\n\r\nMove the `org.apache.spark.sql.connect.client` code into new `spark-connect-client-jvm-internal` module, so that the internal SparkConnectClient code is separated from the client public API, and can be pulled into testing of the server.\r\n\r\nTried alternative approach in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42465. That works, but it's a hack.\r\nTried alterantive approach to depend on a shaded/relocated version of client in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42461, but it's not possible to get that working.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor being able to use the internal client for testing of in-process server with an in-process client, but communicating over real RPC.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll modules test and build.\r\nI looked if more tests could be moved into jvm-internal, but most tests in the org.apache.spark.sql.client packages depend on the full client APIs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis provides an API to customize the `ProcessBuilder` instances used to launch SparkR and PySpark workers. This allows dynamic overrides of the command, environment variables, and the standard output stream.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nspark.worker.plugins: package.MyWorkerPlugin\r\n```\r\n```java\r\nclass MyWorkerPlugin implements SparkWorkerPlugin {\r\n\r\n  public void apply(ProcessBuilder pb) {\r\n    // Example use cases:\r\n    // pb.environment() to set environment variables\r\n    // pb.command(\"...\") to override the executed command\r\n    // pb.getInputStream() to do things with the worker's stdout\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a new API is needed to express customizations that cannot be expressed using static configs or environment variables (`spark.pyspark.python` or `spark.executorEnv.*`).\r\n\r\nAs described in SPARK-44767, this came up for us when using conda-packs and `spark.archives`. On drivers, packs are unarchived into `driverTmpDir` which has a dynamic name. That means we can't point to the driver-side environment statically in `PATH` or `PYTHONPATH` environment variables.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nDevelopers have a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSimplify retries of ReleaseExecute in ExecutePlanResponseReattachableIterator.\r\nInstead of chaining asynchronous calls, use the common retry loop logic from the asynchronous onError after first error.\r\nThis allows to reuse the common `retry` function instead of having to duplicate\r\n```\r\n        case NonFatal(e) if retryPolicy.canRetry(e) && currentRetryNum < retryPolicy.maxRetries =>\r\n          Thread.sleep(\r\n            (retryPolicy.maxBackoff min retryPolicy.initialBackoff * Math\r\n              .pow(retryPolicy.backoffMultiplier, currentRetryNum)).toMillis)\r\n```\r\nlogic.\r\n\r\nThis also brings this retries to be more similar to how it is in the python client.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCode simplification.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nChecked retries by printing `new Exception().printStackTrace` from the handler:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.Exception\r\n        at

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe following query works on branch-3.5 or below, but fails on the latest master:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect concat(DATE'2020-12-31', ' ', date_format('09:03:08', 'HH:mm:ss')) + (INTERVAL '03' HOUR)\r\n```\r\n \r\nThe direct reason is now we mark `cast(date as string)` as resolved during type coercion after changes https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42089. As a result, there are two transforms from CombinedTypeCoercionRule\r\n```\r\nRule ConcatCoercion Transformed\r\nconcat(2020-12-31,  , date_format(cast(09:03:08 as timestamp), HH:mm:ss, Some(America/Los_Angeles)))\r\nto\r\nconcat(cast(2020-12-31 as string),  , date_format(cast(09:03:08 as timestamp), HH:mm:ss, Some(America/Los_Angeles)))\r\n\r\nRule PromoteStrings Transformed\r\n(concat(cast(2020-12-31 as string),  , date_format(cast(09:03:08 as timestamp), HH:mm:ss, Some(America/Los_Angeles))) + INTERVAL '03' HOUR)\r\nto\r\n(cast(concat(cast(2020-12-31 as string),  , date_format(cast(09:03:08 as timestamp), HH:mm:ss, Some(America/Los_Angeles))) as double) + INTERVAL '03' HOUR)\r\n```  \r\nIn previous releases, the second transform doesn't happen since `cast(2020-12-31 as string)`  was considered unresolved after the first transform. With rules `ResolveTimeZone` and `ResolveBinaryArithmetic`, the `Add` becomes `TimeAdd` before it is transformed by `CombinedTypeCoercionRule` again.\r\n \r\nThe fix is simple, the analyzer should not promote string as double in binary arithmetic with ANSI interval. The changes in [https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42089](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42089.) are valid and we should keep it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend the rules of `primaryExpression` in `SqlBaseParser.g4`, and one more function `TIMEDIFF` which accepts 3-args in the same way as the existing expressions `TIMESTAMPDIFF`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo achieve feature parity w/ other system and make the migration to Spark SQL from such systems easier:\r\n1. Snowflake: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/timediff\r\n2. MySQL/MariaDB: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_timediff\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in `RetryingBlockTransferor` that happens when retry initiation has failed.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, the callers of `RetryingBlockTransfeathror#initiateRetry()` will catch any error and invoke the parent listener's exception handler.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is needed to prevent an edge case where retry initiation fails and executor gets stuck.\r\n\r\nMore details in SPARK-44756\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new test case in `RetryingBlockTransferorSuite` that simulates the problematic scenario.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"772\" alt=\"image\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMy last PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41052 causes AVRO read performance regression since I change the code structure. I turn one match case into a nested match case. So I fix the Avro data type conversion issues in anther way to avoid this regression.\r\n\r\nOriginal Change: \r\nWe introduce the SQLConf `spark.sql.legacy.avro.allowReadingWithIncompatibleSchema` to prevent reading interval types as date or timestamp types to avoid getting corrupt dates as well as reading decimal types with incorrect precision.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe found the following issues with open source Avro:\r\n\r\n- Interval types can be read as date or timestamp types that would lead to wildly different results\r\n   For example,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSparkConnectExecutionManager tracks all executions (ExecuteHolder) in all sessions of Spark Connect. It tracks which executions have RPCs (ExecuteGrpcReponseSender) attached to them. If an execution gets abandoned (it's not cleared with ReleaseExecute by the client, but no new RPC arrives), it will be automatically interrupted and removed after a timeout.  \r\n\r\nNote for the failure:\r\n```\r\nError: Field \"2\" on message \"ReleaseExecuteResponse\" moved from outside to inside a oneof.\r\nError: buf found 1 breaking changes.\r\n```\r\nThe message ReleaseExecuteResponse has not been released yet, so it's not a breaking change compared to any released version.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNeed the SparkConnectExecutionManager to track reattachable executions that got abandoned by client.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPending, but the SparkConnectExecutionManager allows tests to inspect execution state, so allows writing more unit tests about reattachable

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42020).\r\n\r\nIt should be supported in Python UDTF.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, named arguments will be available for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements query execution support for for the PARTITION BY and ORDER BY clauses for UDTF TABLE arguments.\r\n\r\n* The query planning support was added in [1] and [2] and [3]. After those changes, the planner added a projection to compute the PARTITION BY expressions, plus a repartition operator, plus a sort operator.\r\n* In this PR, the Python executor receives the indexes of these expressions within the input table's rows, and compares the values of the projected partitioning expressions between consecutive rows.\r\n* When the values change, this marks the boundary between partitions, and so we call the UDTF instance's `terminate` method, then destroy it and create a new one for the next partition.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42100\r\n[2] https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42174\r\n[3] https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42351\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Make a test UDTF to yield an output row with the same value\r\n# consumed from the last input row in the input table or partition.\r\nclass TestUDTF:\r\n    def eval(self, row: Row):\r\n\tself._last = row['input']\r\n\tself._partition_col = row['partition_col']\r\n\r\n    def terminate(self):\r\n\tyield self._partition_col, self._last\r\n\r\nfunc = udtf(TestUDTF, returnType='partition_col: int, last: int')\r\nself.spark.udtf.register('test_udtf', func)\r\nself.spark.sql('''\r\n    WITH t AS (\r\n        SELECT id AS partition_col, 1 AS input FROM range(0, 2) UNION ALL\r\n        SELECT id AS partition_col, 2 AS input FROM range(0, 2)\r\n    )\r\n    SELECT *\r\n    FROM test_udtf(TABLE(t) PARTITION BY partition_col ORDER BY input)\r\n    ''').collect()\r\n\r\n> [Row(partition_col=0, last=2), (partition_col=1, last=2)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis brings full end-to-end execution for the PARTITION BY and/or ORDER BY clauses for UDTF TABLE arguments.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds end-to-end testing in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a couple methods to SparkSession.Builder:\r\n- `conf` - this group of methods allows you to set runtime configurations on the Spark Connect Session.\r\n- `master` - this is a no-op, it is only added for compatibility.\r\n- `appName` - this is a no-op, it is only added for compatibility.\r\n- `enableHiveSupport ` - this is a no-op, it is only added for compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to maximize compatiblity with the existing API in sql/core.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It adds a couple of builder methods.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd tests to `SparkSessionSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdding additional option in StatsdSink to allow passing regex as a filter option for reporting metrics\r\nAdded unit test case to validate the application of filter in the StatsdSink\r\nUpdated metrics config to represent the added config for StatsdSink\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the current state Spark metrics instances send a large range of metrics that are useful for debugging and performance analysis. There are cases where the consumers would like to switch between deeper metrics and only specific custom metrics that are required for system maintenance. This option introduced in StatsdSink extends the existing filtering option in the reporter and exposes the same as an option. This implementation is similar to GraphiteSink that supports a similar feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes , This PR exposes an additional config that users can provide optionally to filter the metrics that are being reported. This is a optional field and defaulted to the existing behaviour where the sink reports all the metrics.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests has been added in the PR to validate the change\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-09T17:19:02Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T14:07:32Z","closed_at":"2023-08-10T14:07:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fb341cd333b584998abb5ff8711ef20dfbb9e6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7dd56e69cf817bed40b0bfe50505775106ec403f","head":{"label":"ramesh-muthusamy:SPARK-44741","ref":"SPARK-44741","sha":"7dd56e69cf817bed40b0bfe50505775106ec403f","user":{"login":"ramesh-muthusamy","id":8124479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjQ0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8124479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy","html_url":"https://github.com/ramesh-muthusamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":313730714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTM3MzA3MTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"ramesh-muthusamy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ramesh-muthusamy","id":8124479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjQ0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8124479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy","html_url":"https://github.com/ramesh-muthusamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramesh-muthusamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ramesh-muthusamy/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nafter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42375, the `pyspark-connect` in 3.5 daily GA still fails (see

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41475 . It's risky to use `transformUpWithNewOutput` with existing attribute ids. If the plan contains duplicated attribute ids somewhere, then we will hit conflicting attributes and an assertion error will be thrown by `QueryPlan#transformUpWithNewOutput`. \r\n\r\nThis PR takes a different approach. We canonicalize the plan first and then remove the alias-only project. Then we don't need `transformUpWithNewOutput` anymore as all attribute ids are normalized in the canonicalized plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix potential bugs\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix the bug in issue [SPARK-44581](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44581)\r\n\r\n**Bug:**\r\nIn spark3.2 it throws the org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException, but in spark2.4 this hook does not throw exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nI rebuild the hadoop-client-api.jar, and add some debug log before the hadoop shutdown hook is created, and rebuild the spark-yarn.jar to add some debug log when creating the spark shutdown hook manager, here is the screenshot of the log: \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/62563545/ea338db3-646c-432c-bf16-1f445adc2ad9)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see from the screenshot, the ShutdownHookManager is initialized before the ApplicationManager create a new ugi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reason**\r\n\r\nThe main cause is that ShutdownHook thread is created before we create the ugi in ApplicationMaster.\r\n\r\nWhen we set the config key \"hadoop.security.credential.provider.path\", the ApplicationMaster will try to get a filesystem when generating SSLOptions, and when initialize the filesystem during which it will generate a new thread whose ugi is inherited from the current process (yarn).\r\nAfter this, it will generate a new ugi (SPARK_USER) in ApplicationMaster and execute the doAs() function.\r\n\r\nHere is the chain of the call:\r\nApplicationMaster.(ApplicationMaster.scala:83) -> org.apache.spark.SecurityManager.(SecurityManager.scala:98) -> org.apache.spark.SSLOptions$.parse(SSLOptions.scala:188) -> org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.getPassword(Configuration.java:2353) -> org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.getPasswordFromCredentialProviders(Configuration.java:2434) -> org.apache.hadoop.security.alias.CredentialProviderFactory.getProviders(CredentialProviderFactory.java:82)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI didn't add new UnitTest for this, but I rebuild the package, and runs a program in my cluster, and turns out that the user when I delete the staging file turns to be the same with the SPARK_USER.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-09T03:01:13Z","updated_at":"2023-08-21T10:53:31Z","closed_at":"2023-08-09T05:47:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3588545c12124424c8484407b82342e63d217f66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42405/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42405/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42405/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d59c8b38450ad85562d420e397523b61a2024c2b","head":{"label":"liangyu-1:SPARK-44581","ref":"SPARK-44581","sha":"d59c8b38450ad85562d420e397523b61a2024c2b","user":{"login":"liangyu-1","id":62563545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTYzNTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62563545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1","html_url":"https://github.com/liangyu-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":667729839,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ8y_rw","name":"spark","full_name":"liangyu-1/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liangyu-1","id":62563545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTYzNTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62563545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1","html_url":"https://github.com/liangyu-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liangyu-1/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nClarify the DRA enabling conditions in docs and error message. (no \\n actually)\r\n\r\n```\r\nDynamic allocation of executors requires one of the following conditions:\r\n1) enabling external shuffle service through spark.shuffle.service.enabled.\r\n2) enabling shuffle tracking through spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.enabled.\r\n3) enabling shuffle blocks decommission through spark.decommission.enabled and spark.storage.decommission.shuffleBlocks.enabled.\r\n4) (Experimental) configuring spark.shuffle.sort.io.plugin.class to use a custom ShuffleDataIO who's ShuffleDriverComponents supports reliable storage.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, ESS is not the only way to support DRA, but users always see the misleading error message when it does not meet the DRA conditions\r\n```\r\nDynamic allocation of executors requires the external shuffle service. You may enable this\r\nthrough spark.shuffle.service.enabled.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is misleading, especially for users who want to enable DRA in Spark on K8s cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nReview.","created_at":"2023-08-08T22:00:19Z","updated_at":"2023-08-11T07:10:27Z","closed_at":"2023-08-11T07:09:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a3c9fb05600a8e047b49bbc180a9e3d548a39d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42404/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42404/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42404/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/da965f6fe391a2cafa3539857ce81a35dd7837de","head":{"label":"pan3793:SPARK-44727","ref":"SPARK-44727","sha":"da965f6fe391a2cafa3539857ce81a35dd7837de","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275650396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU2NTAzOTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"pan3793/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve `HeartbeatReceiver` to give a clear directional message for Apache Spark 4.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

`spark.storage.blockManagerHeartbeatTimeoutMs` which the users never have in their Spark jobs.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell -c

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange retry logic. For existing retry logic the maximum allowed wait time can be extremely low and even zero with small probability.\r\n\r\nThis happens, because it waits random(0, T) for T in exponentialBackoff(). Revamp the logic to guarantee the minimum wait time of 10 minutes. Also synchronize retry behavior among python and scala.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis avoids certain class of client errors where client simply doesn't wait long enough.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nChanges are small from user perspective. The retries are running longer and smoother.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, if the creation side of runtime filter could be broadcasted, Spark will not inject a bloom filter or `InSunquery` filter into the application side. I think at first we thought broadcast was cheaper than submit a new job for runtime filter. This behavior is contrary to the join has a shuffle below broadcast hash join described in the design document.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/194822331-7a36b018-dfd9-48ce-a867-7c30a6914791.png)\r\n\r\nIn fact, we just need the creation side is small enough and inject bloom filter which could reuse the broadcast exchange and improve performance.\r\n\r\nAs we know, bloom filter ensures creation side is small enough with the code below.\r\n```\r\n    // Skip if the filter creation side is too big\r\n    if (filterCreationSidePlan.stats.sizeInBytes > conf.runtimeFilterCreationSideThreshold) {\r\n      return filterApplicationSidePlan\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n`InSunquery` filter ensures creation side is small enough with the code below.\r\n```\r\n    val aggregate = Aggregate(Seq(alias), Seq(alias), filterCreationSidePlan)\r\n    if (!canBroadcastBySize(aggregate, conf)) {\r\n      // Skip the InSubquery filter if the size of `aggregate` is beyond broadcast join threshold,\r\n      // i.e., the semi-join will be a shuffled join, which is not worthwhile.\r\n      return filterApplicationSidePlan\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, we can support below scenes.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/212868325-154d21ee-cfc1-4e6c-a27a-a4fd3908e029.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Query Performance Benchmarks: TPC-DS Performance Evaluation**\r\nHere are the test cases this PR can trigger the runtime filter. This PR is useful for large queries.\r\nThe tpcds data size is 3TB.\r\nOpen AQE(Default)\r\n| TPC-DS Query   | Default(Seconds)  | After(Seconds)  | Speedup(Percent)  |\r\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\r\n| q14a | 169.103 | 166.837 | 1% |\r\n| q14b | 162.32 | 162.40 | 0% |\r\n| q23a | 169.103 | 166.837 | 1% |\r\n| q23b | 596.88 | 596.65 | 0% |\r\n| q24a | 430.36 | 427.85 | 1% |\r\n| q24b | 427.37 | 407.36 | 5% |\r\n| q50 | 179.97 | 171.96 | 5% |\r\n| q64 | 195.88 | 196.83 | 0% |\r\n| q67 | 1,244.59 | 1,172.70 | 6% |\r\n| q75 | 102.48 | 109.66 | -7% |\r\n| q78 | 236.50 | 236.15 | 0% |\r\n| q93 | 338.32 | 328.83 | 3% |\r\n| q95 | 192.69 | 186.25 | 3% |\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Relax the restrictions of broadcast join on bloom filter, so as the runtime filter applicable to more scenarios.\r\n2. Reuse the broadcast exchange for bloom filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSet the column vector default memory mode to depend on the off-heap memory mode flag. This is to prevent a user from using Vectorized-Reader with an on-heap column-vector by default when the off-heap memory mode is enabled on the cluster.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid the unintentional usage of on-heap memory in vectorized-reader when off-heap memory mode is enabled by the user.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual & existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to raise an error when an user uses V1 `INSERT` without a list of columns, and the number of inserting columns doesn't match to the number of actual table columns.\r\n\r\nAt the moment Spark inserts data successfully in such case after the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41262 which changed the behaviour of Spark 3.4.x.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To conform the SQL standard which requires the number of columns must be the same:\r\n![Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 11 01 27 AM](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/1580697/c55badec-5716-490f-a83a-0bb6b22c84c7)\r\n\r\nApparently, the insertion below must not succeed:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> CREATE TABLE tabtest(c1 INT, c2 INT);\r\nspark-sql (default)> INSERT INTO tabtest SELECT 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. To have the same behaviour as **Spark 3.4**:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> INSERT INTO tabtest SELECT 1;\r\n`spark_catalog`.`default`.`tabtest` requires that the data to be inserted have the same number of columns as the target table: target table has 2 column(s) but the inserted data has 1 column(s), including 0 partition column(s) having constant value(s).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nAfter the changes:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> INSERT INTO tabtest SELECT 1;\r\n[INSERT_COLUMN_ARITY_MISMATCH.NOT_ENOUGH_DATA_COLUMNS] Cannot write to `spark_catalog`.`default`.`tabtest`, the reason is not enough data columns:\r\nTable columns: `c1`, `c2`.\r\nData columns: `1`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *InsertSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ResolveDefaultColumnsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to respect `TimestampNTZ` type in resampling at pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt still operates as if the timestamps are `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` even when `spark.sql.timestampType` is set to `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`, which is unexpected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug so end users can use exactly same behaviour with pandas with `TimestampNTZType` - pandas does not respect the local timezone with DST. While we might need to follow this even for `TimestampType`, this PR does not address the case as it might be controversial.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest was added.","created_at":"2023-08-08T11:17:15Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:20Z","closed_at":"2023-08-09T02:03:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9c3c35ea4df80c3bdc5fd843eeef0fcebca23c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDeleting files on executor exit when migration is enabled\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. This will release extra disk space on the node reducing the failures due to disk running out of space\r\n2. If there is no shuffle data then YARN can decommission the node right away. Needs this other PR to be merged to expose this metric to YARN https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42071 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested manually. \r\nWill add unit tests once we get traction on this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds the `udf` (with a return type), and `callUDF` functions to `functions.scala` for the Spark Connect Scala Client.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want the Spark Connect Scala Client to be as compatible as possible with the existing sql/core APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It adds more exposed functions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `UserDefinedFunctionE2ETestSuite` and  `FunctionTestSuite`. I have also updated the compatibility checks.","created_at":"2023-08-08T03:17:46Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T13:42:16Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T13:42:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b0acf7d175b8743abcf81891b8ece0b5aebff5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e037ae5d42278c5f42540e26df33e04768db016c","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-44715","ref":"SPARK-44715","sha":"e037ae5d42278c5f42540e26df33e04768db016c","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

This multi-threading model is problematic and confusing as Spark's execution model within a task is commonly understood to be single-threaded.\r\nMore importantly, this departure of a double-threaded execution resulted in a series of customer issues involving [race conditions](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33277) and [deadlocks](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38677) between threads as the code was hard to reason about. There have been multiple attempts to reign in these issues, viz., [fix 1](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22535), [fix 2](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30177), [fix 3](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/243c321db2f02f6b4d926114bd37a6e74c2be185). Moreover, the fixes have made the code base somewhat abstruse by introducing multiple daemon [monitor threads](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a3a32912be04d3760cb34eb4b79d6d481bbec502/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/api/python/PythonRunner.scala#L579) to detect deadlocks. This PR makes PythonRunner single-threaded making it easier to reason about and improving code health.\r\n\r\n#### Current Execution Model in Spark for Python UDFs\r\nFor queries containing Python UDFs, the main Java task thread spins up a new writer thread to pipe data from the child Spark plan into the Python worker evaluating the UDF. The writer thread runs in a tight loop: evaluates the child Spark plan, and feeds the resulting output to the Python worker. The main task thread simultaneously consumes the Python UDF’s output and evaluates the parent Spark plan to produce the final result.\r\nThe I/O to/from the Python worker uses blocking Java Sockets necessitating the use of two threads, one responsible for input to the Python worker and the other for output. Without two threads, it is easy to run into a deadlock. For example, the task can block forever waiting for the output from the Python worker. The output will never arrive until the input is supplied to the Python worker, which is not possible as the task thread is blocked while waiting on output.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Fix\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is to move to the standard single-threaded execution model within a task, i.e., to do away with the writer thread. In addition to mitigating the crashes, the fix reduces the complexity of the existing code by doing away with many safety checks in place to track deadlocks in the double-threaded execution model.\r\n\r\nIn the new model, the main task thread alternates between consuming/feeding data to the Python worker using asynchronous I/O through Java’s [SocketChannel](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SocketChannel.html). See the `read()` method in the code below for approximately how this is achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase class PythonUDFRunner {\r\n\r\n  private var nextRow: Row = _\r\n  private var endOfStream = false\r\n  private var childHasNext = true\r\n  private var buffer: ByteBuffer = _\r\n\r\n  def hasNext(): Boolean = nextRow != null || {\r\n     if (!endOfStream) {\r\n       read(buffer)\r\n       nextRow = deserialize(buffer)\r\n       hasNext\r\n     } else {\r\n       false\r\n     }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  def next(): Row = {\r\n     if (hasNext) {\r\n       val outputRow = nextRow\r\n       nextRow = null\r\n       outputRow\r\n     } else {\r\n       null\r\n     }\r\n  }\r\n \r\n  def read(buf: Array[Byte]): Row = {\r\n    var n = 0\r\n    while (n == 0) {\r\n    // Alternate between reading/writing to the Python worker using async I/O\r\n    if (pythonWorker.isReadable) {\r\n      n = pythonWorker.read(buf)\r\n    }\r\n    if (pythonWorker.isWritable) {\r\n      consumeChildPlanAndWriteDataToPythonWorker()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  def consumeChildPlanAndWriteDataToPythonWorker(): Unit = {\r\n      // Tracks whether the connection to the Python worker can be written to. \r\n      var socketAcceptsInput = true\r\n      while (socketAcceptsInput && (childHasNext || buffer.hasRemaining)) {\r\n        if (!buffer.hasRemaining && childHasNext) {\r\n          // Consume data from the child and buffer it.\r\n          writeToBuffer(childPlan.next(), buffer)\r\n          childHasNext = childPlan.hasNext()\r\n          if (!childHasNext) {\r\n            // Exhausted child plan’s output.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe dataframe based spark-ml is still relying on RDD APIs to load metadata of the saved models, using `sc.textFile` instead of `spark.read.text`, and to save the model, using `saveAsTextFile` instead of `write.text`.\r\nI am proposing to refactor the code to pass a `SparkSession` instead of a `SparkContext` to the internal reader and writer classes, for scala, python and R-wrapper APIs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is more consistent to use dataframe-only APIs in the spark-ml module, that is supposed to use only dataframe APIs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe changes should affect only internal Loader classes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit-tests run successfully.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-07T19:03:38Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T00:19:19Z","closed_at":"2024-01-10T00:19:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfb1a3e9297f9cbe43a185dbae13b4471862433d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42382/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42382/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42382/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ac7e4f94bfd15c0707ec894dbb9bdc27f37663d5","head":{"label":"sergioschena-db:ml-read-with-dataframe-api","ref":"ml-read-with-dataframe-api","sha":"ac7e4f94bfd15c0707ec894dbb9bdc27f37663d5","user":{"login":"sergioschena-db","id":110540396,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpa2bA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110540396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db","html_url":"https://github.com/sergioschena-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":675641942,"node_id":"R_kgDOKEV6Vg","name":"spark","full_name":"sergioschena-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sergioschena-db","id":110540396,"node_id":"U_kgDOBpa2bA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110540396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db","html_url":"https://github.com/sergioschena-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sergioschena-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sergioschena-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a minor log change which aims to use `INFO`-level log instead of `WARN`-level in `ExecutorPodsWatcher.onClose` if `SparkContext` is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nLog eventLog rewrite duration when compact old event log files.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen enable `spark.eventLog.rolling.enabled` and the number of eventLog files exceeds the value of `spark.history.fs.eventLog.rolling.maxFilesToRetain`, HistoryServer will compact the old event log files into one compact file.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no log the rewrite duration in rewrite method, this metric is useful for understand the compact duration, so we need add logs in the method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Introduced the FetchErrorDetails RPC to retrieve comprehensive error details. FetchErrorDetails is used for enriching the error by issuing a separate RPC call based on the `errorId` field in the ErrorInfo. \r\n- Introduced error enrichment that utilizes an additional RPC to fetch untruncated exception messages and server-side stack traces. This enrichment can be enabled or disabled using the flag `spark.sql.connect.enrichError.enabled`, and it's true by default.\r\n- Implemented setting server-side stack traces for exceptions on the client side via FetchErrorDetails RPC for debugging. The feature is enabled or disabled using the flag `spark.sql.connect.serverStacktrace.enabled` and it's true by default\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n- Attaching full exception messages to the error details protobuf can quickly hit the 8K GRPC Netty header limit. Utilizing a separate RPC to fetch comprehensive error information is more dependable.\r\n- Providing server-side stack traces aids in effectively diagnosing server-related issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n- `build/sbt \"connect/testOnly *FetchErrorDetailsHandlerSuite\"`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to (mostly) refactor all the internal workarounds to get the active session correctly.\r\n\r\nThere are few things to note:\r\n\r\n- _PySpark without Spark Connect does not already support the hierarchy of active sessions_. With pinned thread mode (enabled by default), PySpark does map each Python thread to JVM thread, but the thread creation happens within gateway server, that does not respect the thread hierarchy. Therefore, this PR follows the exactly same behaviour.\r\n  - New thread will not have an active thread by default.\r\n  - Other behaviours are same as PySpark without Connect, see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42367\r\n- Since I am here, I piggiyback few documentation changes. We missed document `SparkSession.readStream`, `SparkSession.streams`, `SparkSession.udtf`, `SparkSession.conf` and `SparkSession.version` in Spark Connect.\r\n- The changes here are mostly refactoring that reuses existing unittests while I expose two methods:\r\n  - `SparkSession.getActiveSession` (only for Spark Connect)\r\n  - `SparkSession.active` (for both in PySpark)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor Spark Connect users to be able to play with active and default sessions in Python.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds new API:\r\n  - `SparkSession.getActiveSession` (only for Spark Connect)\r\n  - `SparkSession.active` (for both in PySpark)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unittests should cover all.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-07T04:50:38Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:21Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T02:03:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"93394d851b842227183450a4c4f4bf093bf71de3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `commons-lang3` 3.13.0, `RandomUtils` has been marked as `@Deprecated`, the Java doc of `commons-lang3` suggests to instead use the api of

only uses `RandomUtils` in test code, so this pr attempts to replace `RandomUtils` with `ThreadLocalRandom` to avoid introducing additional third-party dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds the `default` and `active` session variables to `SparkSession`:\r\n- `default` session is global value. It is typically the first session created through `getOrCreate`. It can be changed through `set` or `clear`. If the session is closed and it is the `default` session we clear the `default` session.\r\n- `active` session is a thread local value. It is typically the first session created in this thread or it inherits is value from its parent thread. It can be changed through `set` or `clear`, please note that these methods operate thread locally, so they won't change the parent or children. If the session is closed and it is the `active` session for the current thread then we clear the active value (only for the current thread!).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo increase compatibility with the existing SparkSession API in `sql/core`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It adds a couple methods that were missing from the Scala Client.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `SparkSessionSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-07T02:06:31Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T10:59:12Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T02:15:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2734239dcd6e8d645b01a4bc6f717e00a41f8e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42367/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42367/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42367/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d1069d8790d04109c34c2932c844f2956b26bc23","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-43429","ref":"SPARK-43429","sha":"d1069d8790d04109c34c2932c844f2956b26bc23","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is currently not possible to create a `RowEncoder` using public API. The internal APIs for this will change in Spark 3.5, this means that library maintainers have to update their code if they use a RowEncoder. To avoid happening again, we add this method to the public API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It adds the `row` method to `Encoders`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to connect and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check that `DEFAULT` clause contains a parameter. If so, raise appropriate error about the feature is not supported. Currently, table creation with `DEFAULT` containing any parameters finishes successfully even parameters are not supported in such case:\r\n```sql\r\nscala>  spark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE t12(c1 int default :parm)\", args = Map(\"parm\" -> 5)).show()\r\n++\r\n||\r\n++\r\n++\r\nscala>  spark.sql(\"describe t12\");\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [INVALID_DEFAULT_VALUE.UNRESOLVED_EXPRESSION] Failed to execute EXISTS_DEFAULT command because the destination table column `c1` has a DEFAULT value :parm, which fails to resolve as a valid expression.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis improves user experience with Spark SQL by saying about the root cause of the issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the change, the table creation completes w/ the error:\r\n```sql\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE t12(c1 int default :parm)\", args = Map(\"parm\" -> 5)).show()\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\n[UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.PARAMETER_MARKER_IN_UNEXPECTED_STATEMENT] The feature is not supported: Parameter markers are not allowed in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe aim of this PR is to downgrade the Scala 2.13 dependency in `Apache Spark 3.5` to 2.13.8, to ensure that `Apache Spark 3.5` behaves the same as `Apache Spark 3.4.x` in terms of Maven build and testing: it can be build with `-target:jvm-1.8`, and tested with Java 11/17.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs reported in SPARK-44376, there are issues when maven build and test using Java 11/17 with `-target:jvm-1.8`:\r\n\r\n- run `build/mvn clean install -Pscala-2.13` with Java 17\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] ---

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR changes the exception handling in the `unpackScalarScalaUD` function in `SparkConnectPlanner` from determining the exception type based on a fixed nesting level to using Guava `Throwables` to get the root cause and then determining the type of the root cause. This makes it compatible with differences between different Java versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe following failure occurred when testing `UDFClassLoadingE2ESuite` in Java 17 daily test:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/5766913899/job/15635782831\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] UDFClassLoadingE2ESuite:\r\n[info] - update class loader after stubbing: new session

for example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ncase e: IOException if e.getCause.isInstanceOf[NoSuchMethodException] =>\r\n  throw new ClassNotFoundException(... ${e.getCause} ...)\r\ncase e: RuntimeException\r\n    if e.getCause != null && e.getCause.getCause.isInstanceOf[NoSuchMethodException] =>\r\n  throw new ClassNotFoundException(... ${e.getCause.getCause} ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if future Java versions change the nested levels of exceptions again, this will necessitate another modification of this part of the code. Therefore, this PR has been revised to fetch the root cause of the exception and conduct a type check on the root cause to make it as universal as possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

For resources specified with glob, we will rely on existing implementation using `globStatus` to obtain `fileStatus`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's inefficient to obtain FileStatus for each resource [one by one](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/531ec8bddc8dd22ca39486dbdd31e62e989ddc15/resource-managers/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/ClientDistributedCacheManager.scala#L71C1). In our company setting, we are running Spark with Hadoop Yarn and HDFS. We noticed the current behavior has two major drawbacks:\r\n\r\n- Since each getFileStatus call involves network delays, the overall delay can be large and add uncertainty to the overall Spark job runtime. Specifically, we quantify this overhead within our cluster. We see the p50 overhead is around 10s, p80 is 1 min, and p100 is up to 15 mins. When HDFS is overloaded, the delays become more severe. \r\n\r\n- In our cluster, we have nearly 100 million getFileStatus call to HDFS daily. We noticed that in our cluster, most resources come from the same HDFS directory for each user (See our [engineer blog post](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/reducing-apache-spark-application-dependencies-upload-by-99-) about why we took this approach). Therefore, we can greatly reduce nearly 100 million getFileStatus call to 0.1 million `listStatus` calls daily. This will further reduce overhead from the HDFS side. \r\n\r\nAll in all, a more efficient way to fetch the FileStatus for each resource is highly needed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nWe introduce two configurations so that the user can turn on this feature\r\n\r\n1. `spark.yarn.client.statCache.preloaded.enabled`: This configuration enables statCache to be preloaded at YARN client side. This feature analyzes the pattern of resource paths. If multiple resources shared the same parent directory, a single `listStatus` will be invoked on the parent directory instead of multiple `getFileStatus` performed on each individual resource. If most resources are from the same directory, this feature greatly reduces the RPC call, reduces job runtime, and improve the job runtime variation due to network delays. Noticing, this could potentially increase the memory overhead at client side.\r\n2. `spark.yarn.client.statCache.preloaded.perDirectoryThreshold`: This configuration defines the threshold for the number of resources in a directory that triggers the activation of the statCache preloading. When the count of individual resources specified by `spark.yarn.jars` within a directory is no less than this threshold, the statCache preloading for that directory will be activated. It's\" important to note that this configuration will only take effect when the above option is enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf executePlan / reattachExecute handling is done directly on the GRPC thread, flow control OnReady events are getting queued until after the handler returns, so OnReadyHandler never gets notified until after the handler exits.\r\nThe correct way to use it is for the handler to delegate work to another thread and exit. See https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/7361\r\n\r\nTidied up and added a lot of logging and statistics to ExecuteGrpcResponseSender and ExecuteResponseObserver to be able to observe this behaviour.\r\n\r\nFollowup work in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44625 is needed for cleanup of abandoned executions that will also make sure that these threads are joined.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExecuteGrpcResponseSender gets stuck waiting on grpcCallObserverReadySignal because events from OnReadyHandler do not arrive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded extensive debugging to ExecuteGrpcResponseSender and ExecuteResponseObserver and tested and observer the behaviour of all the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe logging level is passed into RocksDB in a correct way. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe pass log4j's log level to RocksDB so that RocksDB debug log can go to log4j. However, we pass in log level after we create the logger. However, the way it is set isn't effective. This has two impacts: (1) setting DEBUG level don't make RocksDB generate DEBUG level logs; (2) setting WARN or ERROR level does prevent INFO level logging, but RocksDB still makes JNI calls to Scala, which is an unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually change the log level and observe the log lines in unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-05T00:40:15Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T02:12:08Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T02:12:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce42d3e73091267d73dcf48e649288a84380d791","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED
