This is being transformed somehow into an IP numeric address\r\nand is failing endpoint verification.  The test passes on my Windows machine\r\nand also passes on Mac and Ubuntu when I run it there.  I'm\r\nadding the \"localhost\" IP address to the certificate to get past this.\r\nAnother fix would be to change the Rule that's using \"localhost\" to\r\nuse the real host name but that would affect a lot of other tests.\r\n\r\nBefore I started messing with this test it was adding\r\nInetAddress.getLocalHost() as an IP address to the certificate so I\r\ndon't think this is a big change to the original test.  The test now\r\nuses LocalHostUtils.getLocalHost() to get an IP to add to the\r\ncertificate, which is the correct \"localhost\" to use with Geode.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Introduce a Geode parameter - `redis-enabled` which is `false` by default. This parameter determines whether the service is started or not.\r\n- Set the default `redis-port` value to `6379`\r\n- `redis-port` range is 0..65535\r\n- When `redis-port=0`, and `redis-enabled=true` the service will start on an ephemeral port.\r\n- When `gfsh` is used with `--redis-port`, `--redis-password`, or `--redis-bind-address`, it should automatically set `redis-enabled=true`\r\n\r\n`gemfire_properties.html.md.erb` updated as part of this PR:

you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [N/A] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [N/A] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, check Concourse for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible. If you need help, please send an\r\nemail to dev@geode.apache.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the changes touch a huge number of files, the PR has been broken up into chunks to allow easier reviewing.\r\n\r\nTo verify that all changes are correct and that no instances of \"/\" in region names/paths have been missed, I replaced the character in GeodePublicGlossary with a \"~\", updated oql.g to allow queries to be correctly parsed using the new character, and ran all tests. All failing tests were either directly comparing the region separator to \"/\", creating caches from XML containing regions/indexes using \"/\" or involved older client/server versions which would not be compatible with the changed separator.","created_at":"2020-05-17T22:52:50Z","updated_at":"2020-05-21T16:45:17Z","closed_at":"2020-05-21T16:45:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3bc774c2c6c7b9c513697dc3ec85b697947a602","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/63a76af299c42342221036bf7151b90c4f2b6721","head":{"label":"DonalEvans:UseRegionSEPARATOR2","ref":"UseRegionSEPARATOR2","sha":"63a76af299c42342221036bf7151b90c4f2b6721","user":{"login":"DonalEvans","id":17314657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzE0NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17314657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans","html_url":"https://github.com/DonalEvans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":200111776,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDAxMTE3NzY=","name":"geode","full_name":"DonalEvans/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DonalEvans","id":17314657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzE0NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17314657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans","html_url":"https://github.com/DonalEvans","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DonalEvans/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DonalEvans/geode","description":"Apache

replaced replicated metaRegion with a partitioned dataRegion\r\nCurrently the dataRegion is used the same way as the metaRegion\r\nexcept for sets and hashes which store their actual data in it.\r\n* Exception handling now correctly deals with FunctionException\r\n* Disabled a test until GEODE-8127 if fixed.\r\n* now uses the ByteArrayWrapper as the key on the meta region\r\nand the locks map instead of using a String.\r\nSince a ByteArrayWrapper is used as the key in the data region\r\nthis will end up saving memory.\r\n\r\n* Found a problem with redis dynamic region management.\r\nSome of the code was executing when we added a new set or hash to\r\nthe metaDataRegion. It was only ignoring STRING and HLL.\r\nThis caused some extra memory to be used for every redis set/hash.\r\nNow the dynamic region code is only used for lists and sortedSet.\r\n\r\n* This commit has some TODO comments of what looks like a bug in\r\nthe dynamic region code when a new server is started. It looks\r\nlike the new server will not create already existing dynamic regions.\r\nWe could test this by starting one server, create a LIST, then\r\nstart another server, and then shutdown the first server. Does\r\nthe LIST still exist? If we change them not to use dynamic regions\r\nthen this issue will go away.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
