We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>\n<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>\n<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>\n<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>\n<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Client</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>. When a <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> succeeds, React will automatically reset the form for uncontrolled components. The form can be reset manually with the new <code>requestFormReset</code> API.</li>\n<li><code>&lt;button&gt; and &lt;input&gt; formAction</code> prop: Actions can be passed to the <code>formAction</code> prop to configure form submission behavior. This allows using different Actions depending on the input.</li>\n<li><code>useFormStatus</code>: is a new hook that provides the status of the parent <code>&lt;form&gt; action</code>, as if the form was a Context provider. The hook returns the values: <code>pending</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>method</code>, and <code>action</code>.</li>\n<li>Support for Document Metadata: We’ve added support for rendering document metadata tags in components natively. React will automatically hoist them into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document.</li>\n<li>Support for Stylesheets: React 19 will ensure stylesheets are inserted into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> on the client before revealing the content of a Suspense boundary that depends on that stylesheet.</li>\n<li>Support for async scripts: Async scripts can be rendered anywhere in the component tree and React will handle ordering and deduplication.</li>\n<li>Support for preloading resources: React 19 ships with <code>preinit</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetchDNS</code>, and <code>preconnect</code> APIs to optimize initial page loads by moving discovery of additional resources like fonts out of stylesheet loading. They can also be used to prefetch resources used by an anticipated navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React DOM Server</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added <code>prerender</code> and <code>prerenderToNodeStream</code> APIs for static site generation. They are designed to work with streaming environments like Node.js Streams and Web Streams. Unlike <code>renderToString</code>, they wait for data to load for HTML generation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React Server Components</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>RSC features such as directives, server components, and server functions are now stable. This means libraries that ship with Server Components can now target React 19 as a peer dependency with a react-server export condition for use in frameworks that support the Full-stack React Architecture. The underlying APIs used to implement a React Server Components bundler or framework do not follow semver and may break between minors in React 19.x. See <a href=\"https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components\">docs</a> for how to support React Server Components.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated: <code>element.ref</code> access: React 19 supports ref as a prop, so we’re deprecating <code>element.ref</code> in favor of <code>element.props.ref</code>. Accessing will result in a warning.</li>\n<li><code>react-test-renderer</code>: In React 19, react-test-renderer logs a deprecation warning and has switched to concurrent rendering for web usage. We recommend migrating your tests to  <a href=\"https://github.com/testinglibrary\"><code>@​testinglibrary</code></a>.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) or <a href=\"https://github.com/testingesting-library\"><code>@​testingesting-library</code></a>.com/docs/react-native-testing-library/intro)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>React 19 brings in a number of breaking changes, including the removals of long-deprecated APIs.

Errors that are caught by an Error Boundary are reported to console.error. We’ve introduced <code>onUncaughtError</code> and <code>onCaughtError</code> methods to <code>createRoot</code> and <code>hydrateRoot</code> to customize this error handling.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>propTypes</code>: Using <code>propTypes</code> will now be silently ignored. If required, we recommend migrating to TypeScript or another type-checking solution.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>defaultProps</code> for functions: ES6 default parameters can be used in place. Class components continue to support <code>defaultProps</code> since there is no ES6 alternative.</li>\n<li>Removed: <code>contextTypes</code> and <code>getChildContext</code>: Legacy Context for class components has been removed in favor of the <code>contextType</code> API.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Read <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19\">React 19 release post</a> and <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">React 19 upgrade guide</a> for more information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: To help make the upgrade to React 19 easier, we’ve published a react@18.3 release that is identical to 18.2 but adds warnings for deprecated APIs and other changes that are needed for React 19. We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<h3>React</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>\n<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state.

Read <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19\">React 19 release post</a> and <a href=\"https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19-upgrade-guide\">React 19 upgrade guide</a> for more information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note: To help make the upgrade to React 19 easier, we’ve published a react@18.3 release that is identical to 18.2 but adds warnings for deprecated APIs and other changes that are needed for React 19. We recommend upgrading to React 18.3.1 first to help identify any issues before upgrading to React 19.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<h4>React</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Actions: <code>startTransition</code> can now accept async functions. Functions passed to <code>startTransition</code> are called “Actions”. A given Transition can include one or more Actions which update state in the background and update the UI with one commit. In addition to updating state, Actions can now perform side effects including async requests, and the Action will wait for the work to finish before finishing the Transition. This feature allows Transitions to include side effects like <code>fetch()</code> in the pending state, and provides support for error handling, and optimistic updates.</li>\n<li><code>useActionState</code>: is a new hook to order Actions inside of a Transition with access to the state of the action, and the pending state. It accepts a reducer that can call Actions, and the initial state used for first render. It also accepts an optional string that is used if the action is passed to a form <code>action</code> prop to support progressive enhancement in forms.</li>\n<li><code>useOptimistic</code>: is a new hook to update state while a Transition is in progress. It returns the state, and a set function that can be called inside a transition to “optimistically” update the state to expected final value immediately while the Transition completes in the background. When the transition finishes, the state is updated to the new value.</li>\n<li><code>use</code>: is a new API that allows reading resources in render. In React 19, <code>use</code> accepts a promise or Context. If provided a promise, <code>use</code> will suspend until a value is resolved. <code>use</code> can only be used in render but can be called conditionally.</li>\n<li><code>ref</code> as a prop: Refs can now be used as props, removing the need for <code>forwardRef</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Suspense sibling pre-warming</strong>: When a component suspends, React will immediately commit the fallback of the nearest Suspense boundary, without waiting for the entire sibling tree to render. After the fallback commits, React will schedule another render for the suspended siblings to “pre-warm” lazy requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>React DOM Client</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;form&gt; action</code> prop: Form Actions allow you to manage forms automatically and integrate with <code>useFormStatus</code>.

modification in an unexpected case. The test added in this case is a simplified reproducer for the reported issue.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue is that a read only traversal will increment an elements [usedInTransactions](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/077e3eb22c463545c3fc974944d4bf1d5d6a32fd/tinkergraph-gremlin/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/tinkergraph/structure/TinkerElementContainer.java#L65) count as the read operation must call [getWithClone()](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/077e3eb22c463545c3fc974944d4bf1d5d6a32fd/tinkergraph-gremlin/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/tinkergraph/structure/TinkerElementContainer.java#L90), however in 3.7.3, the `usedInTransactions` counter is never decremented for read-only elements when the transaction is committed.\r\n\r\nIn the example used in the test in this PR, vertex 1 will have an incorrect `usedInTransactions` of 1 after the read-only transaction has been committed. This causes the subsequent \"delete\" query not to remove the vertex from the graph as it is still \"in use\". This then leads to a TransactionException due to concurrent modification when the final query attempts to create a new vertex with the same ID.","created_at":"2025-01-25T05:33:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T19:12:59Z","closed_at":"2025-01-29T19:12:57Z","merged_at":"2025-01-29T19:12:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"818a1b32a243aff9c3a0eea5f8f520bfb612b685","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2992/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2992/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2992/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/3571198724263853fde09acf384b90b3e637a563","head":{"label":"apache:TinkerGraphTransactionsIncorrectCountOnRead","ref":"TinkerGraphTransactionsIncorrectCountOnRead","sha":"3571198724263853fde09acf384b90b3e637a563","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30449481,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDQ0OTQ4MQ==","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"apache/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

CHANGES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>@testing-library/dom</code> was moved to a peer dependency and needs to be explicitly installed.

previously discussed in the [devlist](https://lists.apache.org/thread/qh8h810s4tn9d6xltc4v0zp9n8fwt4qt), TinkerPop 4 should default to using gremlin-lang over gremlin-groovy in cases where users do not explicitly specify a language for a given script. This PR switches the default engine and updates any integration tests which were submitting incompatible scripts. For the most part I tried to replace with some an equivalent gremlin-lang traversal (eg `1+1` -> `g.inject(2)`). Some tests have been left with groovy as the behaviour cannot easily be replicated in gremlin-lang (mostly tests which use `Thread.sleep()` or use groovy to generate unserializable responses on the server)\r\n\r\nMy vote is VOTE

CHANGES</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>@testing-library/dom</code> was moved to a peer dependency and needs to be explicitly installed.

This PR fixed this flakiness by replacing the `HashMap` with `LinkedHashMap`.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-06T10:58:48Z","updated_at":"2024-12-16T17:46:21Z","closed_at":"2024-12-16T17:46:20Z","merged_at":"2024-12-16T17:46:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"62f62b9333b81f048e001cd4aecb8da791667d1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2943/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2943/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2943/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/0262b3823e86c4181546e7ed6d9b8ccbb7888bc8","head":{"label":"qz0610:fix-tests-2","ref":"fix-tests-2","sha":"0262b3823e86c4181546e7ed6d9b8ccbb7888bc8","user":{"login":"qz0610","id":101075497,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgZKKQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101075497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610","html_url":"https://github.com/qz0610","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":851925667,"node_id":"R_kgDOMsdaow","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"qz0610/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"qz0610","id":101075497,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgZKKQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101075497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610","html_url":"https://github.com/qz0610","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qz0610/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/qz0610/tinkerpop","description":"Apache
