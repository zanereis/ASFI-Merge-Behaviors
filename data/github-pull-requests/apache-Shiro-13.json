Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers

<code>mockito-inline</code></h2>\n<p>Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the &quot;inline bytecode&quot; principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates &quot;real&quot; subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<p>Note: this does not affect <code>mockito-android</code> nor testing on Android.</p>\n<h3>When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?</h3>\n<p>There are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.\nFor example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.\nNote however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.\nWe want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new <code>mockito-subclass</code> artifact (published <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass\">on Maven Central</a> along with all our other artifacts).</p>\n<h2>Update the minimum supported Java version to 11</h2>\n<p>Mockito 4 supports Java 8 and above.\nSimilar to other open source projects, we are moving away from JDK 8 and to newer versions.\nThe primary reason for moving away from JDK 8 is the increasing maintenance costs with keeping our own infrastructure working.\nLately we have been running into more and more JDK 8 breakages.\nAdditionally, while we want to support the newest JDK API's, our current solution to support both JDK 8 and newer versions causes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2798\">issues with the <code>SecurityManager</code></a>.\nSince we want Mockito to work on the newest version and more and more businesses adopting JDK 11, we have decided to make the switch as well.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>What should I do if I still run JDK 8?</h3>\n<p>For JDK 8 and below, you can keep on using Mockito 4.\nThis is similar to if you are using JDK 6, for which you can keep on using Mockito 2.\nThe changes in Mockito 5 (for now) are primarily focused on the latest JDK versions, which means the API differences between Mockito 4 and 5 are minimal.\nHowever, over time this will most likely widen, so we do recommend adopting JDK 11 in the future.</p>\n<h2>New <code>type()</code> method on <code>ArgumentMatcher</code></h2>\n<p>One of our most used public API's for customizing Mockito is the <a

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is

SHIRO-902 (proof that quoting works).\r\n\r\nAdding a test makes sense here so we do not accidentally remove the methods as I suggested earlier. 😃 \r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\n* Adds assertj as suggested on the mailing list earlier\r\n* Java 8 code style for the PermissionUtil.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-24T19:39:21Z","updated_at":"2023-01-27T18:22:35Z","closed_at":"2023-01-27T18:22:32Z","merged_at":"2023-01-27T18:22:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"1973173049442bb5388cd11a44d9c77edd45422f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/statuses/fb593f6ce632c489a2640d55a199c0fa86af60a9","head":{"label":"bmarwell:SHIRO_902_quoted_permissions","ref":"SHIRO_902_quoted_permissions","sha":"fb593f6ce632c489a2640d55a199c0fa86af60a9","user":{"login":"bmarwell","id":1413391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1413391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell","html_url":"https://github.com/bmarwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"73b47f5d3f519f8fac21eb2e64a7e114e93939ad","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":291570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTE1NzA=","name":"shiro","full_name":"apache/shiro","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro","description":"Apache

Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

[mockito-core](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) from 4.9.0 to 5.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases\">mockito-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Mockito 5: prepare for future JDK versions</h1>\n<p>For a while now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.</p>\n<h2>Switch the default mockmaker to <code>mockito-inline</code></h2>\n<p>Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the &quot;inline bytecode&quot; principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates &quot;real&quot; subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?</h3>\n<p>There are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.\nFor example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.\nNote however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.\nWe want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new <code>mockito-subclass</code> artifact (published <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass\">on Maven Central</a> along with all our other artifacts).</p>\n<h2>Update the minimum supported Java version to 11</h2>\n<p>Mockito 4 supports Java 8 and above.\nSimilar to other open source projects, we are moving away from JDK 8 and to newer versions.\nThe primary reason for moving away from JDK 8 is the increasing maintenance costs with keeping our own infrastructure working.\nLately we have been running into more and more JDK 8 breakages.\nAdditionally, while we want to support the newest JDK API's, our current solution to support both JDK 8 and newer versions causes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2798\">issues with the <code>SecurityManager</code></a>.\nSince we want Mockito to work on the newest version and more and more businesses adopting JDK 11, we have decided to make the switch as well.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>What should I do if I still run JDK 8?</h3>\n<p>For JDK 8 and below, you can keep on using Mockito 4.\nThis is similar to if you are using JDK 6, for which you can keep on using Mockito 2.\nThe changes in Mockito 5 (for now) are primarily focused on the latest JDK versions, which means the API differences between Mockito 4 and 5 are minimal.\nHowever, over time this will most likely widen, so we do recommend adopting JDK 11 in the future.</p>\n<h2>New <code>type()</code> method on <code>ArgumentMatcher</code></h2>\n<p>One of our most used public API's for customizing Mockito is the <a href=\"https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/ArgumentMatcher.html\"><code>ArgumentMatcher</code> interface</a>.\nThe interface allows you to define a custom matcher, which you can pass into method arguments to provide more targeted matches.\nOne major shortcoming of the <code>ArgumentMatcher</code> was the lack of varargs support.</p>\n<!-- raw

removed or deprecated features for <strong>Hazelcast Platform 5.2.1</strong> releases. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for discovering ECS and EC2 members on AWS. See Deploying a Cluster on Amazon AWS. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22590\">#22590</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a memory leak due to incomplete clean-up of backup replica sync operations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22756\">#22756</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a map was loading old values with <code>map.set()</code> when map store offloading is enabled. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22603\">#22603</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the map entries recovered from persistence were not expiring after their time-to-live durations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22557\">#22557</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where external data store configurations could not be added dynamically. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22464\">#22464</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v5.2.0</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for <strong>Hazelcast Platform 5.2.0</strong> release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SQL stream-to-stream joins:</strong> You can now correlate multiple streams of data with each other using the relational join operation.</li>\n<li><strong>Generic MapStore (BETA):</strong> You no longer need to write Java code to get data from an external data store, such as a relational database, into Hazelcast by implementing the\n<code>MapStore</code> or <code>MapLoader</code> interfaces.</li>\n<li><strong>JDBC connector (BETA):</strong> You can now use SQL to connect to and query any database that supports the JDBC interface.</li>\n<li><strong>CP Subsystem Leadership Priority:</strong> To ensure the availability of the CP subsystem, you can now transfer CP member leadership to another member:\nThere are cases when some CP members should not act as a leader. For example, a member with high load would not be a good leader, or, in a WAN deployment, members in a primary datacenter may be preferred in order to minimize the latency between the clients and leader. You can transfer the leadership using the <code>cp-member-priority</code> configuration element. See Configuring Leadership Priority.</li>\n<li><strong>User Defined Types (Experimental):</strong> You can now query nested objects within Java, compact, and portable mappings using the User Defined Types (UDTs).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced a check to control the versions of Hazelcast Platform members and Hazelcast CLI are matched. Previously, it was possible to submit a job using a different version of CLI from the member version. Generally, it would work when there were no change in the serialized form of pipeline. Now, Hazelcast fails earlier in this case. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22224\">#22224</a></li>\n<li>Removed the <code>BETA</code> annotations from the compact serialization and <code>GenericRecord</code> related classes, i.e., they are stable. Now, compact serialization is enabled by default; the <code>enabled</code> attribute within the <code>compact-serialization</code> configuration block does not exist anymore. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21997\">#21997</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MapStore Offloading:</strong> Added <code>offload</code> element to map store configuration. It is used to offload map store and loader operations for each map in the cluster. This way, a map store operation does not block the next operations by blocking a partition thread indefinitely. Partition threads are one of the most important shared resources in a cluster; this offloading enables faster completion of the operations in these threads.\nSee Offloading MapStore and MapLoader Operations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21651\">#21651</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SQL Engine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple performance enhancements in the SQL engine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Distribution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed <code>hazelcast-hibernate53</code> dependency from the main Hazelcast Platform distribution as it is not needed anymore. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22282\">#22282</a></li>\n<li>Minor versions of Hazelcast Platform are now released as X.Y.0, instead of the previous X.Y versioning scheme. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22218\">#22218</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Serialization</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.2.6</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 4.2.z releases. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.</p>\n<p>==== 4.2.6 ====</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrade jackson-databind to 2.14.0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22391\">#22391</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where replication over WAN was failing on the source cluster members, when there are multiple batch publishers configured in a single WAN replication. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22496\">#22496</a></li>\n<li>Fixed a memory leak due to incomplete clean-up of backup replica sync operations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22406\">#22406</a></li>\n<li>Fixed the cluster failure occurred after requesting healthcheck of a member using REST API while the <code>hazelcast.socket.buffer.direct</code> property is enabled. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21702\">#21702</a></li>\n<li>Improved connection handling. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21643\">#21643</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a cluster could not be formed when security is enabled, various client permissions are set,\nand multiple members are started simultaneously. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21508\">#21508</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== 4.2.5 ====</p>\n<p>If you’re using eviction or expiration for maps, you must set the per-entry-stats-enabled property to true to fix an issue in version 4.2.x where some map entries are not always evicted or expired according to their time-to-live or maximum idle duration configurations.</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced a system property for allowing you to audit that all the Hazelcast instances running in your environment have the instance tracking file name set correctly in the configuration. See the note in Instance Tracking. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19929\">#19929</a></li>\n<li>Enabled XXE (XML External Entity Reference) protection for XMLInputFactory. The issue was reported through <a href=\"https://huntr.dev/bounties/d63972a2-b910-480a-a86b-d1f75d24d563/\">https://huntr.dev/bounties/d63972a2-b910-480a-a86b-d1f75d24d563/</a>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20942\">#20942</a></li>\n<li>The probe level for most of the network related statistics has been changed to &quot;DEBUG&quot; to decrease the pressure on Management Center; now they are not sent to Management Center by default. If you want to see these statistics, you need to set the &quot;hazelcast.metrics.debug.enabled&quot; property to true. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21275\">#21275</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the statistics like puts and removals were not increasing when these operations are executed through Transactional interface. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21105\">#21105</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where Hazelcast clients, which have only the IP address of a member to connect (but the member also has a hostname), were not able to connect to the cluster. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20631\">#20631</a></li>\n<li>Hazelcast’s memcached implementation was interpreting the number values and parameters for incr and decr wrongly (numbers were being converted into byte arrays instead of decimals). This has been fixed by making these commands' implementations strictly follow the memcached protocol specification. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19676\">#19676</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the totalPublishes statistics for the Reliable Topic data structure were always generated as 0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19656\">#19656</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the map.clear() and cache.clear() methods were evicting all entries in all near caches of all the maps in a cluster, not only the map on which these methods are called. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19501\">#19501</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue that caused some map entries to remain in Hazelcast even when you configured eviction or expiration. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19483\">#19483</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removed/Deprecated Features</h2>\n<p>The following system properties have been deprecated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hazelcast.client.statistics.enabled</li>\n<li>hazelcast.client.statistics.period.seconds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== 4.2.4 =====</p>\n<p>For the distributions packages of IMDG, we updated the vulnerable version of log4j2 in Management Center to 2.17.0.
