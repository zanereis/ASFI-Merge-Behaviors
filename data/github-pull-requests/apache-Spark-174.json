for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate the following `ALTER TABLE` commands that alter columns to use `UnresolvedTable` as a `child` to resolve the table identifier:\r\n* `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMNS`\r\n* `ALTER TABLE ... REPLACE COLUMNS`\r\n* `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN`\r\n* `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN`\r\n* `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMNS`\r\n\r\nThis allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a part of effort to make the relation lookup behavior consistent: [SPARK-29900](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, the above `ALTER TABLE` commands will have a consistent resolution behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-35253 upgraded janino from 3.0.16 to 3.1.4, `ClassBodyEvaluator` provides the `getBytecodes` method to get \r\nthe mapping from `ClassFile#getThisClassName` to `ClassFile#toByteArray` directly in this version and we don't need to get this variable by reflection api anymore.\r\n\r\nSo the main purpose of this pr is simplify the way to get `bytecodes` from `ClassBodyEvaluator` in `CodeGenerator#updateAndGetCompilationStats` method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCode simplification.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Manual test:\r\n\r\n1. Define a code fragment to be tested, for example:\r\n```\r\n    val codeBody = s\"\"\"\r\n        public java.lang.Object generate(Object[] references) {\r\n          return new TestMetricCode(references);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        class TestMetricCode {\r\n\r\n          public TestMetricCode(Object[] references) {\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          public long sumOfSquares(long left, long right) {\r\n            return left * left + right * right;\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n2. Create a `ClassBodyEvaluator` and `cook` the `codeBody` as above, the process of creating `ClassBodyEvaluator` can extract from `CodeGenerator#doCompile` method.\r\n\r\n3. Get `bytecodes` using `ClassBodyEvaluator#getBytecodes` api(after this pr) and reflection api(before this pr) respectively, then assert that they are the same. If the `bytecodes` not changed, we can be sure that metrics state will not change. The test code example as follows:\r\n```\r\n    import scala.collection.JavaConverters._\r\n    val bytecodesFromApi = evaluator.getBytecodes.asScala\r\n    val bytecodesFromReflectionApi = {\r\n      val scField = classOf[ClassBodyEvaluator].getDeclaredField(\"sc\")\r\n      scField.setAccessible(true)\r\n      val compiler = scField.get(evaluator).asInstanceOf[SimpleCompiler]\r\n      val loader = compiler.getClassLoader.asInstanceOf[ByteArrayClassLoader]\r\n      val classesField = loader.getClass.getDeclaredField(\"classes\")\r\n      classesField.setAccessible(true)\r\n      classesField.get(loader).asInstanceOf[java.util.Map[String, Array[Byte]]].asScala\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    assert(bytecodesFromApi ==

PR is proposing a add-on to support to manual close entries in MemoryStore and InMemoryRelation\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently:\r\n    MemoryStore uses a LinkedHashMap[BlockId, MemoryEntry[_]] to store all OnHeap or OffHeap entries.\r\nAnd when memoryStore.remove(blockId) is called, codes will simply remove one entry from LinkedHashMap and leverage Java GC to do release work.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n    We are proposing a add-on to manually close any object stored in MemoryStore and InMemoryRelation if this object is extended from AutoCloseable.\r\n\r\nVeifiication:\r\n    In our own use case, we implemented a user-defined off-heap-hashRelation for BHJ, and we verified that by adding this manual close, we can make sure our defined off-heap-hashRelation can be released when evict is called.\r\n    Also, we implemented user-defined cachedBatch and will be release when InMemoryRelation.clearCache() is called by this PR \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis changes can help to clean some off-heap user-defined object may be cached in InMemoryRelation or MemoryStore\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the check of `summary.logLikelihood` in  ml/clustering.py - this GMM test is quite flaky. It fails easily e.g., if:\r\n- change number of partitions;\r\n- just change the way to compute the sum of weights;\r\n- change the underlying BLAS impl\r\n\r\nAlso uses more permissive precision on `Word2Vec` test case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo recover the build and tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMove hash map lookup operation out of `InvokeLike.invoke` since it doesn't depend on the input.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't need to look up the hash map for every input row evaluated by `InvokeLike.invoke` since it doesn't depend on input. This could speed up the performance a bit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to unify two K8s version variables in two `pom.xml`s into one. `kubernetes-client.version` is correct because the artifact ID is `kubernetes-client`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubernetes.client.version (kubernetes/core module)\r\nkubernetes-client.version (kubernetes/integration-test module)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHaving two variables for the same value is confusing and inconvenient when we upgrade K8s versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs. (The compilation test passes are

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. In HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol, create parent directory before renaming custom partition path staging files\r\n2. In InMemoryCatalog and HiveExternalCatalog, create new partition directory before renaming old partition path\r\n3. Check return value of FileSystem#rename, if false, throw exception to avoid silent data loss cause by rename failure\r\n4. Change DebugFilesystem#rename behavior to make it match HDFS's behavior (return false without rename when dst parent directory not exist)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDepends on FileSystem#rename implementation, when destination directory does not exist, file system may\r\n1. return false without renaming file nor throwing exception (e.g. HDFS), or\r\n2. create destination directory, rename files, and return true (e.g. LocalFileSystem)\r\n\r\nIn the first case above, renames in HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol for custom partition path will fail silently if the destination partition path does not exist. Failed renames can happen when\r\n1. dynamicPartitionOverwrite == true, the custom partition path directories are deleted by the job before the rename; or\r\n2. the custom partition path directories do not exist before the job; or\r\n3. something else is wrong when file system handle `rename`\r\n\r\nThe renames in MemoryCatalog and HiveExternalCatalog for partition renaming also have similar issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nModified DebugFilesystem#rename, and added new unit tests.\r\n\r\nWithout the fix in src code, five InsertSuite tests and one AlterTableRenamePartitionSuite test failed:\r\nInsertSuite.SPARK-20236: dynamic partition overwrite with custom partition path (existing test with modified FS)\r\n```\r\n== Results ==\r\n!== Correct Answer - 1 ==   == Spark Answer - 0 ==\r\nstruct<>                   struct<>\r\n![2,1,1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nInsertSuite.SPARK-35106: insert overwrite with custom partition path\r\n```\r\n== Results ==\r\n!== Correct Answer - 1 ==   == Spark Answer - 0 ==\r\nstruct<>                   struct<>\r\n![2,1,1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nInsertSuite.SPARK-35106: dynamic partition overwrite with custom partition path\r\n```\r\n== Results ==\r\n!== Correct Answer - 2 ==   == Spark Answer - 1 ==\r\n!struct<>                   struct<i:int,part1:int,part2:int>\r\n [1,1,1]                    [1,1,1]\r\n![1,1,2]   \r\n```\r\n\r\nInsertSuite.SPARK-35106: Throw exception when rename custom partition paths returns false\r\n```\r\nExpected exception org.apache.spark.SparkException to be thrown, but no exception was thrown\r\n```\r\n\r\nInsertSuite.SPARK-35106: Throw exception when rename dynamic partition paths returns false\r\n```\r\nExpected exception org.apache.spark.SparkException to be thrown, but no exception was thrown\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlterTableRenamePartitionSuite.ALTER TABLE ..

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. In HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol, create parent directory before renaming custom partition path staging files\r\n2. In InMemoryCatalog and HiveExternalCatalog, create new partition directory before renaming old partition path\r\n3. Check return value of FileSystem#rename, if false, throw exception to avoid silent data loss cause by rename failure\r\n4. Change DebugFilesystem#rename behavior to make it match HDFS's behavior (return false without rename when dst parent directory not exist)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDepends on FileSystem#rename implementation, when destination directory does not exist, file system may\r\n1. return false without renaming file nor throwing exception (e.g. HDFS), or\r\n2. create destination directory, rename files, and return true (e.g. LocalFileSystem)\r\n\r\nIn the first case above, renames in HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol for custom partition path will fail silently if the destination partition path does not exist. Failed renames can happen when\r\n1. dynamicPartitionOverwrite == true, the custom partition path directories are deleted by the job before the rename; or\r\n2. the custom partition path directories do not exist before the job; or\r\n3. something else is wrong when file system handle `rename`\r\n\r\nThe renames in MemoryCatalog and HiveExternalCatalog for partition renaming also have similar issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nModified DebugFilesystem#rename, and added new unit tests.\r\n\r\nWithout the fix in src code, four InsertSuite tests and one AlterTableRenamePartitionSuite test failed:\r\nInsertSuite.SPARK-20236: dynamic partition overwrite with custom partition path (existing test with modified FS)\r\n```\r\n== Results ==\r\n!== Correct Answer - 1 ==   == Spark Answer - 0 ==\r\nstruct<>                   struct<>\r\n![2,1,1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nInsertSuite.SPARK-35106: insert overwrite with custom partition path\r\n```\r\n== Results ==\r\n!== Correct Answer - 1 ==   == Spark Answer - 0 ==\r\nstruct<>                   struct<>\r\n![2,1,1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nInsertSuite.SPARK-35106: Throw exception when rename custom partition paths returns false\r\n```\r\nExpected exception org.apache.spark.SparkException to be thrown, but no exception was thrown\r\n```\r\n\r\nInsertSuite.SPARK-35106: Throw exception when rename dynamic partition paths returns false\r\n```\r\nExpected exception org.apache.spark.SparkException to be thrown, but no exception was thrown\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlterTableRenamePartitionSuite.ALTER TABLE ..

The main change is to add `semiJoin` code path in `SortMergeJoinExec.doProduce()` and introduce `onlyBufferFirstMatchedRow` in `SortMergeJoinExec.genScanner()`.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nChange `map` in `InvokeLike.invoke` to a while loop to improve performance, following Spark [style guide](https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guide#traversal-and-zipwithindex).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`InvokeLike.invoke`, which is used in non-codegen path for `Invoke` and `StaticInvoke`, currently uses `map` to evaluate arguments:\r\n```scala\r\nval args = arguments.map(e => e.eval(input).asInstanceOf[Object])\r\nif (needNullCheck && args.exists(_ == null)) {\r\n  // return null if one of arguments is null\r\n  null\r\n} else { \r\n  ...\r\n```\r\nwhich is pretty expensive if the method itself is trivial. We can change it to a plain while loop.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"871\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-05-12 at 12 19 59 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506679/118055719-7f985a00-b33d-11eb-943b-cf85eab35f44.png\">\r\n\r\nBenchmark results show this can improve as much as 3x from `V2FunctionBenchmark`:\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n```\r\n OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_292-b10 on Linux 5.4.0-1046-azure\r\n Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2673 v3 @ 2.40GHz\r\n scalar function (long + long) -> long, result_nullable = false codegen = false:  Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n native_long_add                                                                         36506          36656         251         13.7          73.0       1.0X\r\n java_long_add_default                                                                   47151          47540         370         10.6          94.3       0.8X\r\n java_long_add_magic                                                                    178691         182457        1327          2.8         357.4       0.2X\r\n java_long_add_static_magic                                                             177151         178258        1151          2.8         354.3       0.2X\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n```\r\n OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_292-b10 on Linux 5.4.0-1046-azure\r\n Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2673 v3 @ 2.40GHz\r\n scalar function (long + long) -> long, result_nullable = false codegen = false:  Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n native_long_add                                                                         29897          30342         568         16.7          59.8       1.0X\r\n java_long_add_default                                                                   40628          41075         664         12.3          81.3       0.7X\r\n java_long_add_magic                                                                     54553          54755         182          9.2         109.1       0.5X\r\n java_long_add_static_magic                                                              55410          55532         127          9.0         110.8       0.5X\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve S3A magic committer support by inferring all missing configs from a single minimum configuration, `spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.bucket.<bucket>.committer.magic.enabled=true`.\r\n\r\nGiven that AWS S3 provides a [strong read-after-write consistency](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/) since December 2020, we can ignore DynamoDB-related configurations. As a result, the minimum set of configuration are the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.hadoop.fs.s3a.committer.magic.enabled=true\r\nspark.hadoop.fs.s3a.bucket.<bucket>.committer.magic.enabled=true\r\nspark.hadoop.fs.s3a.committer.name=magic\r\nspark.hadoop.mapreduce.outputcommitter.factory.scheme.s3a=org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.commit.S3ACommitterFactory\r\nspark.sql.parquet.output.committer.class=org.apache.spark.internal.io.cloud.BindingParquetOutputCommitter\r\nspark.sql.sources.commitProtocolClass=org.apache.spark.internal.io.cloud.PathOutputCommitProtocol\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo use S3A magic committer in Apache Spark, the users need to setup a set of configurations. And, if something is missed, it will end up with the error messages like the following.\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.commit.PathCommitException:\r\n`s3a://my-spark-bucket`: Filesystem does not have support for 'magic' committer enabled in configuration option fs.s3a.committer.magic.enabled\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.commit.CommitUtils.verifyIsMagicCommitFS(CommitUtils.java:74)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.commit.CommitUtils.getS3AFileSystem(CommitUtils.java:109)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, after this improvement PR, all Spark users can use S3A committer by using a single configuration.\r\n```\r\nspark.hadoop.fs.s3a.bucket.<bucket>.committer.magic.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is going to inferring the missing configurations. So, there is no side-effect if the existing users who have all configurations already.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark eagerly executes commands on the caller side of `QueryExecution`, which is a bit hacky as `QueryExecution` is not aware of it and leads to confusion.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you run `sql(\"show tables\").collect()`, you will see two queries with identical query plans in the web UI.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3182036/121193729-a72d0480-c8a0-11eb-8b12-379019607ad5.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3182036/121193822-bc099800-c8a0-11eb-9d2a-34ab1329e2f7.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3182036/121193845-c0ce4c00-c8a0-11eb-96d0-ef604a4dfab0.png)\r\n\r\nThe first query is triggered at `Dataset.logicalPlan`, which eagerly executes the command.\r\nThe second query is triggered at `Dataset.collect`, which is the normal query execution.\r\n\r\nFrom the web UI, it's hard to tell that these two queries are caused by eager command execution.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move the eager command execution to `QueryExecution`, and turn the command plan to `CommandResult` to indicate that command has been executed already. Now `sql(\"show tables\").collect()` still triggers two queries, but the quey plans are not identical. The second query becomes:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3182036/121194850-b3659180-c8a1-11eb-9abf-2980f84f089d.png)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the UI improvements, this PR also has other benefits:\r\n1. Simplifies code as caller side no need to worry about eager command execution. `QueryExecution` takes care of it.\r\n2. It helps https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32442 , where there can be more plan nodes above commands, and we need to replace commands with something like local relation that produces unsafe rows.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExplained above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSometimes, numbers are represented as string in JSON texts so it's helpful to convert them on load if types are specified by schema.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. numbers represented as string is no longer null if users explicitly specify types.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nGenerally, we would expect that x = y => hash( x ) = hash( y ). However +-0 hash to different values for floating point types.\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select hash(cast('0.0' as double)), hash(cast('-0.0' as double))\").show\r\n+-------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n|hash(CAST(0.0 AS DOUBLE))|hash(CAST(-0.0 AS DOUBLE))|\r\n+-------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n|              -1670924195|                -853646085|\r\n+-------------------------+--------------------------+\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select cast('0.0' as double) == cast('-0.0' as double)\").show\r\n+--------------------------------------------+\r\n|(CAST(0.0 AS DOUBLE) = CAST(-0.0 AS DOUBLE))|\r\n+--------------------------------------------+\r\n|                                        true|\r\n+--------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nHere is an extract from IEEE 754: \r\n\r\n> The two zeros are distinguishable arithmetically only by either division-byzero ( producing appropriately signed infinities ) or else by the CopySign function recommended by IEEE 754 /854. Infinities, SNaNs, NaNs and Subnormal numbers necessitate four more special cases\r\n\r\nFrom this, I deduce that the hash function must produce the same result for 0 and -0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt is a correctness issue\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThis changes only affect to the hash function applied to -0 value in float and double types\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a pre-requisite of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32476, in discussion of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32476#issuecomment-836469779 . This is to refactor sort merge join code-gen to depend on streamed/buffered terminology, which makes the code-gen agnostic to different join types and can be extended to support other join types than inner join.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPre-requisite of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32476.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit test in `InnerJoinSuite.scala` for inner join

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChange the definition of `findTightestCommonType` from\r\n```\r\ndef findTightestCommonType(t1: DataType, t2: DataType): Option[DataType]\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\nval findTightestCommonType: (DataType, DataType) => Option[DataType]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor backward compatibility. \r\nWhen running a MongoDB connector (built with Spark 3.1.1) with the latest master, there is such an error\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.TypeCoercion$.findTightestCommonType()Lscala/Function2\r\n```\r\nfrom https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-spark/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/mongodb/spark/sql/MongoInferSchema.scala#L150\r\n\r\nIn the previous release, the function was\r\n```\r\nstatic public  scala.Function2<org.apache.spark.sql.types.DataType, org.apache.spark.sql.types.DataType, scala.Option<org.apache.spark.sql.types.DataType>> findTightestCommonType ()\r\n```\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31349, the function becomes:\r\n```\r\nstatic public  scala.Option<org.apache.spark.sql.types.DataType> findTightestCommonType (org.apache.spark.sql.types.DataType t1, org.apache.spark.sql.types.DataType t2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is to reduce the unnecessary API change.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the definition of `TypeCoercion.findTightestCommonType`  is consistent with previous release again.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to increase the maximum heap memory setting for release build.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen I was cutting RCs for 2.4.8, I frequently encountered OOM during building using mvn. It happens many times until I increased the heap memory setting.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if other release managers encounter the same issue. So I propose to increase the heap memory setting and see if it looks good for others.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, dev only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually used it during cutting RCs of

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with a non negligible proportion of sinks in a graph, algorithm based on incremental update of ranks can get a **precision gain for free** if they are allowed to manipulate non normalized ranks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBy adding a unit test that verifies that (even when dealing with a graph containing a sink) we end up with the same result for both these scenarios:\r\na)\r\n  - Run **6 iterations** of pagerank in a row using `PageRank.runWithOptions` with **normalization enabled**\r\n\r\nb)\r\n  - Run **2 iterations** using `PageRank.runWithOptions` with **normalization disabled**\r\n  - Resume from the `preRankGraph1` and run **2 more iterations** using `PageRank.runWithOptionsWithPreviousPageRank` with **normalization disabled**\r\n  - Finally resume from the `preRankGraph2` and run **2 more iterations** using `PageRank.runWithOptionsWithPreviousPageRank` with **normalization enabled**\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-09T12:35:54Z","updated_at":"2021-05-09T14:13:10Z","closed_at":"2021-05-09T14:12:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b55b3b3c47e9d0580dcea28e79e33a6702dfc82a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406607243,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA3MjQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/GRAPHX","name":"GRAPHX","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32484/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32484/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32484/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e407e881ee4f0e6dffe90244b9b3a5308ba94e79","head":{"label":"ebonnal:enh/opt-pagerank-normalization","ref":"enh/opt-pagerank-normalization","sha":"e407e881ee4f0e6dffe90244b9b3a5308ba94e79","user":{"login":"ebonnal","id":32455369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDU1MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32455369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal","html_url":"https://github.com/ebonnal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235824607,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzU4MjQ2MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ebonnal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ebonnal","id":32455369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNDU1MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32455369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal","html_url":"https://github.com/ebonnal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebonnal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ebonnal/spark","description":"contribution:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nChange `failOnError` to false for `NativeAdd` in `V2FunctionBenchmark`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince `NativeAdd` is simply doing addition on long it's better to set `failOnError` to false so it will use native long addition instead of `Math.addExact`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nN/A","created_at":"2021-05-09T03:54:39Z","updated_at":"2021-05-10T07:20:16Z","closed_at":"2021-05-10T07:20:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ab3d18bbf28ba0b3e4d239fb17eba9e51e083224","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f9f12b14d1aec348b4f92f48eb04e27c6bc3d413","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-35261-follow-up","ref":"SPARK-35261-follow-up","sha":"f9f12b14d1aec348b4f92f48eb04e27c6bc3d413","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new job in GitHub Actions to check the output of TPC-DS queries.\r\n\r\nNOTE: To generate TPC-DS table data in GA jobs, this PR includes generator code implemented in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32243 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32460.\r\n\r\nThis is the backport PR of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31886.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere are some cases where we noticed runtime-realted bugs after merging commits (e.g. .SPARK-33822). Therefore, I think it is worth adding a new job in GitHub Actions to check query output of TPC-DS (sf=1).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThe new test added.","created_at":"2021-05-08T12:57:12Z","updated_at":"2021-05-09T03:12:23Z","closed_at":"2021-05-09T02:26:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"91605d1f62ea1ff09db2d3d12bdf00301016c547","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32479/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32479/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32479/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/005960c65a9f47d6fbf6cf72989afd614e239836","head":{"label":"maropu:TPCDSQueryTestSuite-Branch3.0","ref":"TPCDSQueryTestSuite-Branch3.0","sha":"005960c65a9f47d6fbf6cf72989afd614e239836","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`ANSI SQL: SIMILAR TO ... ESCAPE` is very useful.\r\nThere are some mainstream database support the syntax.\r\n**PostgreSQL**:\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-SIMILARTO-REGEXP\r\n\r\n**Redshift**:\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/pattern-matching-conditions-similar-to.html\r\n\r\n**Sybase**:\r\nhttp://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.help.sqlanywhere.12.0.0/dbreference/like-regexp-similarto.html\r\n\r\n**Firebird**:\r\nhttp://firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/html/en/refdocs/fblangref25/firebird-25-language-reference.html#fblangref25-commons-predsiimilarto\r\n\r\nThis util supports the following pattern-matching metacharacters:\r\n\r\nOperator | Description\r\n-- | --\r\n% | Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.\r\n_ | Matches any single character.\r\n\\| | Denotes alternation (either of two alternatives).\r\n\\* | Repeat the previous item zero or more times.\r\n\\+ | Repeat the previous item one or more times.\r\n? | Repeat the previous item zero or one time.\r\n{m} | Repeat the previous item exactly m times.\r\n{m,} | Repeat the previous item m or more times.\r\n{m,n} | Repeat the previous item at least m and not more than n times.\r\n() | Parentheses group items into a single logical item.\r\n[...] | A bracket expression specifies a character class, just as in POSIX regular expressions.\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\n`SIMILAR TO` is similar to `RLIKE`, but with the following differences:\r\n       1. The `SIMILAR TO` operator returns true only if its pattern matches the entire string,\r\n          unlike `RLIKE` behavior, where the pattern can match any portion of the string.\r\n       2. The regex string allow use _ and % as wildcard characters denoting any single character\r\n          and any string, respectively (these are comparable to . and .* in POSIX regular\r\n          expressions).\r\n       3. The regex string allow use escape character like `LIKE` behavior.\r\n       4. '.', '^' and '$' is not a meta character for `SIMILAR TO`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`ANSI SQL: SIMILAR TO ...

Currently sort merge join only supports inner join type (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/joins/SortMergeJoinExec.scala#L374 ). There's no fundamental reason why we cannot support code-gen for other join types. Here we add code-gen for LEFT OUTER / RIGHT OUTER join. Will submit followup PRs to add LEFT SEMI, LEFT ANTI and FULL OUTER code-gen separately.\r\n\r\nThe change is to extend current sort merge join logic to work with LEFT OUTER and RIGHT OUTER (should work with LEFT SEMI/ANTI as well, but FULL OUTER join needs some other more code change). Replace left/right with streamed/buffered to make code extendable to other join types besides inner join.\r\n\r\nExample query:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df1 = spark.range(10).select($\"id\".as(\"k1\"), $\"id\".as(\"k3\"))\r\nval df2 = spark.range(4).select($\"id\".as(\"k2\"), $\"id\".as(\"k4\"))\r\ndf1.join(df2.hint(\"SHUFFLE_MERGE\"), $\"k1\" === $\"k2\" && $\"k3\" + 1 < $\"k4\", \"left_outer\").explain(\"codegen\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample generated code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Subtree 5 / 5 (maxMethodCodeSize:396; maxConstantPoolSize:159(0.24% used); numInnerClasses:0) ==\r\n*(5) SortMergeJoin [k1#2L], [k2#8L], LeftOuter, ((k3#3L + 1) < k4#9L)\r\n:- *(2) Sort [k1#2L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(k1#2L, 5), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [id=#26]\r\n:     +- *(1) Project [id#0L AS k1#2L, id#0L AS k3#3L]\r\n:        +- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n+- *(4) Sort [k2#8L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(k2#8L, 5), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [id=#32]\r\n      +- *(3) Project [id#6L AS k2#8L, id#6L AS k4#9L]\r\n         +- *(3) Range (0, 4, step=1, splits=2)\r\n\r\nGenerated code:\r\n/* 001 */ public Object generate(Object[] references) {\r\n/* 002 */   return new GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage5(references);\r\n/* 003 */ }\r\n/* 004 */\r\n/* 005 */ // codegenStageId=5\r\n/* 006 */ final class GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage5 extends org.apache.spark.sql.execution.BufferedRowIterator {\r\n/* 007 */   private Object[] references;\r\n/* 008 */   private scala.collection.Iterator[] inputs;\r\n/* 009 */   private scala.collection.Iterator smj_streamedInput_0;\r\n/* 010 */   private scala.collection.Iterator smj_bufferedInput_0;\r\n/* 011 */   private InternalRow smj_streamedRow_0;\r\n/* 012 */   private InternalRow smj_bufferedRow_0;\r\n/* 013 */   private long smj_value_2;\r\n/* 014 */   private org.apache.spark.sql.execution.ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray smj_matches_0;\r\n/* 015 */   private long smj_value_3;\r\n/* 016 */   private org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter[] smj_mutableStateArray_0 = new org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter[1];\r\n/* 017 */\r\n/* 018 */   public GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage5(Object[] references) {\r\n/* 019 */     this.references = references;\r\n/* 020 */   }\r\n/* 021 */\r\n/* 022 */   public void init(int index, scala.collection.Iterator[] inputs) {\r\n/* 023 */     partitionIndex = index;\r\n/* 024 */     this.inputs = inputs;\r\n/* 025 */     smj_streamedInput_0 = inputs[0];\r\n/* 026 */     smj_bufferedInput_0 = inputs[1];\r\n/* 027 */\r\n/* 028 */     smj_matches_0 = new org.apache.spark.sql.execution.ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray(2147483632, 2147483647);\r\n/* 029 */     smj_mutableStateArray_0[0] = new org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter(4, 0);\r\n/* 030 */\r\n/* 031 */   }\r\n/* 032 */\r\n/* 033 */   private boolean findNextJoinRows(\r\n/* 034 */     scala.collection.Iterator streamedIter,\r\n/* 035 */     scala.collection.Iterator bufferedIter) {\r\n/* 036 */     smj_streamedRow_0 = null;\r\n/* 037 */     int comp = 0;\r\n/* 038 */     while (smj_streamedRow_0 == null) {\r\n/* 039 */       if (!streamedIter.hasNext()) return false;\r\n/* 040 */       smj_streamedRow_0 = (InternalRow) streamedIter.next();\r\n/* 041 */       long smj_value_0 = smj_streamedRow_0.getLong(0);\r\n/* 042 */       if (false) {\r\n/* 043 */         if (!smj_matches_0.isEmpty()) {\r\n/* 044 */           smj_matches_0.clear();\r\n/* 045 */         }\r\n/* 046 */         return false;\r\n/* 047 */\r\n/* 048 */       }\r\n/* 049 */       if (!smj_matches_0.isEmpty()) {\r\n/* 050 */         comp = 0;\r\n/* 051 */         if (comp == 0) {\r\n/* 052 */           comp = (smj_value_0 > smj_value_3 ?

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to use `MethodUtils` for looking up methods `Invoke` and `StaticInvoke` expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we wrote our logic in `Invoke` and `StaticInvoke` expressions for looking up methods. It is tricky to consider all the cases and there is already existing utility package for this purpose. We should reuse the utility package.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, internal change only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2021-05-08T06:05:16Z","updated_at":"2021-05-12T02:58:00Z","closed_at":"2021-05-08T22:17:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84d41e082b633b2bb6db1bb091c94b48564fea13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32474/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32474/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32474/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b96cb265c07fd8f77dbcf7e5503a22751fe5a1c","head":{"label":"viirya:invoke-util","ref":"invoke-util","sha":"7b96cb265c07fd8f77dbcf7e5503a22751fe5a1c","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[HIVE-10319](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-10319) introduced a new API `get_all_functions` which is only supported in Hive 1.3.0/2.0.0 and up. As result, when Spark 3.x talks to a HMS service of version 1.2 or lower, the following error will occur:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: org.apache.thrift.TApplicationException: Invalid method name: 'get_all_functions'\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.getAllFunctions(Hive.java:3897)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.reloadFunctions(Hive.java:248)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.registerAllFunctionsOnce(Hive.java:231)\r\n        ... 96 more\r\nCaused by: org.apache.thrift.TApplicationException: Invalid method name: 'get_all_functions'\r\n        at org.apache.thrift.TServiceClient.receiveBase(TServiceClient.java:79)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.ThriftHiveMetastore$Client.recv_get_all_functions(ThriftHiveMetastore.java:3845)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.ThriftHiveMetastore$Client.get_all_functions(ThriftHiveMetastore.java:3833)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `get_all_functions` is called only when `doRegisterAllFns` is set to true:\r\n```java\r\n  private Hive(HiveConf c, boolean doRegisterAllFns) throws HiveException {\r\n    conf = c;\r\n    if (doRegisterAllFns) {\r\n      registerAllFunctionsOnce();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhat this does is to register all Hive permanent functions defined in HMS in Hive's `FunctionRegistry` class, via iterating through results from `get_all_functions`. To Spark, this seems unnecessary as it loads Hive permanent (not built-in) UDF via directly calling the HMS API, i.e., `get_function`. The `FunctionRegistry` is only used in loading Hive's built-in function that is not supported by Spark. At this time, it only applies to `histogram_numeric`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes with this fix Spark now should be able to talk to HMS server with Hive 1.2.x and lower (with HIVE-24608 too)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually started a HMS server of Hive version 1.2.2, with patched Hive 2.3.8 using HIVE-24608. Without the PR it failed with the above exception. With the PR the error disappeared and I can successfully perform common operations such as create table, create database, list tables, etc.","created_at":"2021-05-07T22:18:31Z","updated_at":"2021-05-08T01:05:09Z","closed_at":"2021-05-08T00:40:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ceb99d28232d603a62ed113984def275a495158","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32472/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32472/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32472/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/87811359ca13a823a63aa08c21b3a7da75657eb6","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-35321-3.1","ref":"SPARK-35321-3.1","sha":"87811359ca13a823a63aa08c21b3a7da75657eb6","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[HIVE-10319](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-10319) introduced a new API `get_all_functions` which is only supported in Hive 1.3.0/2.0.0 and up. As result, when Spark 3.x talks to a HMS service of version 1.2 or lower, the following error will occur:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: org.apache.thrift.TApplicationException: Invalid method name: 'get_all_functions'\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.getAllFunctions(Hive.java:3897)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.reloadFunctions(Hive.java:248)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.registerAllFunctionsOnce(Hive.java:231)\r\n        ... 96 more\r\nCaused by: org.apache.thrift.TApplicationException: Invalid method name: 'get_all_functions'\r\n        at org.apache.thrift.TServiceClient.receiveBase(TServiceClient.java:79)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.ThriftHiveMetastore$Client.recv_get_all_functions(ThriftHiveMetastore.java:3845)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.ThriftHiveMetastore$Client.get_all_functions(ThriftHiveMetastore.java:3833)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `get_all_functions` is called only when `doRegisterAllFns` is set to true:\r\n```java\r\n  private Hive(HiveConf c, boolean doRegisterAllFns) throws HiveException {\r\n    conf = c;\r\n    if (doRegisterAllFns) {\r\n      registerAllFunctionsOnce();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhat this does is to register all Hive permanent functions defined in HMS in Hive's `FunctionRegistry` class, via iterating through results from `get_all_functions`. To Spark, this seems unnecessary as it loads Hive permanent (not built-in) UDF via directly calling the HMS API, i.e., `get_function`. The `FunctionRegistry` is only used in loading Hive's built-in function that is not supported by Spark. At this time, it only applies to `histogram_numeric`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes with this fix Spark now should be able to talk to HMS server with Hive 1.2.x and lower (with HIVE-24608 too)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually started a HMS server of Hive version 1.2.2, with patched Hive 2.3.8 using HIVE-24608. Without the PR it failed with the above exception. With the PR the error disappeared and I can successfully perform common operations such as create table, create database, list tables, etc.","created_at":"2021-05-07T22:17:10Z","updated_at":"2021-05-08T04:05:50Z","closed_at":"2021-05-08T00:41:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ad132a805f77f203b321a3081ce2ca993e8f2ac5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1f88641650a951de2f698effe3886b4b236a5a5f","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-35321-3.0","ref":"SPARK-35321-3.0","sha":"1f88641650a951de2f698effe3886b4b236a5a5f","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

It's kind of necessary as we need to do many things to identify the aggregate function and push it down to the aggregate node: resolve columns as if they are in the aggregate node, resolve functions, apply type coercion, etc. However, this is overly complicated and it's hard to fully understand how the resolution is done there. It also leads to hacks such as the [char/varchar hack](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.1.2/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala#L2396-L2401), [subquery hack](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.1.2/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala#L2274-L2277), [grouping function hack](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.1.2/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala#L2465-L2467), etc.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies the `ResolveAggregateFunctions` rule and clarifies the resolution logic. To resolve aggregate functions/grouping columns in HAVING, ORDER BY and `df.where`, we expand the aggregate node below to output these required aggregate functions/grouping columns. In details, when resolving an expression from the parent of an aggregate node:\r\n1. try to resolve columns with `agg.child` and wrap the result with `TempResolvedColumn`.\r\n2. try to resolve subqueries with `agg.child`\r\n3. if the expression is not resolved, return it and wait for other rules to resolve it, such as resolve functions, type coercions, etc.\r\n4. if the expression is resolved, we transform it and push aggregate functions/grouping columns into the aggregate node below.\r\n4.1 the expression may already present in `agg.aggregateExpressions`, we can simply replace the expression with attr ref.\r\n4.2 if a `TempResolvedColumn` is neither inside an aggregate function, or wrap a grouping column, turn it back to an `UnresolvedAttribute`\r\n5. after the main resolution batch, remove all `TempResolvedColumn` and turn them back to `UnresolvedAttribute`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe PR is proposed for **pandas APIs on Spark**, in order to separate arithmetic operations shown as below into data-type-based structures.\r\n`__add__, __sub__, __mul__, __truediv__, __floordiv__, __pow__, __mod__,\r\n__radd__, __rsub__, __rmul__, __rtruediv__, __rfloordiv__, __rpow__,__rmod__`\r\n\r\nDataTypeOps and subclasses are introduced.\r\n\r\nThe existing behaviors of each arithmetic operation should be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the same arithmetic operation of all data types is defined in one function, so it’s difficult to extend the behavior change based on the data types. \r\n\r\nIntroducing DataTypeOps would be the foundation for [pandas APIs on Spark: Separate basic operations into data type based structures.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MS6xK0hETYmrcl5b9pX5lgV4FmGVfpmcSKq--_oQlc/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nTests are introduced under pyspark.pandas.tests.data_type_ops. One test file per DataTypeOps class.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-07T16:28:14Z","updated_at":"2021-05-19T23:43:58Z","closed_at":"2021-05-19T22:05:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42b7387f978c11f01beff4a9787f5229846210be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32469/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32469/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32469/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9cfb617919318b646c071cb19157ffabab1fe14b","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:datatypeop_arith","ref":"datatypeop_arith","sha":"9cfb617919318b646c071cb19157ffabab1fe14b","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore this PR. We use `repartition` to avoid generating small files. But it still generates `spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.minPartitionNum` number of files, which may leads to exceeding the directory item limitation:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException(org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocol.FSLimitException$MaxDirectoryItemsExceededException): The directory item limit of /path/to/table is exceeded: limit=1048576 items=1048576\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR. We can avoid generating small files:\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE target_tbl SELECT /*+ REPARTITION */ * FROM

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new job in GitHub Actions to check the output of TPC-DS queries.\r\n\r\nNOTE: To generate TPC-DS table data in GA jobs, this PR includes generator code implemented in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32243 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32460.\r\n\r\nThis is the backport PR of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31886.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere are some cases where we noticed runtime-realted bugs after merging commits (e.g. .SPARK-33822). Therefore, I think it is worth adding a new job in GitHub Actions to check query output of TPC-DS (sf=1).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThe new test added.","created_at":"2021-05-07T01:27:43Z","updated_at":"2021-05-08T23:21:06Z","closed_at":"2021-05-08T21:45:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"422b02f465f97b815dddd19b3cd99030e7b8d41d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/673323b55e86d130d4646695e90ce4f28ed5fd84","head":{"label":"maropu:TPCDSQUeryTestSuite-Branch3.1","ref":"TPCDSQUeryTestSuite-Branch3.1","sha":"673323b55e86d130d4646695e90ce4f28ed5fd84","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

To check history logs, we usually collect pod logs to third-party logging services, which can be accessed by urls. To show log urls on ui,  we can set env prefixed with 'SPARK_LOG_URL_' for executors. But for driver, there is no way to show log urls by setting env. \r\n\r\nThis pr use 'SPARK_DRIVER_LOG_URL_' as env prefix for getting driver log urls by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo show driver log urls on ui by setting env prefixed with 'SPARK_DRIVER_LOG_URL_'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to bump up the janino version from 3.0.16 to v3.1.4.\r\nThe major changes of this upgrade are as follows:\r\n - Fixed issue #131: Janino 3.1.2 is 10x slower than 3.0.11: The Compiler's IClassLoader was initialized way too eagerly, thus lots of classes were loaded from the class path, which is very slow.\r\n - Improved the encoding of stack map frames according to JVMS11 4.7.4: Previously, only \"full_frame\"s were generated.\r\n - Fixed issue #107: Janino requires \"org.codehaus.commons.compiler.io\", but commons-compiler does not export this package\r\n - Fixed the promotion of the array access index expression (see JLS7 15.13 Array Access Expressions).\r\n\r\nFor all the changes, please see the change log: http://janino-compiler.github.io/janino/changelog.html\r\n\r\nNOTE1: I've checked that there is no obvious performance regression. For all the data, see a link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srxT9CioGQg1fLKM3Uo8z1sTzgCsMj4pg6JzpdcG6VU/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nNOTE2: We upgraded janino to 3.1.2 (#27860) once before, but the commit had been reverted in #29495 because of the correctness issue. Recently, #32374 had checked if Spark could land on v3.1.3 or not, but a new bug was found there. These known issues has been fixed in v3.1.4 by following PRs:\r\n - janino-compiler/janino#145\r\n - janino-compiler/janino#146\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\njanino v3.0.X  is no longer maintained.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nGA

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to filter out TPCDS v1.4 q6 and q75 in `TPCDSQueryTestSuite`.\r\n\r\nI saw`TPCDSQueryTestSuite` failed nondeterministically because output row orders were different with those in the golden files. For example, the failure in the GA job, https://github.com/linhongliu-db/spark/runs/2507928605?check_suite_focus=true, happened because the `tpcds/q6.sql` query output rows were only sorted by `cnt`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a0c76a8755a148e2bd774edcda12fe20f2f38c75/sql/core/src/test/resources/tpcds/q6.sql#L20\r\nActually, `tpcds/q6.sql`  and `tpcds-v2.7.0/q6.sql` are almost the same and the only difference is that `tpcds-v2.7.0/q6.sql` sorts both `cnt` and `a.ca_state`:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a0c76a8755a148e2bd774edcda12fe20f2f38c75/sql/core/src/test/resources/tpcds-v2.7.0/q6.sql#L22\r\nSo, I think it's okay just to test `tpcds-v2.7.0/q6.sql` in this case (q75 has the same issue).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor stable testing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nGA

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR upgrades Jersey to 2.34.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCVE-2021-28168, a local information disclosure vulnerability, is reported (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-28168).\r\nSpark 3.1.1, 3.0.2 and 3.2.0 use an affected version 2.30.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt's not clear how much the impact is but Spark uses an affected version of Jersey so I think it's better to upgrade it just in case.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUse runtime statistics to decide if we can convert join to shuffled hash join.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUse AQE runtime statistics to decide if we can use shuffled hash join instead of sort merge join. Currently, the formula of shuffled hash join selection dose not work due to the dymanic shuffle partition number.\r\n\r\nAdd a new config `spark.sql.adaptive.shuffledHashJoinLocalMapThreshold` to decide if join can be converted to shuffled hash join safely.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, add a new config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd new test.","created_at":"2021-05-06T05:34:54Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T12:28:09Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T02:37:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f14f0fdaff17a2f539fbc8dcb07282feadf0e4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32450/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32450/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32450/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e8283a21d15bf5c3e79f2d134640838faf5480e2","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-35282","ref":"SPARK-35282","sha":"e8283a21d15bf5c3e79f2d134640838faf5480e2","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes the unionByName with null filling logic to append new nested struct fields from the right side of the union to the schema versus sorting fields alphabetically. It removes the need to use UpdateField expressions, and just directly projects new nested structs from each side of the union with the correct schema. This changes the union'd schema from being alphabetically sorted previously to now \"left dominant\", where the fields from the left side of the union are included and then the missing ones from the right are added in the same order found originally.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a resolver to the StructType merging to handle case insensitivity, as the resulting union logical and physical expressions using StructType.merge to provide the resulting schema of the union.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCertain nested structs would cause unionByName with null filling to error out due to part of the logic for rewriting the expression tree to sort the structs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nShouldn't other than fixing certain cases that caused errors. I don't know if adding the resolver to the StructType merging has any unintended side effects, so definitely would like some thoughts on that. Also the order of the StructFields is slightly different now, though that shouldn't have too much of an effect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow up to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32032#discussion_r620928086. Basically, `children`/`innerChildren` should be mutually exclusive for `AlterViewAsCommand` and `CreateViewCommand`, which extend `AnalysisOnlyCommand`. Otherwise, there could be an issue in the `EXPLAIN` command. Currently, this is not an issue, because these commands will be analyzed (children will always be empty) when the `EXPLAIN` command is run.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo be future-proof where these commands are directly used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

As result, when Spark 3.x talks to a HMS service of version 1.2 or lower, the following error will occur:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: org.apache.thrift.TApplicationException: Invalid method name: 'get_all_functions'\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.getAllFunctions(Hive.java:3897)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.reloadFunctions(Hive.java:248)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Hive.registerAllFunctionsOnce(Hive.java:231)\r\n        ... 96 more\r\nCaused by: org.apache.thrift.TApplicationException: Invalid method name: 'get_all_functions'\r\n        at org.apache.thrift.TServiceClient.receiveBase(TServiceClient.java:79)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.ThriftHiveMetastore$Client.recv_get_all_functions(ThriftHiveMetastore.java:3845)\r\n        at org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.ThriftHiveMetastore$Client.get_all_functions(ThriftHiveMetastore.java:3833)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `get_all_functions` is called only when `doRegisterAllFns` is set to true:\r\n```java\r\n  private Hive(HiveConf c, boolean doRegisterAllFns) throws HiveException {\r\n    conf = c;\r\n    if (doRegisterAllFns) {\r\n      registerAllFunctionsOnce();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhat this does is to register all Hive permanent functions defined in HMS in Hive's `FunctionRegistry` class, via iterating through results from `get_all_functions`. To Spark, this seems unnecessary as it loads Hive permanent (not built-in) UDF via directly calling the HMS API, i.e., `get_function`. The `FunctionRegistry` is only used in loading Hive's built-in function that is not supported by Spark. At this time, it only applies to `histogram_numeric`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes with this fix Spark now should be able to talk to HMS server with Hive 1.2.x and lower (with HIVE-24608 too)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually started a HMS server of Hive version 1.2.2, with patched Hive 2.3.8 using HIVE-24608.
