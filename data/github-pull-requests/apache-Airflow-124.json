working through an [example](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/kubepod-operator#example-use-the-kubernetespodoperator-with-xcoms) of doing XComs with the KubernetesPodOperator, the `env_vars` attribute is used to pass templated values into the kubernetes pod. The `@task.decorator` uses the `_KubernetesDecoratedOperator` class in [this](https://github.com/fletchjeff/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/decorators/kubernetes.py) file. It overrides the `template_fields` and excludes `env_vars` from being rendered. \r\n\r\nGiven that `env_vars` seems to be the standard approach passing XComs into a kubernetes pod, I think this should be enabled. Its a quite a simple change.\r\n\r\nThis line https://github.com/fletchjeff/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/decorators/kubernetes.py#L60\r\n\r\ngoes from:\r\n\r\n`template_fields:

release management and shell Breeze command on Mac should be now quite a bit faster:\r\n\r\n1) The .pyc and __pycache__ are now deleted at entry of shell\r\n   command and when docker commands are run - on the host. This\r\n   will not remove all files sometimes - if they are root owned\r\n   but we print warning in this case and suggest to use the\r\n   `breeze ci fix-ownership` command\r\n\r\n2) When preparing packages we are now using rsync rather than\r\n   removing/copying sources. This should be way faster even on\r\n   Mounted Mac system.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

Dockerfile.ci had a bug - installation of docker CLI for ARM images was done with the x86 docker. This caused the binary to be ~15 slower on emulated devices but it also seemed to break the cache for the ARM images (or so it seems).\r\n\r\nThis change fixes this in two ways:\r\n\r\n1) the docker installation happens inside the scripts which are\r\n   shared between the PROD and CI image - this means that the\r\n   docker binary should be available in PROD and CI image.\r\n\r\n2) the installation picks the right binary, depending on the\r\n   platform and likely not causing cache invalidation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Now, only `echo` output goes to XCOM's return_value key. And in case of failure nothing being passed to return_value. So in a dag we don't know what specific code is returned.\r\n\r\n**What's done:**\r\nIn [SSHOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/ssh/operators/ssh.py#L36), add XCOM key **ssh_exit**.\r\nTask succeeded - ssh_exit set to 0. `echo` stuff still passed to return_value.\r\nTask failed - ssh_exit stores the code which was retrived from the ssh session.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSSHOperator(\r\n        command=\"pwd\",\r\n        dag=dag)\r\n\r\nSSHOperator(\r\n        command=\"pwd && exit 123\",\r\n        dag=dag)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![изображение](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12990695/198853755-312952e7-c0b2-424e-bbaa-5599173781ad.png)\r\n\r\n**P.S.**  I could imagine the alternative possible scenario - not to introduce a new XCOM key and just replace the return_value content, i.e. skip all other text output and just pass the ssh exit code there.\r\nBut my first approach does not reduce the functionality and the second one does. So I prefered the first.","created_at":"2022-10-29T22:14:10Z","updated_at":"2022-12-04T17:35:45Z","closed_at":"2022-12-04T17:35:42Z","merged_at":"2022-12-04T17:35:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b107e6f504732715702ea65e77986c2d42f5d61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/27370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/27370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/27370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/ea5afa96155c52efff4201d085fdf17caf9fcb76","head":{"label":"kolfild26:ssh_exit_code","ref":"ssh_exit_code","sha":"ea5afa96155c52efff4201d085fdf17caf9fcb76","user":{"login":"kolfild26","id":12990695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTkwNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12990695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolfild26","html_url":"https://github.com/kolfild26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolfild26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolfild26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolfild26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolfild26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolfild26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolfild26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolfild26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolfild26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolfild26/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"1fe10b26444258435881b810fbe5a4b73ddb32ba","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

been long waiting for an opportunity to simplify our\r\nworkflows by extracting some steps of the workflow and waiting\r\nfor something like yaml anchor supoprt... But the solution was\r\nunder our noses for quite some time.\r\n\r\nNo idea how I missed that - since August 2021 we should be\r\nable to use composite actions to simplify our GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation I have is that I have not connected two\r\nfacts:\r\n\r\n* you can have composite actions defined as separate workflows you\r\n  can use as step in your Job\r\n\r\n* the documentation for composite actions does not mention the\r\n  case that your action can be INSIDE your repository. All the\r\n  examples refer to an action defined in ANOTHER repository.\r\n  That made it confusing to understand that you can actually do\r\n  it all as an action inside your repo.\r\n\r\nLet me rectify the mistake and extract some of the common yaml\r\nentries one-by-one - first is Installing Breeze which is pretty\r\ncommon and most of the jobs use it.\r\n\r\nThis one will be followed up with some other jobs simplified in\r\nthe same matter.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

some time, caching in pre-commits was broken and some of the pre-commit installation was unnecessary. There were few missing or mis-sequenced steps when the CI cache was declered and it made regular PRs us a bit (1-2 minutes) longer time for pre-commit setup than it was needed. In case of image building, there is no need to setup all pre-commits because only one pre-commit is needed (update-generated dependencies) - instead we can simply install rich and yaml locally and run the pre-comit script directly.\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans it up.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

some time, caching in pre-commits was broken and some of the pre-commit installation was unnecessary. There were few missing or mis-sequenced steps when the CI cache was declered and it made regular PRs us a bit (1-2 minutes) longer time for pre-commit setup than it was needed. In case of image building, there is no need to setup all pre-commits because only one pre-commit is needed (update-generated dependencies) - instead we can simply install rich and yaml locally and run the pre-comit script directly.\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans it up.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#27191 change introduced globally shareable flags for verbose and dry-run flags in Breeze however it also changed behaviour of the \"false\" string passed by VERBOSE/DRY_RUN env variables and crashed breeze when one of those variables was set to empty string.\r\n\r\nAs a result CI's \"VERBOSE\" \"false\" flag in static checks was treated as \"truthy\" and static checks output contained a lot of noise from non-failing static checks.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that \"convert\" method of click can also take \"strings\" as parameter because coertion of env variables happens inside the convert method (which mkes sense if you think about it) so the convert method should accept both string and target type values, This is explained in convert method docs but I missed it :(.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes both problems by introducing explicit coertion of the variables from all kinds of string values - both when the flags are parsed but also before (sometimes we need verbose flag from variable (when we run breeze in scripts) even before the flag is actually parsed by click so additionally to coercing the flag, we also pre-emptively run the same coertion when importing the \"shared_options\" module.\r\n\r\nAlso just for the sake of it, we accept all kinds of truth-y, falsy strings now - true/false/yes/no/t/f/y/n in all kinds of casing and shortcuts.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for

from version 10.5.3 to version 12.1.2 of the bitnami/postgresql chart. This version changes the name of the username and password variables, so I've changed those here as well. Version 10.5.3 is over a year old and a lot of new features have been added since then.\r\n\r\nI also updated the dependency for bitnami/postgresql listed in the `Chart.yaml` to point at bitnami's chart repo. This means you can just change the version of the chart in `Chart.yaml` and then run `helm dependency update` and it will fetch that version for you and place the `.tgz` file in the `charts` dir and update the `Chart.lock`\r\n\r\nCloses:

\"Test git clone on Windows\" job is always run on GitHub\r\nPublic runners (we have no self-hosted windows runners).

But for\r\nself-hosted runners it might introduce unnecessary \"hold\" on\r\ncomplete status.\r\n\r\nThis should be enough to detect any problems - we will see it\r\nfailing in user's PRs and will be able to fix it, while it will\r\nnot block PRs of commiters and \"canary\" builds from completing\r\nwhen the Public Job Queue gets busy.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
