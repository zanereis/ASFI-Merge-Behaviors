operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR refines the scripts to execute tests under QEMU and facilitates usage and debug by providing a container with a fallback shell into the ARM VM.\r\n\r\nImproves documentation and usability.\r\n\r\nThe provided infrastructure is now refined and in a state that can enable other developers to test, debug and diagnose problems in ARM using QEMU.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-31T19:15:59Z","updated_at":"2018-11-02T16:53:47Z","closed_at":"2018-11-02T16:53:47Z","merged_at":"2018-11-02T16:53:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"b78265bac0dc47c39085184023174be1d40fb172","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nRefactor L2_normalization for speed up. Before this change, on skx-8180,  L2_normalization will take 8372 ms in ssd-vgg16 for bs=1, num_batch=1000. After adopting this change, L2_normalization only takes 372ms for same work load.\r\n\r\nCurrent unit test can cover all changes in this PR.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

Description ##\r\nThis PR creates a scala packageTest utility to run the full test suite against any mxnet jar.  This can be used to verify that the packages produced for release and as part of the ci/cd run correctly on various environments (16.04, 18.04, centOS, amazon linux, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n@lanking520 @nswamy @andrewfayres @yzhliu

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-10-30T21:40:15Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T20:52:09Z","closed_at":"2018-10-31T18:16:45Z","merged_at":"2018-10-31T18:16:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"49e6a7e40691936e533f7cf16848b10c025e4e75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nPreviously, the value of bulk_size in struct BulkStatus of ThreadedEngine was not reset to its original one if there is exception thrown when executing StaticForward/DynamicForward for CachedOp. This causes another test (test_operator_gpu.test_incorrect_gpu) to fail if we add hybridize call in test_gluon_rnn.test_layer_fill_shape. We fix this by adding a try-catch block and reset the bulk_size in case of exception when executing CachedOp::StaticForward/DynamicForward.

version\r\n- Replaced BagOfWordRandomProjection with Gluon version, though it really should only be used in very specific cases, added warning about that in the notebook and used embedding + lstm

Description ##\r\nThis PR introduces Symbol.random and NDArray.random modules in scala API.\r\nThis work is a further refactoring of code generation + introduction of Random module.\r\n\r\nFunctions in random module are generic and accept the following \"union types\": `SymbolOrValue`, and `NDArrayOrValue`. See https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/704ab6030c9803ac70d2726618885cef323a4420/scala-package/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/mxnet/Base.scala#L158-L171\r\n\r\nThis allow this kind of calls:\r\n```\r\n    // no need to import anything special, or any implicit\r\n    val lam = Symbol.Variable(\"lam\")\r\n    val rnd = Symbol.random.poisson(lam = Some(lam), shape = Some(Shape(2, 2)))\r\n    val rnd2 = Symbol.random.poisson(lam = Some(1f), shape = Some(Shape(2, 2)))\r\n```\r\nFor multi argument functions, mixing types of params is not allowed (fails at compile time).\r\n\r\nThe code to generate Random module is more hacky than the rest, due to some discrepancies (eg. `sample_normal` vs `random_normal`). I tried to isolate that as much as possible in dedicated objects and mixin. \r\n\r\nFollowing @zachgk comment in the previous PR, I also tried to organise code generation in a way that the essential of function implementations is as much as possible readable and linear.\r\n\r\nLast thing to discuss is: should we turn off function generation of random stuff in Symbol and NDArray\r\n(eg Symbol.sample_exponential)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Symbol.random api generated by macros\r\n- NDArray.random api generated by macros\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This is a continuation of work started in PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12489\r\n- Related:

Description ##\r\nThis PR is part of a larger work to introduce Symbol.random and NDArray.random modules in scala API.\r\nThis PR is a refactoring of code-generation (APIDocGenerator, NDArrayMacro, SymbolMacro) to avoid duplication of similar logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This is a continuation of work started in PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12489\r\n- Work has been separated in 2 PRs to ease review. When merged, I'll rebase the 2nd one (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13039)\r\n- This PR does not introduce any new functionality\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-30T14:35:58Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T17:55:46Z","closed_at":"2018-11-05T17:55:45Z","merged_at":"2018-11-05T17:55:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"53c5a72c1f28dad284b7f6d7699cca6f0eec776a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nTitle\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Do we plan to rename the file la_op-inline.h\r\nSince all the other related files are

Description ##\r\nThe PR is to fix an error of quantize_graph pass which can't handle multiple outputs (like split op followd by convolution or fullyconnected) correctly. The current implementation is only quantizing for the first outputs but not the rest ones. In fact, for the case with multiple outputs from a single node, it requires to quantize separately for each output but not only the first one.\r\n\r\nCheck the attachment for the symbols before and after the fix.\r\n* symbols from current implementation: [original_split_quantize.pdf](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/files/2524495/original_split_quantize.pdf)\r\n* symbols from fixed version: [fixed_split_quantize.pdf](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/files/2524494/fixed_split_quantize.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @ZhennanQin

Description ##\r\nStart a migration of this https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/image/image.html to Scala world. Tested locally on my Mac and it's been much simpler to load the image to NDArray. It allows Scala and all other JVM language to call OpenCV package. It is expected to beat the performance with JavaIO\r\n\r\nHere is the current exposed functions:\r\n\r\nHere is the exposed OpenCV function:\r\n- `imdecode`: Decode a byte array image into NDArray. Really helpful to allow memory loading for fast inference.\r\n- `imread`: Read image from a file and convert it into NDArray\r\n- `imresize`: Resize an image\r\n- `imCopyMakeBorder`: It used to draw the border for the image. Used to deal with the image size too small and you would like to apply additional pixels to the image\r\n\r\nIn order to make these functions more Java-friendly, I created some extended functions for that:\r\n- `imDecode`: Take input as a `byte []` or `InputStream`\r\n- `imDecodeURL`: Take input as URL and do socket buffer reading. (Thanks @frankfliu to help me understand the context behind it)\r\n- `fixedCrop`: Crop the NDArray image to a fixed size\r\n- `toImage`: convert and NDArray to image (yes, I am not try to sell my image :) @gigasquid)\r\n\r\nThese functions can be called from Imperative invoke and can be generated. The reason I haven't generate those is because the generated function is not very user-friendly and I need to change some comments field to make something clear.\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu \r\n\r\n##

Description ##\r\nSome of the CUDNN convolution algorithms are non-deterministic (see issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11341). This PR adds an env variable to enforce determinism in the convolution operators. If set to true, only deterministic CUDNN algorithms will be used. If no deterministic algorithm is available, MXNet will error out.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] new environment variable added: MXNET_ENFORCE_DETERMINISM (default false)\r\n- [x] CUDNN covolution, deconvolution, max pooling operators\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- still need to add a test to verify determinism.","created_at":"2018-10-26T23:56:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-15T05:26:12Z","closed_at":"2018-10-30T20:21:36Z","merged_at":"2018-10-30T20:21:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b787d3cf37a994e51a3420149c6bbd48ca09c8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nTwo batch norm unit tests were failing and were disabled.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12715\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12767\r\nRe-enable them as the fix from https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12804 is merged\r\n \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nenabled `test_slice_batchnorm` and `test_slice_batchnorm_reshape_batchnorm`\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-26T18:36:11Z","updated_at":"2018-10-27T10:34:54Z","closed_at":"2018-10-27T10:34:54Z","merged_at":"2018-10-27T10:34:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f6d224679bb8ce28ea8eff1fca4bcab30125764","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":850777570,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTA3Nzc1NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CUDA","name":"CUDA","color":"fc235d","default":false,"description":""},{"id":977504354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzc1MDQzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Disabled%20test","name":"Disabled

Description ##\r\nAdding unit test for MKLDNN FullyConnected operator. The test compares the output of MKLDNN integrated operator to the one without MKLDNN support.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-1099], where 1099 refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Unit test added for MKLDNN FullyConnected Operator\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- OpReqType supported: WriteTo\r\n- Works for all valid input dimensions\r\n- Both forward and backward operator have MKLDNN support\r\n- @azai91 please

Description ##\r\nWhen using C++-based iterators, it's important that only a single batch is referenced at a time. Because C++ iterators are exposed to the Python code through a C API, there is no concept of reference counting. Hence, typically C++ iterators will deallocate a batch when next() is called on them. So, we need to make sure the Python code only references a single batch at a time, otherwise the Python code will attempt to access freed memory, resulting in either (a) garbage accuracy or (b) a segmentation fault.\r\n\r\nThe test passes with the latest mxnet build. I verified it failed on previous releases, such as mxnet==1.2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- No feature changes.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nWe encountered an issue with garbage accuracy on an older MXNet release with our custom C++ iterators and saw that it was fixed in the latest master, but without a regression test. So, here I have implemented such a regression test.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-25T18:11:34Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T17:26:20Z","closed_at":"2018-11-13T17:26:20Z","merged_at":"2018-11-13T17:26:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"1cc86296748441629a59fed1d211593c31818f63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":273991937,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzM5OTE5Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/C++","name":"C++","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Related

Description ##\r\nThis is a documentation PR.\r\n\r\nI updated the Clojure REPL-based tutorials (e.g. *contrib/clojure-package/examples/tutorial/src/tutorial/module.clj*) to match their online/markdown versions (e.g. [Module API](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/clojure/module.html)). This will allow people to more easily switch back and forth from the online and REPL versions of the same tutorial.\r\n\r\nThis primarily involved standardizing section headings to four-semicoloned comments with an extra line of whitespace above them, wrapping long lines, and adding namespace docstrings. In the Symbol tutorial I removed a duplicated section and some sections that seem to be partially copied from the [basic tutorial](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/basic/symbol.html), but which did not seem to make sense out of that context. (I would like to circle back in a later PR to completely translate that tutorial to Clojure.)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Clojure Module API tutorial\r\n- [x] Clojure KVStore API tutorial\r\n- [x] Clojure NDArray API tutorial\r\n- [x] Clojure Symbol API tutorial\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nI fixed three small .clj-tutorial-adjacent issues in the course of this PR:\r\n - deleted a duplicated section in the online/markdown docs (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commit/b846d634d5b3908ef32ad5e52c208d9dcf145b37)\r\n - fixed a code-block typo in the online docs (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/commit/8597817d727fcfe83af89255b0cde21e2f8ac390)\r\n - I changed the Maven dependency that the tutorials run on from the (unreleased and therefore unusable-without-extra-steps) version 1.3.1-SNAPSHOT of coordinates which don't seem to exist to 1.3.0 of coordinates that are referenced in [the new README](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12881)

Description ##\r\nOn Linux x64, `str(numpy.longlong)` is \"<class 'numpy.int64'>\", however `numpy.longlong != numpy.int64`.\r\nTheir in-build numpy types are different.\r\n\r\n`np.int64 == np.longlong` is True on Windows, False on Linux.\r\n`np.dtype(np.longlong).char` is 'q' on Windows x64 and Linux x64.\r\n`np.dtype(np.int64).char` is 'q' on Windows x64, 'l' on Linux x64.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the C types of `np.longlong` and `np.int64` are the same.\r\n\r\nFor the following code,\r\n```python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport numpy as np\r\na = mx.nd.array([1,2,3], dtype=np.longlong)\r\nprint (a, a.dtype)\r\n```\r\nMXNet will raise the exception:\r\n```\r\n  File \"/home/wkcn/proj/incubator-mxnet/python/mxnet/ndarray/ndarray.py\", line 139, in _new_alloc_handle\r\n    ctypes.c_int(int(_DTYPE_NP_TO_MX[np.dtype(dtype).type])),\r\nKeyError: <type 'numpy.int64'>\r\n```\r\nAnd there is an issue #12843 , SciPy returns a ndarray whose type is `np.longlong`, so MXNet raises a exception.\r\n\r\nI use `np.dtype(data_type).name` to get the name of C type to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nAdding in Javadocs for all the new java api classes. I looked at the resulting docs after rebuilding and it seems to look as expected. Most of these are the same as the docs in the Scala code. I removed the references to default values and made other changes for places that I saw them.\r\n\r\n@piyushghai @lanking520 @nswamy \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-24T19:40:42Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T23:52:20Z","closed_at":"2018-10-26T23:52:20Z","merged_at":"2018-10-26T23:52:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"743301ccfe53ae5bee7debc4b3486f080a45291f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\n\r\nThe row sparse matrix, which usually represents weights in LR, may get denser and denser in the training. The current implementation sequentially search the matched indices. This change fully utilize the sorted indices by binary search the index. \r\n\r\nHere is a simple script to test the perf change. The script intentionally makes the row sparse matrix quite dense to simulate the effects of half-dense matrix in the training.  Change `b` to larger number (e.g. 28) and the speedup is even larger (50x - 70x)\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nimport argparse\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport time\r\n\r\n\r\nparser =

Description ##\r\nAdd unit tests to ensure ResourceScope works in Java and to also demonstrate an example use-case.\r\n\r\nIt works by using try-with-resources technique in Java.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are

Description ##\r\nThis PR indents to update the 3rdparty MKL-DNN denpendency to latest master branch. It will help to address #12862 #12891 #12265 .\r\n\r\nAlso, MKL-DNN introduced new padded formats and may require more memory for computation than the actual input/output tensor size. So convolution and deconvolution code are changed to choose proper kernel accordingly.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable

comments\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-23T23:28:48Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T18:14:45Z","closed_at":"2018-12-10T18:14:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45defee1729b67aa29b8188557881176d130a929","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":890967059,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4OTA5NjcwNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/ONNX","name":"ONNX","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nEnable clang tidy on CUDA code\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-23T23:09:33Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T01:34:45Z","closed_at":"2019-01-16T01:34:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8e5c011d05959ea013299b622a66249b01a795c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":850777570,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTA3Nzc1NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CUDA","name":"CUDA","color":"fc235d","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe PR includes an example that demonstrates the inference workflow using C++ API.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [y] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [y] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [y] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [y] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\nThe example demonstrates how to load the pre-trained model and associated parameter files.\r\nThe model and parameter files can be specified as command line arguments.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-23T18:58:58Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T00:45:10Z","closed_at":"2018-11-16T00:40:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"899d743afc5202428ed27389fa803b4309602cf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4","avatar_url":"https

Description ##\r\n1. Parallelize NDArray::Copy<cpu, cpu> OP by OpenMP when data size bigger than MXNET_CPU_PARALLEL_COPY_SIZE.\r\n2. introduce the environment variable named: MXNET_CPU_PARALLEL_COPY_SIZE (default 200,000) . When data size is bigger than this threshold, NDArray::Copy is implemented by OpenMP with the Recommended OMP Thread Count, otherwise implemented by default.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nWe are optimizing [Sockeye](https://github.com/awslabs/sockeye)'s performance on CPU and found that the CopyCPU2CPU operation take too much time, probably accounting for 14% of the overall time (detail data as below). So we parallelized NDArray::Copy<cpu, cpu> operator. \r\n\r\nAs far as i know, NDArray::Copy<cpu, cpu> is called in the front-end by those functions: **nd.copy(), nd.copyto(), nd.asnumpy(), nd.array(),nd.ones(), nd.zeros()** . **Those functions can gain 2-14 times speedup when data size is range from 20000 to 2e8.  And Sockeye's perf increased from 17.10 sent/sec to 19.19 sent/sec on CPU inference, CopyCPU2CPU time overhead dropped from 14.68% to 2.3%.**  the detail data as below.\r\n\r\nthe logs and scripts are

Description ##\r\nAs stated in issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11639, some big numbers cannot be assigned correctly with ndarray. The root cause is due to the use of float32 as value holder for input. This change used a double data type to fix the precision loss.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-10-23T06:41:21Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T22:48:59Z","closed_at":"2018-10-25T22:14:43Z","merged_at":"2018-10-25T22:14:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffe551e7c3ad3accbac1d78b53990a544e1331de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAdded support for exporting Instance Normalization, Shape to ONNX\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Added export in _op_translations.py\r\n- Added test in onnx_backend_test.py\r\n- Created a common backend_rep.py. Removed python-pytest/onnx/export/backend_rep.py and python-pytest/onnx/import/mxnet_backend_rep.py\r\n- In the PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12633, changes were made to use different bind method based on batch sizes, in ONNX import. Using sym.bind by default.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- All tests in onnx_backend_test and mxnet_backend_test pass\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-23T00:49:08Z","updated_at":"2018-12-01T07:05:52Z","closed_at":"2018-12-01T07:05:52Z","merged_at":"2018-12-01T07:05:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"77510d7b37a5da80bd43b3f1c21a39a52163dae8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":890967059,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4OTA5NjcwNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/ONNX","name":"ONNX","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThe PR includes an example that demonstrates the inference workflow using C++ API.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [y] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [y] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [y] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [y] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\nThe example demonstrates how to load the pre-trained model and associated parameter files.\r\nThe model and parameter files can be specified as command line arguments.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-22T22:33:46Z","updated_at":"2018-10-23T18:59:45Z","closed_at":"2018-10-23T18:56:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38cdb22891a402c6c47ac9f59d89f10b44a30e67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAllows use of upper triangular matrices in the linalg operators potrf/potri/trmm/trsm. Usually all of these operators allow specification of whether we deal with lower or upper triangular matrices in BLAS/LAPACK. We haven't exposed this so far in MXNet and only supported lower triangular ones. But it turns out that there are indeed applications where you would like to use upper triangular ones directly. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable

Description ##\r\nTo easily evaluate the overall status on the performance diffs between the fused and unfused/stacked achieved on Gluon RNN API, this script can measure the  dummy-data based benchmarking on LSTM and GRU RNN cell, the input-shape can either be explictly specified, or a predefined input-shape list. (The selected input shaped referring to the [Deepbench](https://github.com/baidu-research/DeepBench)). \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nAdd a standalone python file benchmark_gluon_rnn.py under benchmark/python/gluon\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis script supports both gpu and cpu.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-21T09:13:23Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T19:25:41Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e40cb10a5edbf39355bb1fbedc713ff0a04cbb52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAdding Unittest for softmax operator with MKLDNN support. The test compares the output of MKLDNN integrated operator to the one without MKLDNN support.\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-1098], where 1098 refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add tests for MKLDNN softmax operator\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- backward Softmax does not have MKLDNN support\r\n- OpReqType supported: WriteTo, WriteInplace\r\n- @azai91 please review\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-19T23:41:29Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T06:26:37Z","closed_at":"2018-11-20T06:26:37Z","merged_at":"2018-11-20T06:26:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"cf6ae59058435fd2bfa0cbe5ceb1f9ce82e92b70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-19T20:19:42Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T16:17:35Z","closed_at":"2018-11-07T19:23:55Z","merged_at":"2018-11-07T19:23:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"466c488cfb93b3d50286809b7895f821fe885bf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":718413113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MTg0MTMxMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Example","name":"Example","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nEvery export function has code to get inputs, proc_nodes etc. Created a common function for this. Based on @zhreshold's suggestion in another PR.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Create a common function for getting node and attrs in ONNX export.\r\n- Created a helper function to create operator nodes that don't have any attributes\r\n- Stop convertor registration if onnx is not available\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- All tests in onnx_backend_test and mxnet_export_test pass.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-19T18:42:17Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T18:30:48Z","closed_at":"2018-11-01T18:30:48Z","merged_at":"2018-11-01T18:30:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"0bea50ec201d19cf393a2dce37d9a6b1625be144","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":890967059,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4OTA5NjcwNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/ONNX","name":"ONNX","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nFixes #12854 \r\n* This PR manually specifies members of the IO module so that the docs will render as expected. This is workaround in the docs to deal with a bug introduced in the Python code/structure since v1.3.0. See the comments for more info.\r\n\r\n* This PR also fixes another issue that may or may not be related. Cross references to same-named entities like `name`, `shape`, or `type` are confusing Sphinx and it seems to just link to whatever it last dealt with that has the same name, and not the current module. To fix this you have to be very specific. Don't use `type`, use `np.type` if that's what you want. Otherwise you might end up with `mxnet.kvstore.KVStore.type`. This is a [known Sphinx issue](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/4961), so it might be something we have to deal with for the time being.\r\n\r\nI mapped these to aliases, so the docs still have a shorthand reference. \r\n```\r\n.. _name: mxnet.symbol.Symbol.name\r\n.. _shape: mxnet.ndarray.NDArray.shape\r\n```\r\nSo you will see me use `name_` in the docstring, and that will link up to the `_name` alias for `mxnet.symbol.Symbol.name` that is defined at the end of the documentation page's rst code. This pattern is specified by [restructured text syntax](http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/doc/openalea/doc/_build/html/source/sphinx/rest_syntax.html#comments-and-aliases).\r\n\r\n**This is important for any future modules** - that they recognize this issue and make efforts to map the params and other elements.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Preview\r\n**To see the APIs populated:**\r\nGo to the 1.3.0 docs: http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/1.3.0/api/python/io/io.html#data-iterators\r\nThen switch to master. See how links are not there, and down in the API Reference none of those things are present.\r\nNow go to my preview: http://34.201.8.176/versions/1.3.1/api/python/io/io.html\r\n\r\n**To see the parameter mapping:**\r\nIt's broken on master and not even visible, but you can look at 1.3.0.\r\nhttp://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/1.3.0/api/python/io/io.html#mxnet.io.DataDesc.get_list\r\nNote that the mappings pretty much work, but type seems messed up because I doubt it is intended to be from `kvstore`. Now look at my preview:\r\nhttp://34.201.8.176/versions/1.3.1/api/python/io/io.html#mxnet.io.DataDesc.get_list\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nChanges that have come in since v1.3.0 have caused some havoc with Sphinx. This could be a bug in the Python code or maybe Sphinx needs things to be a certain way to function properly.\r\n* It can't distinguish between methods of the same name\r\n* It can't use automodule to fetch all members automatically \r\n**This means a lot of the docs are currently broken!** I ask that some more people take a look because it could be a minor change in the Python versus having to go through and update every single bit of docs and doc strings in each module.\r\n\r\nYou can see in this PR what had to be done just for one module. Note the `recordio` hasn't been touched and Sphinx renders the docs just fine.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12871/files#diff-4381272fd8fa032905b0785473077f5bL157\r\n\r\n## Follow up\r\nThere are 3 remaining docs build errors related to `io.py`:\r\n```\r\n/home/ubuntu/incubator-mxnet/python/mxnet/io/__init__.py:docstring of mxnet.io.NDArrayIter:5: WARNING: Title underline too short.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n----------\r\n/home/ubuntu/incubator-mxnet/python/mxnet/io/__init__.py:docstring of mxnet.io.NDArrayIter:5: SEVERE: Unexpected section title.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n----------\r\n/home/ubuntu/incubator-mxnet/docs/api/python/io/io.md:154: SEVERE: Duplicate ID: \"module-mxnet.io\".\r\n```\r\nI think that when folks work on the Python files and move them around like in subfolders like this, they must fix the docs prior to merging. That would have dealt with the first error WARNING and the second error SEVERE. As for the third error SEVERE, I think that the page structure of the docs must be changed to fix this. I tried a variety of workarounds like adding `:noindex:` but this just breaks the site. One solution would be to put these API outputs on separate pages. I'd like to eliminate all SEVERE errors so that we can put the docs build as part of CI, so that moving forward, people don't inadvertently break the docs with their PRs.","created_at":"2018-10-18T23:06:01Z","updated_at":"2018-10-24T23:24:49Z","closed_at":"2018-10-24T23:24:49Z","merged_at":"2018-10-24T23:24:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"50028e9586a56a3902837daf24fc5e0e9a90bacf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR
