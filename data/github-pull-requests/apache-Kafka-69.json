PR includes the changes to feature flags that were outlined in KIP-778.\r\n\r\n## Single finalized version level\r\n\r\nThe UpdateFeatures RPC and the FeatureLevelRecord were updated to remove the max version level. Other changes to the RPC from KIP-778 include:\r\n\r\n* Adding dry-run to the RPC so the controller can actually attempt the upgrade (rather than the client)\r\n* Introduce a upgrade type enum instead of \"allowDowngrade\" boolean\r\n\r\n## kafka-features.sh changes\r\n\r\nThis tool was overhauled in KIP-778 and now includes sub-commands.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/kafka-features.sh --help\r\nusage: kafka-features [-h] --bootstrap-server BOOTSTRAP_SERVER [--command-config COMMAND_CONFIG] {describe,upgrade,downgrade,disable} ...\r\n\r\nThis tool manages feature flags in Kafka.\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  {describe,upgrade,downgrade,disable}\r\n    describe             Describe one or more feature flags.\r\n    upgrade              Upgrade one or more feature flags.\r\n    downgrade            Upgrade one or more feature flags.\r\n    disable              Disable one or more feature flags. This is the same as downgrading the version to zero.\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help             show this help message and exit\r\n  --bootstrap-server BOOTSTRAP_SERVER\r\n                         A comma-separated list of host:port pairs to use for establishing the connection to the Kafka cluster.\r\n  --command-config COMMAND_CONFIG\r\n                         Property file containing configs to be passed to Admin Client.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHelp output from the \"upgrades\" sub-command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/kafka-features.sh upgrade --help\r\nusage: kafka-features --bootstrap-server BOOTSTRAP_SERVER upgrade [-h] [--feature FEATURE] [--version VERSION] [--release RELEASE] [--dry-run]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help             show this help message and exit\r\n  --dry-run              Perform a dry-run of this upgrade operation.\r\n\r\nUpgrade specific features:\r\n  --feature FEATURE      A feature flag to upgrade. This option may be repeated for upgrading multiple feature flags.\r\n  --version VERSION      The version to upgrade to.\r\n\r\nUpgrade to feature level defined for a given release:\r\n  --release

Background\r\nApache Kafka's rate-limiting algorithm uses a variation of fixed window algorithm where the duration of time window is controlled by two configurations: [quota.window.num](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_quota.window.num) and [quota.window.size.seconds](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_quota.window.size.seconds). When a client connection is received, rate of connections at that timestamp is calculated by observing the number of requests in the duration of time window defined using the configurable parameters. If the rate is above the acceptable threshold, the connection is made to wait for a duration calculated to ensure that when a connection is accepted, the overall rate should be less than (or equal to) acceptable threshold.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm has certain edge cases to handle rate calculation, such as the scenarios where 1\\ extended period of time when no connections are received or when 2\\ the rate calculation is occurring within the first ever window with no prior samples. Currently, both these cases are handled in the same manner. When no prior windows are available, an assumption is made that a prior window exists with 0 data points. This is an effective way to solve scenario 1 but it leads to problems for scenario 2. Let us demonstrate using examples.\r\n\r\nConsider configuration as `config.timeWindowMs() = 1s`, `config.samples() = 2`, max connection create rate = 30/s. A workload with a uniform rate of 40/s (1  connection per 25 ms) is started.\r\n\r\nRecord events (E) at timestamps:\r\nE1 = CurrentTimeStamp (T1)\r\nE2 = T1 + 25ms\r\nE3 = T1 + 50ms\r\n...\r\n...\r\nE30 = T1 + 725ms\r\n\r\nThe rate calculated as per the current algorithm (assuming a pre-existing window with 0 events) would be:\r\n- Rate T1 + 20ms = 1/ (prior window size + current window elapsed time) = 1 / (1 + 0.02) = 0.98 events per second\r\n- Rate calculated at T1 + 90ms = 3/1.09s = 2.75 events per second\r\n- Rate calculated at T1 + 730ms = 30/1.73s = 17.34 events per second\r\n\r\nNote that even after 30 events in that window, the rate is still set to ~17 events per second, which would prevent the throttling to kick-in. This would lead to a situation where the first window allows more requests than acceptable limit to pass through and thus, to compensate, the second window serves less traffic, the third window again increases the traffic and so on.... \r\nThis leads to an uneven distribution traffic across windows.\r\n\r\nNote that this un-even distribution is the primary cause of flakiness of `ConnectionQuotasTest.testListenerConnectionRateLimitWhenActualRateAboveLimit()`\r\n\r\n## Solution \r\nAs a solution, this PR distinguishes between the scenario 1 and 2 above. During the `Rate` calculation, windowSize method has been modified to treat the case of first window separately from the case when no traffic has been received in prior windows. For the first window, the windowSize is calculated as the overall length of first window. Using the new change, the above calculation changes to:\r\n\r\nThe rate calculated as per the new algorithm (assuming a pre-existing window with 0 events) would be:\r\n- Rate T1 + 20ms = 1/ (current window size) = 1 / 1 = 1 events per second\r\n- Rate calculated at T1 + 90ms = 3/1s = 3 events per second\r\n- Rate calculated at T1 + 730ms = 30/1s = 30 events per second\r\n\r\nNote how the throttling kicks-in as expected after 30 events and thus leading to a smoother distribution of traffic across windows.\r\n## Code Changes\r\n1. Modifications in `Rate.java#windowSize()` method to distinguish between scenario 1 and 2.\r\n2. Add a method `isCurrentSampleInFirstWindow` in \r\n3. Fix the `ConnectionQuotasTest.testListenerConnectionRateLimitWhenActualRateAboveLimit()` test to run for 20s as expected (earlier, there was a difference between what )\r\n4. Add new tests for scenario 1 and scenario 2 in `MetricsTest.java`\r\n5. Modified existing tests for throttling / quota management to remove the assumptions of calculation based on prior empty windows\r\n## Testing\r\nAll unit test pass using `./gradlew unitTest`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-12T13:25:00Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T15:02:46Z","closed_at":"2022-04-13T15:02:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ee44692be29126f80a02c172468f5419cbbaf36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12034/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12034/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12034/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c77262bbef2a9201d6981de9be42fba24e3e8446","head":{"label":"divijvaidya:KAFKA-12319","ref":"KAFKA-12319","sha":"c77262bbef2a9201d6981de9be42fba24e3e8446","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":472367950,"node_id":"R_kgDOHCfDTg","name":"kafka","full_name":"divijvaidya/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya/kafka","description":"Mirror

assignor logs is really confusing in large part because they are\r\nspread across different layers of abstraction (the ConsumerCoordinator \r\nand the ConsumerPartitionAssignor, which in Streams consists of several\r\nlayers of its own). Each layer in the abstraction reports useful information\r\nthat only it has access to, but because they are split over multiple lines, with\r\nmultiple members in the cluster, and (often) multiple rebalances taking place\r\nin rapid succession, it's often hard to understand which logs are part of\r\nwhich rebalance.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to improve the situation by adding a common prefix to\r\nall assignment logs that includes the current generation number. Then,\r\ndebuggers can pull out all logs for a particular rebalance with a simple\r\n`grep \"generationId=5\"`. In order to add this useful context without violating\r\nencapsulation, the PR simply adds a generic \"dynamic log context\" that\r\nassignors can optionally participate in (by mixing in `ContextualLogging`).\r\n\r\nI chose to keep these changes restricted to private APIs for the moment.\r\nIf this approach proves useful, we can propose a KIP at a later date to\r\nmake the APIs public.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

on https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11983\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this PR is to address several outstanding issues with incremental rebalancing that lead to stable-but-unbalanced clusters. However, other small bug fixes are also applied, and some liberty is taken with refactoring to improve readability and flexibility in the code base.\r\n\r\n~This should also address [KAFKA-12495](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12495), and includes an adapted [test case](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10367/files#diff-244a837479b827768c3daaabee8c7ad2064731377f1ad26a11bd890214252b7fR211-R358) from https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10367, which addresses that issue but with a different approach.~\r\n\r\nHigh-level changes:\r\n- Refine the logic for load-balancing revocations:\r\n- - Perform load-balancing revocations any time the cluster appears imbalanced and there are still connectors and tasks that can be revoked from workers, instead of only when the number of workers in the cluster changes\r\n- - Remove the \"rough estimation\" logic and replace it with a precise calculation of exactly how to allocate all currently-configured connectors and tasks as evenly as possible across a cluster\r\n- - Account for load-balancing revocations when assigning new and lost connectors and tasks across the cluster\r\n- Improve code quality:\r\n- - Extract the `ConnectorsAndTasks` class into its own file, enrich it and its builder class with developer-friendly methods, make its contents completely immutable, and use `Set` instead of generic `Collection` instances to store connectors and tasks\r\n- - Where possible, identify logic that is shared for connectors and tasks (`IncrementalCooperativeAssignor::assignConnectors` and `IncrementalCooperativeAssignor::assignTasks`, for example) and abstract it into a single reusable method\r\n- - Use the `final` keyword for base and derived sets in `IncrementalCooperativeAssignor::performTaskAssignment` (tracking mutations across a 100+ line method is difficult)\r\n- - Reword unnecessary and confusing comments (\"... is a derived set from the set difference of ...\" is not very informative)\r\n- - Reorganize the grouping of methods in `IncrementalCooperativeAssignor` to place static utility methods together at the bottom of the class\r\n- - Demote visibility of testing-only methods and fields from `protected` to package-private (`protected` implies that the field/method is intended for use by subclasses, which is not the case for any of these)\r\n- Testing:\r\n- - Add several new tests to cover a variety of new cases, many of which result in imbalanced allocation with the current rebalancing logic, but which are all correctly handled with the improvements in this PR\r\n- - Add a few testing utility methods to help \"hand wave\" test cases without having to specify fine-grained expectations like how many rounds of rebalance are required to reach stability after some changes have been applied to the cluster\r\n- - Add coverage to all tests that ensures that no connectors or tasks are both revoked and assigned from the same worker, and that the leader's view of the complete assignment of connectors and tasks across the cluster appears to be correct after each rebalance\r\n- Miscellaneous:\r\n- - Demote a ton of noisy `DEBUG`-level log messages to `TRACE`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-08T17:18:23Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T16:37:37Z","closed_at":"2022-08-29T12:25:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f430c015afc73cffa07345b1cefe5168b70f1023","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/eaca9de3dbbf01f784294272a5783a0238c09c9a","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-13764","ref":"kafka-13764","sha":"eaca9de3dbbf01f784294272a5783a0238c09c9a","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

KAFKA-13527 / KIP-784 we introduced a new top-level error code for\r\nthe DescribeLogDirs API for versions 3 and above. However, the change\r\nregressed the error handling for versions less than 3 since the response\r\nconverter fails to write the non-zero error code out (rightly) for\r\nversions lower than 3 and drops the response to the client which\r\neventually times out instead of receiving an empty log dirs response and\r\nprocessing that as a Cluster Auth failure.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the API conditionally propagates the error code out to\r\nthe client if the request API version is 3 and above. This keeps the\r\nsemantics of the error handling the same for all versions and restores\r\nthe behavior for older versions.\r\n\r\nSee current behavior in the broker log:\r\n```bash\r\nERROR]

PR refactors the leader API access in the follower fetch path. \r\n\r\nAdded a `LeaderEndPoint` interface which serves all access to the leader. \r\n\r\nAdded a `LocalLeaderEndPoint` and a `RemoteLeaderEndPoint` which implements the `LeaderEndPoint` interface to handle fetches from leader in local & remote storage respectively.\r\n\r\nModified `ReplicaAlterLogDirsThread` and `ReplicaFetcherThread` to accept a `LeaderEndPoint`, which is subsequently used to handle fetches.\r\n\r\nModified corresponding tests to account for the `LeaderEndPoint` refactor.\r\n\r\nCurrently in the process of adding test cases which directly test the fetch functions in `LocalLeaderEndPoint` and `RemoteLeaderEndPoint`.","created_at":"2022-04-06T22:09:20Z","updated_at":"2022-06-03T16:12:07Z","closed_at":"2022-06-03T16:12:07Z","merged_at":"2022-06-03T16:12:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"3467036e017adc3ac0919bbc0c067b1bb1b621f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4a889182a595ae3c7d6b845bdc4ae4372014bdc4","head":{"label":"rittikaadhikari:leader-endpoint","ref":"leader-endpoint","sha":"4a889182a595ae3c7d6b845bdc4ae4372014bdc4","user":{"login":"rittikaadhikari","id":13933251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTMzMjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13933251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari","html_url":"https://github.com/rittikaadhikari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467268295,"node_id":"R_kgDOG9nyxw","name":"kafka","full_name":"rittikaadhikari/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rittikaadhikari","id":13933251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTMzMjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13933251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari","html_url":"https://github.com/rittikaadhikari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rittikaadhikari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rittikaadhikari/kafka","description":"Mirror

unmuted without waiting for message being received on the socket, because the channel might have not been muted yet).","created_at":"2022-04-05T00:32:39Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T14:35:26Z","closed_at":"2022-04-06T14:35:26Z","merged_at":"2022-04-06T14:35:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"206ad4d2b530b1c0c776629256352cd044e68197","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11996/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11996/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11996/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/8b3f2dc5849b1acd9c15b4a0659c0abac19ed7ce","head":{"label":"anatasiavela:fix-flaky-testIdleConnection","ref":"fix-flaky-testIdleConnection","sha":"8b3f2dc5849b1acd9c15b4a0659c0abac19ed7ce","user":{"login":"anatasiavela","id":22284231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22284231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela","html_url":"https://github.com/anatasiavela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":193760435,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTM3NjA0MzU=","name":"kafka","full_name":"anatasiavela/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anatasiavela","id":22284231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22284231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela","html_url":"https://github.com/anatasiavela","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anatasiavela/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anatasiavela/kafka","description":"Mirror

a regression introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11452. Following [KIP-480](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-480%3A+Sticky+Partitioner), the `Partitioner` will receive a callback when a batch has been completed so that it can choose another partition. Because of this, we have to wait until the batch has been successfully appended to the accumulator before adding the partition in `TransactionManager.maybeAddPartition`. This is still safe because the `Sender` cannot dequeue a batch from the accumulator until it has been added to the transaction successfully.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

Summary of changes\r\n\r\n- Skip the calls to `AbstractConfig::logUnused` made by [KafkaConsumer](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/62ea4c46a9be7388baeaef1c505d3e5798a9066f/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.java#L815), [KafkaProducer](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/62ea4c46a9be7388baeaef1c505d3e5798a9066f/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.java#L432), and [KafkaAdminClient](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/62ea4c46a9be7388baeaef1c505d3e5798a9066f/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/KafkaAdminClient.java#L595) instances when the original config map is an instance of a [RecordingMap](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/62ea4c46a9be7388baeaef1c505d3e5798a9066f/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/config/AbstractConfig.java#L608-L612)\r\n- Modify `ConsumerConfig::appendDeserializerToConfig` and `ProducerConfig::appendSerializerToConfig` to preserve `RecordingMap` instances passed in to their constructors (or more precisely, create clones of those instances that retain the \"recording\" behavior of the original) so that all properties used by those consumers/producers are marked as used with the original `RecordingMap`\r\n- Use `WorkerConfig::originals` as the baseline when constructing configs to pass to Kafka clients that are used by the worker to manage its internal Kafka topics, so that all properties in the worker config that are used by those Kafka clients are marked as used in the `WorkerConfig`\r\n- Ignore all properties in the worker config that are transparently passed through to configurations for other components that:\r\n- - Perform their own logging for unused properties (such as producers and consumers used by connector instances, whose properties can be specified in a worker config with the `producer.` and `consumer.` prefixes, respectively)\r\n- - Are used transparently by the worker without accessing via either `AbstractConfig::get` (or one of its strongly-typed variants) or by invoking `Map::get` on the result of `AbstractConfig::originals` (or one of its prefixed variants) (such as internal topic settings)\r\n- - Are not constructed during worker startup, but instead brought up later (such as the default key, value, and header converters, which are instantiated on a case-by-case basis when bringing up connectors)\r\n- Log warnings for all unused (and non-ignored) properties in the `WorkerConfig` after worker startup has taken place\r\n- Disable all warnings for unused properties when constructing admin clients used by connectors as those include the top-level worker config, which is guaranteed to contain properties like `key.converter` that are not used by the admin client\r\n- Permit all warnings for unused properties when constructing producers and consumers used by connectors as those do not include the top-level worker config and unused properties should not be expected in these cases\r\n- Automatically ignore all automatically-injected metrics context properties that are added by the Connect framework when configuring Kafka clients since these are always provided (when Connect brings up Kafka clients) but are not always used\r\n\r\nI also fixed a bug introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8455 that causes a spurious warning to be logged when the worker config doesn't include a value for the `plugin.path` property.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI've verified this locally with a variety of cases including typos in the worker config (`gorup.id` instead of `group.id`), typos in connector client properties included in the worker config (`producer.clinet.id` instead of `producer.client.id`), correctly-skipped connector client properties included in the worker config (`consumer.max.poll.records`), connector client interceptor properties included in the worker config (`producer.interceptor.classes`, `some.interceptor.property.that.is.used`, `some.interceptor.property.that.is.not.used`), use of the DLQ topic in a sink connector, and use of automatic topic creation in a source connector. If this approach looks reasonable, I can automate these tests, probably by capturing logging output during an integration test run and asserting that warnings were issued only for the expected set of properties.\r\n\r\n### Edge cases\r\n\r\nNote that the `RecordingMap` class is subtly broken at the moment in that it doesn't take into account calls to `Map::forEach`, `Map::entrySet`, `Map::keySet`, `Map::values`, `Map::getOrDefault`, `Map::compute`, `Map::computeIfPresent`, etc. This comes into play with cases like when custom settings are specified for internal topics (see [TopicAdmin.NewTopicBuilder::config](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/62ea4c46a9be7388baeaef1c505d3e5798a9066f/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/util/TopicAdmin.java#L224-L240)). We may not want to invest too heavily into this approach for controlling warning messages if we want to develop a truly flexible solution that can be easily used by both internal and external

on the changes from https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11974, which exclusively touched on the `IncrementalCooperativeAssignorTest` test suite.\r\n\r\nThe goals here include:\r\n\r\n1. Create an overloaded variant of the `IncrementalCooperativeAssignor::performTaskAssignment` method that is more testing friendly by:\r\n    1. Returning the pre-serialization allocation and revocation of connectors and tasks across the cluster in a newly-introduced `ClusterAssignment` class, which eliminates the current pattern of creating a mock `IncrementalCooperativeAssignor` class, spying on one of its private methods, and capturing the argument passed to that spied-upon method\r\n    2. Accepting new parameters for the current snapshot of the config topic, the last-completed generation ID, and the current generation ID, which eliminates the need to create and manage a mocked `WorkerCoordinator` instance during testing\r\n    3. Not requiring parameters for the leader, config topic offset, or protocol version as these do not affect the logic for allocating connectors and tasks across a cluster\r\n    4. Only requires a `Map<String, ConnectorsAndTasks>` for the set of currently-running connectors and tasks across the cluster, instead of a `Map<String, ExtendedWorkerState>`, which contains unnecessary information like the leader, leader URL, protocol version, and config topic offset\r\n2. Simplify the parameter list for the `IncrementalCooperativeAssignor::handleLostAssignments` method, which in turn simplifies the logic for testing this class\r\n3. Capture repeated Java 8 streams logic in simple, reusable, easily-verifiable utility methods added to the `ConnectUtils` class\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-01T19:00:44Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T00:07:52Z","closed_at":"2022-05-09T13:43:47Z","merged_at":"2022-05-09T13:43:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"1278e385c02a44861e9d00b32c0f476d4b149be5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4a07def13852cab6f6b13a7eda1292eb65fe8b3d","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-13763-2","ref":"kafka-13763-2","sha":"4a07def13852cab6f6b13a7eda1292eb65fe8b3d","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

is strictly a testing refactor. No functional changes are made; this can be easily verified by confirming that the only affected file is the `IncrementalCooperativeAssignorTest.java` test suite.\r\n\r\nThese changes were initially discussed during review of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10367, which partially focused on improving readability in the unit tests for incremental rebalancing in Connect.\r\n\r\nThe goals here include:\r\n1. Simplify the logic that has to be manually specified on a per-test-case basis for simulating a rebalance (accomplished by extracting common logic into reusable utility methods such as `performRebalance` and `addNewEmptyWorkers`)\r\n2. Reduce the cognitive burden for following testing logic by removing unnecessary fields (like `expectedMemberConfigs` and `assignments`) and assertions (like the redundant checks for leader and leader URL)\r\n3. Add powerful, granular, and reusable utility methods that can provide stronger guarantees about the state of a cluster across successive rebalances without forcing people to track this state in their heads (accomplished by replacing the existing `assertAssignments` method with `assertWorkers`, `assertEmptyAssignment`, `assertConnectorAllocations`, and `assertTaskAllocations`, and by adding the new `assertBalancedAllocation` and `assertCompleteAllocation` methods)\r\n4. Refactor common logic for testing utilities to be more concise and reduce the number of Java 8 streams statements that have to be understood in order to read through a test case\r\n5. Fix a bug in the assertion logic for checking for duplicates currently present [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/b2cb6caa1e9267c720c00fa367a277ee8509baea/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/IncrementalCooperativeAssignorTest.java#L1447-L1451) and [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/b2cb6caa1e9267c720c00fa367a277ee8509baea/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/IncrementalCooperativeAssignorTest.java#L1456-L1460) ([`List::removeAll`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html#removeAll-java.util.Collection-) removes _all_ occurrences of any element contained in the collection passed to the method)\r\n6. Remove an incorrect assertion in the `assertNoReassignments` (now renamed to `assertNoRedundantAssignments`) method that there should be no duplicated connectors or tasks in the assignments reported by each worker to the leader during rebalance (this is unnecessary and even contradicts logic used for testing in cases like [this](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/b2cb6caa1e9267c720c00fa367a277ee8509baea/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/runtime/distributed/IncrementalCooperativeAssignorTest.java#L1112-L1125) where we intentionally simulate a worker with a duplicated set of connectors and/or tasks rejoining a cluster; the only reason this bug wasn't surfaced sooner is because the bug mentioned in the prior point covers it)\r\n\r\nOnce merged, this should allow for cleaner, faster test writing when adding new cases for incremental rebalancing, such as with https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10367.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-30T21:54:42Z","updated_at":"2022-04-05T19:45:52Z","closed_at":"2022-04-05T19:42:09Z","merged_at":"2022-04-05T19:42:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"88e5f133b5a572ba2ee786d10e74360fd62a104c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11974/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11974/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11974/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d68d57f528896a77e476bf6d0f42d8f5012fdcbb","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-13763","ref":"kafka-13763","sha":"d68d57f528896a77e476bf6d0f42d8f5012fdcbb","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

It is not clear wether the prefixing is the root cause of the issue or not. To be on the safe side, I think that we should remove the prefixing. It does not bring much anyway as we are still able to distinguish a custom reason from the default one on the broker side.\r\n\r\nThis patch removes prefixing the user provided reasons. So if a the user provides a reason, the reason is used directly. If the reason is empty or null, the default reason is used.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

major server components like the new quorum controller\r\nbeing moved outside of the `core` module, it is useful to\r\nhave shared dependencies moved into `server-common`. An example\r\nof this is Yammer metrics which server components still rely\r\nheavily upon. All server components should have access to the\r\ndefault registry used by the broker so that new metrics can\r\nbe registered and metric naming conventions should be\r\nstandardized. This is particularly important in KRaft where\r\nwe are attempting to recreate identically named metrics\r\nin the controller context.\r\n\r\nThis patch takes a step in this direction. It moves\r\n`KafkaYammerMetrics` into `server-common` and it implements\r\nstandard metric naming utilities there. It does not yet replace\r\nthe similarly named utilities in `KafkaMetricsGroup` because\r\nof its reliance on the implicit tag ordering of scala `Map` types.\r\nIn a follow-up patch, we can replace these implicit metrics\r\nwith explicitly ordered maps and ensure that tests cover them.\r\nOnce this is done, we can replace the utilities in\r\n`KafkaMetricsGroup` with their analogues in `KafakYammerMetrics`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

the StandardAuthorizer relies on the metadata log to store its ACLs, we need to be sure that\r\nwe have the latest metadata before allowing the authorizer to be used. However, if the authorizer\r\nis not usable for controllers in the cluster, the latest metadata cannot be fetched, because\r\ninter-node communication cannot occur. In the initial commit which introduced StandardAuthorizer,\r\nwe punted on the loading issue by allowing the authorizer to be used immediately. This commit fixes\r\nthat by implementing early.start.listeners as specified in KIP-801. This will allow in superusers\r\nimmediately, but throw the new AuthorizerNotReadyException if non-superusers try to use the\r\nauthorizer before StandardAuthorizer#completeInitialLoad is called.\r\n\r\nFor the broker, we call StandardAuthorizer#completeInitialLoad immediately after metadata catch-up\r\nis complete, right before unfencing. For the controller, we call\r\nStandardAuthorizer#completeInitialLoad when the node has caught up to the high water mark of the\r\ncluster metadata partition.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the SocketServer so that it creates the configured acceptors and processors in\r\nits constructor, rather than requiring a call to SocketServer#startup A new function,\r\nSocketServer#enableRequestProcessing, then starts the threads and begins listening on the\r\nconfigured ports. enableRequestProcessing uses an async model: we will start the acceptor and\r\nprocessors associated with an endpoint as soon as that endpoint's authorizer future is completed.\r\n\r\nAlso fix a bug where the controller and listener were sharing an Authorizer when in co-located\r\nmode, which was not intended.","created_at":"2022-03-29T20:52:55Z","updated_at":"2022-05-12T21:48:36Z","closed_at":"2022-05-12T21:48:33Z","merged_at":"2022-05-12T21:48:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa59be4e770627cd34cef85986b58ad7f606928d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11969/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11969/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11969/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/2a36bd1e630eb05af711f23b8fc48bbd2edf2c20","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-13649","ref":"KAFKA-13649","sha":"2a36bd1e630eb05af711f23b8fc48bbd2edf2c20","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

6.27.3 does not run on arm64 M1 Macs which would prevent people on this platform to run Kafka Streams. Thus, this PR upgrades RocksDB to 6.29.4.1 which contains the following fix to allow to run RocksDB on arm64 M1 Macs:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/7720\r\n\r\nThe source compatibility report between 6.27.3 and 6.29.4.1 (attached to the ticket) reports a couple of incompatibilities. However, the incompatibilities do not seem to affect Kafka Streams' backwards compatibility.\r\n- The changes to class `RocksDB` only apply when inheriting from RocksDB. RocksDB is not exposed to users in Streams.\r\n- The changes to class `WriteBatch` and class `WriteBatchInterface` also only apply with inheritance. Both classes are not exposed to users in Streams.\r\n-The change to enum `SanityLevel` seem also not to apply to Streams since `SanityLevel` is only used in `ConfigOptions` which is only used to load options from files and properties objects. Loading options from files or properties is not exposed to users in Streams.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

the topology-level cache size config only controls whether we disable the caching layer entirely for that topology, setting it to anything other than `0` has no effect. The actual cache memory is still just split evenly between the threads, and shared by all topologies.\r\n\r\nIt's possible we'll want to change this in the future, but for now we should make sure to log a warning so that users who do try to set this override to some nonzero value are made aware that it doesn't work like this.\r\n\r\nAlso includes [some minor

detailed description of your change,\r\nFix bug of resizing fetch threads. Partitions are not correctly re-partitioned when the fetcher thread pool is resized.\r\n\r\nThere is a method `addFetcherForPartitions` which add partitions to `fetcherThreadMap` within the iteration of `fetcherThreadMap` for all fetchers, which could lead to skipping some fetchers and these fetchers remain their topic partition assignment. Plus, there is no unit test for this case so that this bug remains from 1.1.0 to the latest version.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is tend to make this bug fixed with unit test for resizing and code refectory included. The idea is just to collect all topic partition from fetch threads and add them distributed to new threads when the number of fetchers changes.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nThe unit test is to check every partition with `getFetchId` for new fetcher thread and also check `failedPartitions` with new fetcher thread number.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-26T10:17:14Z","updated_at":"2022-03-31T12:54:38Z","closed_at":"2022-03-31T12:46:00Z","merged_at":"2022-03-31T12:46:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"430f9c99012d1585aa544d4dadf449963296c1fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f78d533320f7a0c73216722c60672baf25c7012e","head":{"label":"yufeiyan1220:yufeiyan_fix","ref":"yufeiyan_fix","sha":"f78d533320f7a0c73216722c60672baf25c7012e","user":{"login":"yufeiyan1220","id":28671976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjcxOTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28671976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220","html_url":"https://github.com/yufeiyan1220","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":474083456,"node_id":"R_kgDOHEHwgA","name":"kafka","full_name":"yufeiyan1220/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yufeiyan1220","id":28671976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjcxOTc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28671976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220","html_url":"https://github.com/yufeiyan1220","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufeiyan1220/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yufeiyan1220/kafka","description":"Mirror

`retryEndOffsets(…)` method in `TopicAdmin` recently added (KAFKA-12879, #11797) to allow the `KafkaBasedLog.start()` method to retry any failures reading the last offsets for a topic. However, this introduce a regression when talking to older brokers (0.10.x or earlier).\r\n\r\nThe `KafkaBasedLog` already had logic that expected an `UnsupportedVersionException` thrown by the admin client when a Kafka API is not available on an older broker, but the new retry logic in `TopicAdmin` did not account for this and wrapped the exception, thereby breaking the `KafkaBasedLog` logic and preventing startup.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to propagate this `UnsupportedVersionException` from the `TopicAdmin.retryEndOffsets(…)` method. Added a new unit test that first replicated the problem before the fix, and verified the fix corrects the problem.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design
