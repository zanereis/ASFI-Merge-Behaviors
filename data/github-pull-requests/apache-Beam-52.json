<code>transformers</code>  and we have decided to create an <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/awesome-transformers.md\">awesome-transformers</a> page to do just that.</p>\n<p>We accept PRs to add projects to the list!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top 100  by <a href=\"https://github.com/LysandreJik\"><code>@​LysandreJik</code></a> in <a

Among bug fixes, here are the important new features that were added:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local agent capabilities, to load a generative model directly from <code>transformers</code> instead of relying on APIs.</li>\n<li>Prompts are now hosted on the Hub, which means that anyone can fork the prompts and update them with theirs, to let other community contributors re-use them</li>\n<li>We add an <code>AzureOpenAiAgent</code> class to support Azure OpenAI agents.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Add local agent  by <a href=\"https://github.com/sgugger\"><code>@​sgugger</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/23438\">#23438</a></li>\n<li>Enable prompts on the Hub  by <a href=\"https://github.com/sgugger\"><code>@​sgugger</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/23662\">#23662</a></li>\n<li>Add AzureOpenAiAgent  by <a href=\"https://github.com/sgugger\"><code>@​sgugger</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/24058\">#24058</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Safetensors</h2>\n<p>The <code>safetensors</code> library is a safe serialization framework for machine learning tensors.

A series of models called ‘SwiftFormer’ is built based on this, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and mobile inference speed. Even their small variant achieves 78.5% top-1 ImageNet1K accuracy with only 0.8 ms latency on iPhone 14, which is more accurate and 2× faster compared to MobileViT-v2.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add swiftformer  by <a href=\"https://github.com/shehanmunasinghe\"><code>@​shehanmunasinghe</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/22686\">#22686</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Autoformer</h3>\n<p>This model augments the Transformer as a deep decomposition architecture, which can progressively decompose the trend and seasonal components during the forecasting process.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[Time-Series] Autoformer model  by <a href=\"https://github.com/elisim\"><code>@​elisim</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/21891\">#21891</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

<code>transformers</code>  and we have decided to create an <a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/awesome-transformers.md\">awesome-transformers</a> page to do just that.</p>\n<p>We accept PRs to add projects to the list!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Top 100  by <a href=\"https://github.com/LysandreJik\"><code>@​LysandreJik</code></a> in <a

Among bug fixes, here are the important new features that were added:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local agent capabilities, to load a generative model directly from <code>transformers</code> instead of relying on APIs.</li>\n<li>Prompts are now hosted on the Hub, which means that anyone can fork the prompts and update them with theirs, to let other community contributors re-use them</li>\n<li>We add an <code>AzureOpenAiAgent</code> class to support Azure OpenAI agents.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Add local agent  by <a href=\"https://github.com/sgugger\"><code>@​sgugger</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/23438\">#23438</a></li>\n<li>Enable prompts on the Hub  by <a href=\"https://github.com/sgugger\"><code>@​sgugger</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/23662\">#23662</a></li>\n<li>Add AzureOpenAiAgent  by <a href=\"https://github.com/sgugger\"><code>@​sgugger</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/24058\">#24058</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Safetensors</h2>\n<p>The <code>safetensors</code> library is a safe serialization framework for machine learning tensors.

A series of models called ‘SwiftFormer’ is built based on this, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and mobile inference speed.

Among bug fixes, here are the important new features that were added:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local agent capabilities, to load a generative model directly from <code>transformers</code> instead of relying on APIs.</li>\n<li>Prompts are now hosted on the Hub, which means that anyone can fork the prompts and update them with theirs, to let other community contributors re-use them</li>\n<li>We add an <code>AzureOpenAiAgent</code> class to support Azure OpenAI agents.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Add local agent  by <a href=\"https://github.com/sgugger\"><code>@​sgugger</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/23438\">#23438</a></li>\n<li>Enable prompts on the Hub  by <a href=\"https://github.com/sgugger\"><code>@​sgugger</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/23662\">#23662</a></li>\n<li>Add AzureOpenAiAgent  by <a href=\"https://github.com/sgugger\"><code>@​sgugger</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/24058\">#24058</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Safetensors</h2>\n<p>The <code>safetensors</code> library is a safe serialization framework for machine learning tensors. It has been audited and will become the default serialization framework for several organizations (Hugging Face, EleutherAI, Stability AI).</p>\n<p>It has now become a core dependency of <code>transformers</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making <code>safetensors</code> a core dependency.  by <a href=\"https://github.com/Narsil\"><code>@​Narsil</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/23254\">#23254</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New models</h2>\n<h3>Swiftformer</h3>\n<p>The SwiftFormer paper introduces a novel efficient additive attention mechanism that effectively replaces the quadratic matrix multiplication operations in the self-attention computation with linear element-wise multiplications. A series of models called ‘SwiftFormer’ is built based on this, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and mobile inference speed. Even their small variant achieves 78.5% top-1 ImageNet1K accuracy with only 0.8 ms latency on iPhone 14, which is more accurate and 2× faster compared to MobileViT-v2.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add swiftformer  by <a href=\"https://github.com/shehanmunasinghe\"><code>@​shehanmunasinghe</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/22686\">#22686</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Autoformer</h3>\n<p>This model augments the Transformer as a deep decomposition architecture, which can progressively decompose the trend and seasonal components during the forecasting process.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[Time-Series] Autoformer model  by <a href=\"https://github.com/elisim\"><code>@​elisim</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/21891\">#21891</a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

change was required to allow for testing, and allow multiple consumers to get the MessageStream at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn particular:\r\n* The current state is always available to be returned on new streams.\r\n* Messages are buffered to a fixed amount, so new subscribers can get the tail of previous messages. This will be useful for observing jobs from the UI.\r\n* Buffer reduces the likelyhood of lock contention, but it's unlikely that prism will have a \"too many subscribers\" problem for the messages stream.\r\n\r\nTODO in another PR: Timestamp state and message events.

throughput estimates are improved by storing the estimates per partition (in StreamProgress) rather than per dofn instance. This required some refactoring of ThroughputEstimator/SizeEstimator. It now estimates throughput (per second) of the last ReadChangeStream request and stores it in StreamProgress (current SDF position).\r\n\r\nThe motivation for changing the measurement is that the DoFn instance level ThroughputEstimator can lead to inaccuracy because partitions move around between DoFn instances constantly. This has caused us to see cases where we estimate a small backlog and prevent scaling down when there is no backlog. \r\n\r\nWe account for heartbeats in order to prevent dataflow from scaling down too much when there are little to no mutations, so that it can't hit a point where it can no longer keep up with heartbeats.  \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

patch to avoid cross compiling the periodic test binary. It's the only test that defaults to prism right now.\r\n\r\nIt's up for consideration about making this the default mode for invocations of prism locally, which will continue to use loopback by default when it's the default runner. This makes the unit tests less sensitive to environments where the Go tooling may not be available, such as in a Bazel env.\r\n\r\nAlso: \r\n* Tiny lint change from += 1 to ++.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#26299\r\n\r\nI don't know why you didn't set `declaration: true` or why you included the test dirs.  I tried flattening the structure of the dist dir, but I got all sorts of import errors.  Someone with more knowledge of the intricacies of NPM packages may be able to do better than I did.\r\n\r\nI added more exports because there was no other way to access things inside `io` or the `windowings.js` exports.  Not sure why everything isn't exported, because I can't see another way to use the code.\r\n\r\nHappy to revise if someone suggests a better fix, but this fixes all of my import issues.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Notes</h2>\n<p>This release fixes various bugs, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parsing certain <code>decimal128</code> values from Extended JSON can take a long time.</li>\n<li>Some database errors can cause the driver to unexpectedly mark the database topology as unknown.</li>\n<li><code>RewrapManyDataKey</code> should return an error if it's called with <code>masterKey</code> and without <code>provider</code>.</li>\n<li>&quot;connectionId&quot; returned in heartbeats may be <code>int64</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also adds the <code>Cursor.SetBatchSize</code> API, which allows changing the document batch size requested for subsequent cursor iterations.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For a full list of tickets included in this release, please see the links below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a

prebuilt Python container size by disabling pip cache when installing dependencies.\r\n\r\nWe're only installing dependencies once, so by not caching dependencies we don't have to keep an extra copy of the dependencies, thus reducing the amount of disk space needed and the container image size. This also helps to avoid running out of disk when installing large dependencies like `tensorflow` or `torch`.\r\n\r\nR: @tvalentyn\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Write Transform already has necessary logic for capturing errors and tagging them. The tags used however are not consistent with the rest of the transforms and the error metrics are not being tracked as well. Adding the correct error tag will enable the error records to be picked up by the dlq. The error counters have also been added for correct metric tracking.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR enables remote build caching for the Apache Beam project.\r\n\r\nThe ASF Infra team has created a remote build cache node for the Apache Beam project at [beam-cache.apache.org/cache](https://beam-cache.apache.org/cache/). By using this cache node, Apache Beam build times can be decreased by sharing build results across CI build nodes with other nodes and with local builds. The cache node is for use by the Beam project. No other ASF projects will write to this cache node.\r\n\r\nThe cache node is anonymously readable, but is only writeable with a set of credentials for use only in CI builds. These credentials have been pre-configured on the Beam controller for Jenkins at [ci-beam.apache.org](https://ci-beam.apache.org/).\r\n\r\nfixes #26914\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[github.com/tetratelabs/wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.2.0</h2>\n<p>wazero 1.2.0 includes 33 days of valiant effort towards performance, interop and debug goals, shared not only in wazero, but WebAssembly in general. We appreciate folks waiting a couple more days than usual and expect you'll enjoy what you see below.</p>\n<p>While we haven't set a formal post 1.0 release cadence, you can expect another patch or minor within a month. Meanwhile, this is our most performant and best tested release yet. As always, <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/stargazers\">star</a> all the projects that interest you, and say thanks when you can.</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>Performance is something we aim to always improve, release to release. This includes looking at memory usage as well as latency. While there were multiple people involved in efficiency work, <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/lburgazzoli\"><code>@​lburgazzoli</code></a> deserve special call outs for leading efforts, and <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> deserves a big pat on the back for contributing reviews, cleanups and advice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> made many changes internal to our compiler, as well linux-only specializations such as using huge pages for the memory mapped regions under wasm functions. These were all profile and benchmark guided changes and proposed in top rigor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/lburgazzoli\"><code>@​lburgazzoli</code></a> tracked down best practice in TinyGo, consolidating advice from various experts, such as the primary developer of TinyGo <a href=\"https://github.com/aykevl\"><code>@​aykevl</code></a>. He worked with <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> to make sure our <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/tree/main/examples/allocation/tinygo\">allocation example</a> is not just a code snippet, but an exemplar of good practice, without risk of memory leaks and performance validated with benchmarks.</p>\n<p>The combination of backend work (e.g. runtime improvements) and frontend work (e.g. changes to our TinyGo example) combined in a notable holistic gain across the board. This was true teamwork and a job well done!</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ benchstat v1.1.0.txt v1.2.0.txt \ngoos: darwin\ngoarch: arm64\npkg: github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/internal/integration_test/vs/compiler\n                          │  v1.1.0.txt  │             v1.2.0.txt             │\n                          │    sec/op    │   sec/op     vs base               │\nAllocation/Compile-12       3.365m ±  1%   3.174m ± 1%   -5.66% (p=0.002 n=6)\nAllocation/Instantiate-12   149.1µ ± 26%   120.4µ ± 7%  -19.23% (p=0.002 n=6)\nAllocation/Call-12          1.404µ ±  2%   1.297µ ± 2%   -7.66% (p=0.002 n=6)\ngeomean                     88.97µ         79.13µ       -11.05%\n<pre><code>                      │  v1.1.0.txt  │              v1.2.0.txt               │\n                      │     B/op     │     B/op      vs base                 │\n</code></pre>\n<p>Allocation/Compile-12       2.404Mi ± 0%   1.292Mi ± 0%  -46.24% (p=0.002 n=6)\nAllocation/Instantiate-12   319.4Ki ± 0%   230.5Ki ± 0%  -27.84% (p=0.002 n=6)\nAllocation/Call-12            48.00 ± 0%     48.00 ± 0%        ~ (p=1.000 n=6) ¹\ngeomean                     33.28Ki        24.27Ki       -27.07%\n¹ all samples are equal</p>\n<pre><code>                      │ v1.1.0.txt  │              v1.2.0.txt              │\n                      │  allocs/op  │  allocs/op   vs base                 │\n</code></pre>\n<p>Allocation/Compile-12       1.830k ± 0%   1.595k ± 0%  -12.84% (p=0.002 n=6)\nAllocation/Instantiate-12    803.0 ± 0%    508.0 ± 0%  -36.74% (p=0.002 n=6)\nAllocation/Call-12           5.000 ± 0%    5.000 ± 0%        ~ (p=1.000 n=6) ¹\ngeomean                      194.4         159.4       -18.00%\n¹ all samples are equal\n</code></pre></p>\n<h2>Interop</h2>\n<p>Compatibility is a moving target as both specifications change as well understanding of specifications. For example, the WebAssembly Core Specification 2.0 remains in <a href=\"https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/intro/introduction.html\">a draft state</a>, and expectations of the VM change as it changes. Also the d'facto WASI version preview1 (a.k.a. wasip1) had no tests, nor <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/snapshot-01/phases/snapshot/docs.md\">detailed documentation</a> for the first several years of its existence. This left interop as more a quorum of implementation practice vs a spec. While new initiatives such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-testsuite\">wasi-testsuite</a> and <a href=\"https://wasmer.io/posts/announcing-wasix\">wasix</a> aim to stabilize this, WASI compatibility remains a source of work from wazero maintainers and compiler developers. We really appreciate the efforts spent here to keep as many users unaware of these glitches as possible.</p>\n<p>On the WebAssembly Core (VM) side, we appreciate <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> updating our code and spec suite to pass latest changes there. Also, we appreciate an attempt by <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> with support by <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads\">Threads proposal</a>, despite us ending up parking the idea until the proposal finishes.</p>\n<p>On the WASI side, we appreciate a lot of work driven by the team working on Go. Specifically, the upcoming <code>GOOS=wasip1</code> planned for <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/golang/go/issues/58141\">1.21</a> helped reveal a number of grey areas that required work to support in Go without breaking other languages. Championing these came from various team members including <a href=\"https://github.com/Pryz\"><code>@​Pryz</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/achille-roussel\"><code>@​achille-roussel</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/evacchi\"><code>@​evacchi</code></a> on various file rights and non-blocking related glitches, some fixing other language runtimes such as python.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

PR closes #27007 with a solution that processes Eventarc Pub/Sub messages posted from Dataflow Job state changes, reads related Dataflow Jobs' data using the Dataflow API and writes to BigQuery. Additionally, this PR contains all the terraform necessary for developers to provision all the required resources to run the pipeline in a Google Cloud project. An optional terraform module is included that allows developers to build a Dataflow Flex template of this pipeline.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#27003 \r\n\r\nA couple of comments:\r\n\r\n1) I don't think we need any images, but if we were to include one, it could be an image of the skill badge itself? Thoughts?\r\n2) Currently, the last paragraph reads that if there are issues, they can reach out to the Beam community, in addition to qwiklabs support. Should we include that in this feedback workflow?\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
