API versions aren't compatible - it's impossible to operate with classic load balancer (ELB) using v2 API and vice versa. So separate driver for ALB needs to be implemented.\r\n\r\nThis change implements Provider.ALB driver with basic read functionality provided by the following methods:\r\n- list_balancers;\r\n- get_balancer;\r\n- balancer_list_members;\r\n- ex_balancer_list_listeners.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\ndone, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n- [ ] [Code

Add additional supported storage types to create_volume\n### Description\n\nEC2 supports additional storage types geared toward throughput and cold storage. We have a need for the cold storage volume type but libcloud currently doesn't support it. It seemed a good idea to just put up a pull request for this instead of asking for the change since it's so small.\n\nWe didn't feel there was a need to create a test for this change, nor additional documentation examples. If this is not the case we can add them.\n### Status\n- done, ready for review\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n- [*] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\n- [ ] Documentation\n- [ ]

Prevent GCE auth to hide S3 auth\n### Description\n\nWe currently authenticate to Google Cloud Storage using Amazon S3 compatibility auth. Our code runs in Kubernetes on Google Container Engine. We tried to upgrade libcloud recently but 3849f65 from @crunk1 prevented us to authenticate. (Interestingly, it's also the commit that made us want to upgrade, since we eventually want to use service accounts.)\n\nThe issue happened for two reasons:\n- `GoogleAuthType._is_gce()` always returns True when the code is run on the Google Container Engine, regardless of the authentication provided (which makes the issue impossible to reproduce in a local Docker environment)\n- `GoogleAuthType._is_gcs_s3()` is always checked _after_ `_is_gce()`, so it could not be used on Google Container Engine\n\nThis pull request simply changes the order to give S3 higher priority. Note that Installed Applications auth has lower priority still, because it's the default auth when everything else fails. That's OK because I guess it's not possible on GCE. Still, I think the documentation should recommend to always specify the auth type, because explicit is better than implicit and it helps to avoid unclear errors.\n### done, ready for review\n###

Minor fix for Docker Driver response parsing\n### Description\n\nAs reported in the corresponding bug, the docker daemon will respond in an install_image call with all the messages produced during the procedure parsed as json docs. In that case the response headers also contain the value 'transfer-encoding':'chunked'. That kind of response can now be parsed properly by the DockerResponse parse_body method. Also, another small change is that previously the id of the new image was marked in the json document as id, but now it's marked as sha256, so the regex used to discover the id has been updated. Finally the test data have been updated both for linux and for mac for install_image tests where this behavior has been observed and the version of the test fixtures has been bumped up to 124 to show the change more clearly.\n### Status\n\nDone and ready for review.\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\n- [x]

Create Simplified Chinese Version of README.rst\n### Description\n\nHello, I translated the README.rst to Simplified Chinese using Google Translate and my own understanding in Simplified Chinese language. I hope this can help people who are not fluent in English but are fluent in Chinese to be able to understand the project easier and faster. There are some words that I didn't convert to Chinese either because they are special names, or specific links which does not have a translated version ( for example at line 68: LICENSE_ an NOTICE_ ). The file name is README-zh.rst, but I don't mind if its changed, its just for easier initial identification.\n### Status\n\ndone, ready for review\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n- [ ]

Return Object Changes and State Handling Fixup\n### Description\n\n> This should hopefully be my last PR for a long-time regarding the Rancher driver. At least until `v2` comes out ;)\n\nThis PR changes the way the `start_container`, `stop_container`, and `destroy_container` functions work. They still return a container object as expected, but that object is now made from the actual response we receive from Rancher (which is not just a empty 204, but the full json for the container question), not another `get_container` call.\n\nThis is most certainly the better way to handle this:\n\n```\nIn [1]: con = driver.get_container('1i24')\n\nIn [2]: con\nOut[2]: <Container: id=1i24, name=newconbr0,state=running, provider=Rancher ...>\n\nIn [3]: stopcon = driver.stop_container(con)\n\nIn [4]: stopcon\nOut[4]: <Container: id=1i24, name=newconbr0,state=terminated, provider=Rancher ...>\n\nIn [5]: stopcon.extra['state']\nOut[5]: 'stopping'\n\nIn [6]: startcon = driver.start_container(stopcon)\n\nIn [7]: startcon\nOut[7]: <Container: id=1i24, name=newconbr0,state=terminated, provider=Rancher ...>\n\nIn [8]: startcon.extra['state']\nOut[8]: 'starting'\n\nIn [9]: destroycon = driver.destroy_container(startcon)\n\nIn [10]: destroycon\nOut[10]: <Container: id=1i24, name=newconbr0,state=terminated, provider=Rancher ...>\n\nIn [11]: destroycon.extra['state']\nOut[11]: 'stopping'\n\n```\n#### State Handling Fix\n\nWhile the above output shows that our return objects are much better, it shows another issue. For some reason, `state=terminated` when we're in the process of a transition (starting, stopping, etc..). Looking deeper, I found my `elif` for terminated state doesn't work as expected. I've fixed this by using `any`. I've also modified the tests to properly check for this.\n\nNow it works as expected:\n\n```\nIn [4]: con = driver.get_container('1i31')                                          \n\nIn [5]: con                                                                         \nOut[5]: <Container: id=1i31, name=newcontainer,state=stopped, provider=Rancher ...> \n\nIn [6]: startcon = driver.start_container(con)                                      \n\nIn [7]: startcon                                                                    \nOut[7]: <Container: id=1i31, name=newcontainer,state=pending, provider=Rancher ...> \n\nIn [8]: startcon.extra['state']        \nOut[8]: 'starting'                     \n\nIn [9]: startcon.extra['transitioning']\nOut[9]: 'yes'

Better Error Handling and `start_container`\n### Description\n\nThis PR extends the Rancher Driver to add `start_container` support. It follows the base class so providing a container object is necessary (and you get one back as expected).\n\nAdditionally, I ran into an a scenario where fields which caused errors would return something like:\n\n```\nIn [12]: driver.ex_deploy_service(name='empty_test', image=image, environment_id=\"\", service_description=\"testing\", environment={\"ohnoes\":\"maybe\"})\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBaseHTTPError                             Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-12-e9850d5a4dbf> in <module>()\n----> 1 driver.ex_deploy_service(name='empty_test', image=image, environment_id=\"\", service_description=\"testing\", environment={\"ohnoes\":\"maybe\"})\n/home/mloria/arrovenv/libcloud/libcloud/container/drivers/rancher.py in ex_deploy_service(self, name, image, environment_id, start, assign_service_ip_address, service_description, external_i\nd, metadata, retain_ip, scale, scale_policy, secondary_launch_configs, selector_container, selector_link, vip, **launch_conf)\n    394         data = json.dumps(dict((k, v) for (k, v) in service_payload.items()\n    395                                if v is not None))\n--> 396         result = self.connection.request('%s/services' % self.baseuri,\n    397                                          data=data, method='POST').object\n    398\n/home/mloria/arrovenv/libcloud/libcloud/common/base.py in request(self, action, params, data, headers, method, raw)\n    860\n    861         try:\n--> 862             response = responseCls(**kwargs)\n    863         finally:\n    864             # Always reset the context after the request has completed\n/home/mloria/arrovenv/libcloud/libcloud/common/base.py in __init__(self, response, connection)\n    177             raise exception_from_message(code=self.status,\n    178                                          message=self.parse_error(),\n--> 179                                          headers=self.headers)\n    180\n    181         self.object = self.parse_body()\n\nBaseHTTPError: None - None\n```\n\nSo I edited `parse_error` to check for this and print something a bit nicer:\n\n```\nBaseHTTPError: name is NotUnique: None - None\n```\n###

Rancher Container Driver\n### Description\n\nThis is a new Container Driver for [Rancher](http://rancher.com/), the fantastic container orchestration platform that supports the likes of Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Mesos frameworks. It provides a fantastic abstraction layer for working with these frameworks on any infrastructure you'd like! Plus it's [open-source](https://github.com/rancher/rancher)!\n\nUtilizing the v1 API and extensively working with the [docs](http://docs.rancher.com/rancher/v1.2/en/api/), I've managed to get an initial version of a fairly reliable ContainerDriver for Libcloud. It follows the normal Container conventions as closely as possible and provides extensive docstrings for excellent interaction, even without a massive understanding of Rancher itself.\n\nThe three main top-level Rancher items are implemented:\n- Containers\n- Services (`ex_*`)\n- Environments (`ex_*`)\n\nAlthough not every possible action is available, the necessities like creation and deletion plus things like activation, get, search, and list are included.\n\n> As you review this, please ask questions if you aren't sure about how something is implemented!\n#### Background\n\nWith [Arroyo Networks'](https://arroyonetworks.com/) upcoming NaaS platform, [Inflow](https://arroyonetworks.com/#services), I've been hard at work establishing our Infrastructure assets. Rancher has seemed a clear choice to help us maintain a nimble platform not tied to any specific back-end Infrastructure provider. Hence, much of our Python code needs a way to interact with our clusters, so writing a Libcloud plugin was pretty much a no-brainer.\n#### Example\n\n```\nfrom libcloud.container.providers import get_driver\nfrom libcloud.container.types import Provider\n\ndriver = get_driver(Provider.RANCHER)\nconnection = driver(key=\"ACCESS_KEY_HERE\", secret=\"SECRET_KEY_HERE\", host=\"172.30.0.100\", port=8080)\n\nimage = ContainerImage(\"hastebin\", \"hastebin\", \"rlister/hastebin\", \"latest\", driver=None) \nnewcontainer = connection.deploy_container(\"myawesomepastebin\", image, environment={\"STORAGE_TYPE\": \"file\"})\n```\n### Status\n- done, ready for review\n\nI have tested this works appropriately with Rancher Server v1.1.3 (API v1).\n\nOf course, I want persons looking at this to pay attention to the whole PR. However, there are a few key areas I want some focus on:\n- Unnecessary sections (do I really need `parse_body`?)\n- Inefficient handling (is there a better way to do Image parsing or TLS/SSL support?)\n- Error Handling looks/works sanely.\n- Convention adherence (I'm a newer programmer; I may not know well established `*ism's`)\n\nI encourage reviewers to pull my branch and play with this ;)\n#### Notes\n- Does not support user based API credentials, only Environment API credentials (one env, no cluster support)\n- Does not support images other than docker formatted images. `docker:` prefix is forced!\n  - Images follow a standardized format. See `deploy_container` docstring!\n- Does not support filters for searching/listing. (no `image` or `all` support in `list_containers`)\n- The `launchConfig` for `ex_deploy_service` is actually all defined at the top level. This is because I easily pass it through `_build_payload` (**kwargs) since the options are nearly identical to those of a normal container. No reason to duplicate work. This also makes it easier since most people only generally want to deploy a service with only one container anyways. This may need to change later when we want >1 container for a service.\n- Passing your own cert/key for SSL/TLS is not presently supported.\n- For SSL/TLS (https) support with newer versions of OpenSSL, the following is necessary (in your own code): \n  \n  ```\n  import ssl\n  import libcloud.security\n  libcloud.security.SSL_VERSION = ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2\n  ```\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks) - _`flake8` completed successfully ;)_\n- [x] Documentation - _See Docstrings and docs/_\n- [x] [Tests](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/testing.html) - _Perfected ;)_\n- [x] [ICLA](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#contributing-bigger-changes) (required for bigger changes) - _Corporate Agreement Submitted!_\n### Thanks\n\nI have worked closely with [Anthony Shaw](https://github.com/tonybaloney), a core contributor to Libcloud (especially the Container stuffs) as well as [Vincent Fiduccia](https://github.com/vincent99), software architect at Rancher Labs. The have been invaluable in helping me establish a solid driver for

Support filtering in EC2 list_volumes\n### Description\n\nThere currently is not a way to filter volumes in the EC2 driver list_volumes.  This is a useful feature for identifying volumes with certain attributes - e.g. orphaned volumes.  The filtering param is already implicitly used in list_volumes to specify an attached instance-id, if node arg is provided.  This change allows additional explicit filters to be provided.\n\nThe particular issue I have run into motivating this change is - if I create a volume using create_volume and immediately attach it to a node using attach_volume I occasionally run into errors where the volume was created but is not yet ready for attachment.  I can use list_volumes to fetch everything and filter on my end, but I'd rather filter server side as I am with list_images and other similar functions.\n\nI also added a docstring. \n###

Make create_volume more robust on newer OpenStacks\n### Description\n\nOn newer OpenStacks, things will fail if you do not provide `location` or if you do not provide `ex_volume_type`. The driver will pass the default `None` values to `self.driver.request`, which serializes them to `null`, which is an invalid value for `/os-volumes/` on newer incarnations of OpenStack.\n\nThis PR makes it so the OpenStack driver does not include these fields if they are None, so they are not refused by OpenStack's validation.\n### Status\n- done, ready for review\n### Checklist (tick

get_list_of_xx calls by allowing for filter by network id\n\nDescription\n\nWhile developing utils using libcloud, I found that there were several routines in the LoadBalancer driver that just did not seem right. Specifically, these were the \"get a list of XXX\"-type routines. I felt (and others agreed) that it was \"less than ideal\" that these routines all defaulted to \"return EVERYTHING from your company across ALL networks\". Initially, I assumed that it would filter by network (since I had already told the LB Driver what my network Id was. However, in testing my util, I found that it return LoadBalancers (in my case) from networks that I had never heard of.\n\nTherefore, I created this PR. The interface changes are BACKWARDS compatible.\nFor example:\ndef list_balancers(self) ==> def list_balancers(self, network_id=None)\n\nStatus\n\nThis code has been tested to show that:\n\nby default, the original all-encompassing lists are returned.\nusing the new parameter, a list that only applies to the given network id is returned.\nI do have several more tests that I want to run. I won't be able to get to those until 8/31/16 though.\n\nChecklist (tick everything that applies)\n\nI will get to these (and update the PR as needed) on the 31st.\nI just wanted to get you this code as soon as possible.\n\n Code linting (required, can be done after the PR checks)\n\n Documentation\n Tests\n ICLA (required for bigger changes)\nNOTE: We took this \"concept\" and applied to all the places that WE needed. This may apply to the compute and backup drivers as well.\n","created_at":"2016-08-26T02:39:52Z","updated_at":"2016-09-05T11:56:57Z","closed_at":"2016-09-05T11:56:57Z","merged_at":"2016-09-05T11:56:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"3cf068409eaa448556a46b556e3f165f82b86116","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/855/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/855/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/855/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/3cf068409eaa448556a46b556e3f165f82b86116","head":{"label":"NexusIS:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"3cf068409eaa448556a46b556e3f165f82b86116","user":{"login":"NexusIS","id":5184004,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjUxODQwMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5184004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS","html_url":"https://github.com/NexusIS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65396133,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTM5NjEzMw==","name":"libcloud","full_name":"NexusIS/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NexusIS","id":5184004,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjUxODQwMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5184004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS","html_url":"https://github.com/NexusIS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NexusIS/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NexusIS/libcloud","description":"Apache

Fix corruption bug in Google auth token caching\n### Description\n\nThe `GoogleOAuth2Credential. _write_token_to_file()` method writes a copy of the latest OAuth token to disk. Prior to this fix, the token was being written to disk without truncating the file first, which is fine in the case where the new token has the same number of characters (or more) as the old one. However, in some situations Google OAuth returns a shorter token string, which was causing the library to crash when loading the corrupted token.\n### Status\n\nFixed, needs tests.\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\n- [ ] Documentation\n- [
