for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to port minimal code to generate TPC-DS data from [databricks/spark-sql-perf](https://github.com/databricks/spark-sql-perf). The classes in a new class file `tpcdsDatagen.scala` are basically copied from the `databricks/spark-sql-perf` codebase.\r\nNote that I've modified them a bit to follow the Spark code style and removed unnecessary parts from them.\r\n\r\nThe code authors of these classes are:\r\n@juliuszsompolski \r\n@npoggi\r\n@wangyum\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe frequently use TPCDS data now for benchmarks/tests, but the classes for the TPCDS schemas of datagen and benchmarks/tests are managed separately, e.g., \r\n - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/TPCDSBase.scala\r\n - https://github.com/databricks/spark-sql-perf/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/databricks/spark/sql/perf/tpcds/TPCDSTables.scala\r\n\r\n I think this causes some inconveniences, e.g., we need to update both files in the separate repositories if we update the TPCDS schema #32037. So, it would be useful for the Spark codebase to generate them by referring to the same schema definition.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\ndev only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually checked and GA

First level is from `RowBasedHashMapGenerator`, which is computation faster compared to the second level from `UnsafeFixedWidthAggregationMap`. The introducing of two level hash map can help improve CPU performance of query as the first level hash map normally fits in hardware cache and has cheaper hash function for key lookup.\r\n\r\nFor final hash aggregation, we can also support two level of hash map, to improve query performance further.\r\nThe original two level of hash map code works for final aggregation mostly out of box. The major change here is to support testing fall back of final aggregation (see change related to `bitMaxCapacity` and `checkFallbackForGeneratedHashMap`).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nAn aggregation query:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n    |SELECT key, avg(value)\r\n    |FROM agg1\r\n    |GROUP BY key\r\n  \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated code for final aggregation is [here](https://gist.github.com/c21/20c10cc8e2c7e561aafbe9b8da055242).\r\n\r\nAn aggregation query with testing fallback:\r\n```\r\nwithSQLConf(\"spark.sql.TungstenAggregate.testFallbackStartsAt\" -> \"2, 3\") {\r\n  spark.sql(\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n      |SELECT key, avg(value)\r\n      |FROM agg1\r\n      |GROUP BY key\r\n    \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe generated code for final aggregation is [here](https://gist.github.com/c21/dabf176cbc18a5e2138bc0a29e81c878). Note the no more counter condition for first level fast map.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add a test to check that Thrift server is able to collect year-month intervals and transfer them via thrift protocol.\r\n2. Improve similar test for day-time intervals. After the changes, the test doesn't depend on the result of date subtractions. In the future, the type of date subtract can be changed. So, current PR should make the test tolerant to the changes. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ ./build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *SparkThriftServerProtocolVersionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-19T18:30:42Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T05:52:53Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T05:52:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ea6dd3c3867182764677f14f52ca384dcc72a66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e01c6500de299ce25d45b09ad5f994da72b8267c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:year-month-interval-thrift-protocol","ref":"year-month-interval-thrift-protocol","sha":"e01c6500de299ce25d45b09ad5f994da72b8267c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR partially backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31758 to 3.1, to fix a backward compatibility issue caused by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28490\r\n\r\nThe query below has different output schemas in 3.0 and 3.1\r\n```\r\nsql(\"select struct(1, 2) as s\").groupBy(col(\"s.col1\")).agg(first(\"s\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 3.0 the output column name is `col1`, in 3.1  it's `s.col1`. This breaks existing queries.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28490 , we changed the logic of resolving aggregate expressions. What happened is that the input nested column `s.col1` will become `UnresolvedAlias(s.col1, None)`. In `ResolveReference`, the logic used to directly resolve `s.col` to `s.col1 AS col1` but after #28490 we enter the code path with `trimAlias = true and !isTopLevel`, so the alias is removed and resulting in `s.col1`, which will then be resolved in `ResolveAliases` as `s.col1 AS s.col1`\r\n\r\n#31758 happens to fix this issue because we no longer wrap `UnresolvedAttribute` with `UnresolvedAlias` in `RelationalGroupedDataset`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix an unexpected query output schema change\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes as explained above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

fixes issue #35124. Note that it is quite unlikely that this issue would be mitigated or fixed in the Python standard library itself code due to the history of \"subprocess.list2cmdline\" (see https://bugs.python.org/issue8972 which was created in 2010).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds support for a number of special characters (such as \"&\") appearing in Spark configuration values (common in cloud resource URIs).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf one of the relevant characters appears in a configuration value, the Windows submit scripts do not work correctly, interpreting the character literally. For example, an ampersand marks the beginning of a new command (leading Windows to actually start multiple processes which would typically fail with a rather strange and unexpected error message).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested manually, providing a configuration value with a \"&\" character in it.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-19T14:40:17Z","updated_at":"2021-10-05T00:09:34Z","closed_at":"2021-10-05T00:09:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3e89fdb1efab7f28d7bff1c7e506defa3575fce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32237/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32237/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32237/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ed9037503b759f415a5f7632fc40d5ac5745592","head":{"label":"malthe:spark-35124","ref":"spark-35124","sha":"5ed9037503b759f415a5f7632fc40d5ac5745592","user":{"login":"malthe","id":26405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe","html_url":"https://github.com/malthe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":359468837,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTk0Njg4Mzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"malthe/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"malthe","id":26405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe","html_url":"https://github.com/malthe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malthe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/malthe/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTo prevent potential NullPointerExceptions, this PR changes the `LiveStage` constructor to take `info` as a constructor parameter and adds a nullcheck in  `AppStatusListener.activeStages`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `AppStatusListener.getOrCreateStage` would create a LiveStage object with the `info` field set to null and right after that set it to a specific StageInfo object. This can lead to a race condition when the `livestages` are read in between those calls. This could then lead to a null pointer exception in, for instance: `AppStatusListener.activeStages`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRegular CI/CD tests\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-19T10:08:22Z","updated_at":"2021-04-19T15:12:44Z","closed_at":"2021-04-19T15:09:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86aa4828abbeab85d4c55f3adec5b2792da4613e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb93507955a2d2c490c3a6ba2f611adc6e01c521","head":{"label":"sander-goos:SPARK-35136-livestage","ref":"SPARK-35136-livestage","sha":"eb93507955a2d2c490c3a6ba2f611adc6e01c521","user":{"login":"sander-goos","id":69472612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDcyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69472612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos","html_url":"https://github.com/sander-goos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321677363,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE2NzczNjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"sander-goos/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sander-goos","id":69472612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NDcyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69472612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos","html_url":"https://github.com/sander-goos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sander-goos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sander-goos/spark","description":"Apache

introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n- Check Jenkins log manually, there should be only \r\n\r\n`copying

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExtend the `Average` expression to support `DayTimeIntervalType` and `YearMonthIntervalType` added by #31614.\r\n\r\nNote: the expressions can throw the overflow exception independently from the SQL config `spark.sql.ansi.enabled`. In this way, the modified expressions always behave in the ANSI mode for the intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExtend `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.Average` to support `DayTimeIntervalType` and `YearMonthIntervalType`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nShould not since new types have not been released yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins test\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-19T06:49:57Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T10:10:41Z","closed_at":"2021-04-19T12:57:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a859ee795b856e0a66a5bfad9f622af895f0c6b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32229/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32229/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32229/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20cc8b16b467505e7c5cb6841daec8eeeb5a9105","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-34837","ref":"SPARK-34837","sha":"20cc8b16b467505e7c5cb6841daec8eeeb5a9105","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\ncolumns like 'On Heap Memory Useage', 'On Heap Memory Useage', 'Disk Usage' in table `Data Distribution` of storage page should be sorted as numerical-order instead of lexicographical-order.\r\n\r\nThe problem is very similar to #32190, but the cause of the problem is completely different, so a new pr was submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbuf fix,the sorting style should be consistent between different columns.\r\n\r\nWhen the storage page is initialized, it will infer the type of columns in the table to detect which sorting method(such as `sort_alpha`, `sort_numberic`, `sort_mmdd` etc.) to use. \r\n\r\n**Columns which contains a storage unit in the table will be inferred to be sorted use function `sort_alpha`, but the data (numerical value+unit)should be converted into the actual number of bytes and then sorted.**\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nOnly JS was modified, and the manual test result works well.\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n![data distribution table in storage tab sort

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI have a long-running spark service that continuously receives and runs spark programs submitted by the client. There is a program that can load the jdbc table, and one is passed in the query option\r\nVery complicated sql. Each execution of this SQL requires a lot of time and resources. When the client submits such a request, the client can interrupt work at any time. I found that after the job was interrupted, the query process in the database was still executing and had not been killed yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf the query process in the database cannot be killed after the job is cancelled, the spark task will be in a blocked state at this time, waiting for the stmt.executeQuery() method to complete.\r\nIf the client frequently executes such complex SQL and cannot cancel the execution, this will cause the database to be particularly stressful.\r\n\r\nInterrupt the listener thread by starting the job. When the job is cancelled, execute the `stmt.cancel()` method to kill the database query process, which is not only friendly to the database, but also releases the task.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running the affected test suite:\r\n`$ build/mvn test -DwildcardSuites=none

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo simplify the code base to handle these two commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, just internal refactoring.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThe existing tests (e.g., `CachedTableSuite`) cover the changes in this PR. For example, if I make `CacheTable`/`UncacheTable` extend `LeafCommand`, there are few failures in `CachedTableSuite`.","created_at":"2021-04-18T05:24:11Z","updated_at":"2021-04-19T08:11:55Z","closed_at":"2021-04-19T06:00:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"34486f91b44ac6eb5c58b60fd2aeef12a0684b46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32220/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32220/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32220/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0caf46ece1cf5169f50d8be7ac8513c2b7c8739","head":{"label":"imback82:cache_cmd_analysis_only","ref":"cache_cmd_analysis_only","sha":"c0caf46ece1cf5169f50d8be7ac8513c2b7c8739","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr enhances `EliminateOuterJoin` to eliminate outer joins if join condition is not defined. For example:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"set spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1\")\r\nspark.sql(\"create table t1 using parquet as select id as a, id as b from range(10)\")\r\nspark.sql(\"create table t2 using parquet as select id as a, id as b from range(20)\")\r\nspark.sql(\"select t1.a, t2.a from t1 full join t2\").explain(true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this pr:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- BroadcastNestedLoopJoin BuildLeft, FullOuter\r\n   :- BroadcastExchange IdentityBroadcastMode, [id=#43]\r\n   :  +- FileScan parquet default.t1[a#16L]\r\n   +- FileScan parquet default.t2[a#18L]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this pr:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nCartesianProduct\r\n:- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n:  +- FileScan parquet

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add additional checks for ANSI interval types `YearMonthIntervalType` and `DayTimeIntervalType` to `LiteralExpressionSuite`.\r\n\r\nAlso, I replaced some long literal values by `CalendarInterval` to check `CalendarIntervalType` that the tests were supposed to check. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve test coverage and have the same checks for ANSI types as for `CalendarIntervalType`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe precision of `java.time.Duration` is nanosecond, but when it is used as `DayTimeIntervalType` in Spark, it is microsecond.\r\nAt present, the `DayTimeIntervalType` data generated in the implementation of `RandomDataGenerator` is accurate to nanosecond, which will cause the `DayTimeIntervalType` to be converted to long, and then back to `DayTimeIntervalType` to lose the accuracy, which will cause the test to fail. For example: https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/137390/testReport/org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution/HashAggregationQueryWithControlledFallbackSuite/udaf_with_all_data_types/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove `RandomDataGenerator` so that the generated data fits the precision of DayTimeIntervalType in spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'. Just change the test class.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins

Shuffled hash join tends to have OOM issue because it allocates in-memory hashed relation (`UnsafeHashedRelation` or `LongHashedRelation`) for build side, and there's no recovery (e.g. fallback/spill) once the size of hashed relation grows and cannot fit in memory. On the other hand, shuffled hash join is more CPU and IO efficient than sort merge join when joining one large table and a small table (but small table is too large to be broadcasted), as SHJ does not sort the large table, but SMJ needs to do that. See historical discussion in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11788 for evidence.\r\n\r\nTo improve the reliability of shuffled hash join, a fallback mechanism can be introduced to avoid shuffled hash join OOM issue automatically. Similarly we already have a fallback to sort-based aggregation for hash aggregate. The idea is:\r\n\r\n* Build hashed relation as current, but stop adding rows to hashed relation if there's no enough memory. Do not throw exception, and do not fail the task/query.\r\n* Sort stream side and build side on join keys if necessary. Note here we need to read all build rows in hashed relation back and destruct the hashed relation on the fly to free memory.\r\n* Execute sort merge join on sorted stream & build side.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n(1).the fallback is automatic and happened per task, which means task 0 can incur the fallback e.g. if it has a big build side, but task 1,2 don't need to incur the fallback depending on the size of hashed relation.\r\n\r\n(2).there's no major code change for SHJ and SMJ. Major change is around `HashedRelation` to introduce some new methods, e.g. `HashedRelation.destructiveValues()` to return an Iterator of build side rows in hashed relation and destruct hashed relation on the fly.\r\n\r\n(3).Per this PR, a new config `spark.sql.join.enableShuffledHashJoinFallback` is introduced to enable/disable this feature (disable by default). This PR only supports fallback for non-code-gen execution path. Fallback for code-gen will be added in followup PRs, as it will depend on sort merge join code-gen work (SPARK-34705).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nShuffled hash join OOM is a huge pain point for users and developers. This is the major reason why people stay away from shuffled hash join. This can improve reliability for shuffled hash join quite a bit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nParse the year-month interval literals like `INTERVAL '1-1' YEAR TO MONTH` to values of `YearMonthIntervalType`, and day-time interval literals to `DayTimeIntervalType` values. Currently, Spark SQL supports:\r\n- DAY TO HOUR\r\n- DAY TO MINUTE\r\n- DAY TO SECOND\r\n- HOUR TO MINUTE\r\n- HOUR TO SECOND\r\n- MINUTE TO SECOND\r\n\r\nAll such interval literals are converted to `DayTimeIntervalType`, and `YEAR TO MONTH` to `YearMonthIntervalType` while loosing info about `from` and `to` units.\r\n\r\n**Note**: new behavior is under the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.interval.enabled` which is `false` by default. When the config is set to `true`, the interval literals are parsed to `CaledarIntervalType` values.\r\n\r\nCloses #32176\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo conform the ANSI SQL standard which assumes conversions of interval literals to year-month or day-time interval but not to mixed interval type like Catalyst's `CalendarIntervalType`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT INTERVAL '1 01:02:03.123' DAY TO SECOND;\r\n1 days 1 hours 2 minutes 3.123 seconds\r\nspark-sql> SELECT typeof(INTERVAL '1 01:02:03.123' DAY TO SECOND);\r\ninterval\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT INTERVAL '1 01:02:03.123' DAY TO SECOND;\r\n1 01:02:03.123000000\r\nspark-sql> SELECT typeof(INTERVAL '1 01:02:03.123' DAY TO SECOND);\r\nday-time interval\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ ./build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.ExpressionParserSuite\"\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z interval.sql\"\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z create_view.sql\"\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z date.sql\"\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z timestamp.sql\"\r\n```\r\n2. PostgresSQL tests are executed with `spark.sql.legacy.interval.enabled` is set to `true` to keep compatibility with PostgreSQL output:\r\n```sql\r\n> SELECT interval '999' second;\r\n0 years 0 mons 0 days 0 hours 16 mins 39.00 secs\r\n```","created_at":"2021-04-16T19:15:55Z","updated_at":"2021-04-19T16:58:08Z","closed_at":"2021-04-19T13:01:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5afee74b271288251c310e260a001ded855a7c97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32209/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32209/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32209/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/790815029a4072346ac38c57737b98a619080aa0","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:parse-ansi-interval-literals","ref":"parse-ansi-interval-literals","sha":"790815029a4072346ac38c57737b98a619080aa0","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a couple of things in TypeCoercion rules:\r\n- Only run the propagate types step if the children of a node have output attributes with changed dataTypes and/or nullability. This is implemented as custom tree transformation. The TypeCoercion rules now only implement a partial function.\r\n- Combine multiple type coercion rules into a single rule. Multiple rules are applied in single tree traversal.\r\n- Reduce calls to conf.get in DecimalPrecision. This now happens once per tree traversal, instead of once per matched expression.\r\n- Reduce the use of withNewChildren.\r\n\r\nThis brings down the number of CPU cycles spend in analysis by ~28% (benchmark: 10 iterations of all TPC-DS queries on SF10).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nClean up code in `HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol#commitJob` to avoid renames that will always fail (usually silently).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis renames in this block will always fail under `dynamicPartitionOverwrite == true`:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0494dc90af48ce7da0625485a4dc6917a244d580/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/io/HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol.scala#L191-L218\r\n\r\nWe have the following sequence of events:\r\n1. The first block deletes all parent directories of `filesToMove.values`\r\n2. The for-loop block attempts to rename all `filesToMove.keys` to `filesToMove.values`\r\n3. The third block does directory-level renames to place files into their final locations\r\n\r\nAll renames in the for-loop will always fail, since all parent directories of `filesToMove.values` were just deleted. Under a normal HDFS scenario, the contract of `fs.rename` is to return `false` under such a failure scenario, as opposed to throwing an exception. This allows for dynamic partition overwrite to work, albeit with a bunch of failed renames in the middle. Really, we should only run the for-loop deletions in the `dynamicPartitionOverwrite == false` case, and consolidate the two if-blocks for the `true` case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIn almost all cases, no. However if you happen to use a `FileSystem` implementation which throws an exception on this kind of `fs.rename` case, `dynamicPartitionOverwrite` will be unusable prior to this PR, and start working after this PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nDid not add/modify tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR extends `ADD FILE/JAR/ARCHIVE` commands to be able to take multiple path arguments like Hive.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make those commands more useful.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. In the current implementation, those commands can take a path which contains whitespaces without enclose it by neither `'` nor `\"` but after this change, users need to enclose such paths.\r\nI've note this incompatibility in the migration guide.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes move JSON data source options from Python, Scala and Java into a single page.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSo far, the documentation for JSON data source options is separated into different pages for each language API documents. However, this makes managing many options inconvenient, so it is efficient to manage all options in a single page and provide a link to that page in the API of each language.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the documents will be shown below after this change:\r\n\r\n- \"JSON Files\" page\r\n<img width=\"876\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-05-20 at 8 48 27 PM\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis issue fixes an issue that indentation of multiple output JSON records in a single split file are broken except for the first record in the split when `pretty` option is `true`.\r\n```\r\n// Run in the Spark Shell.\r\n// Set spark.sql.leafNodeDefaultParallelism to 1 for the current master.\r\n// Or set spark.default.parallelism for the previous releases.\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.leafNodeDefaultParallelism\", 1)\r\nval df = Seq(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\").toDF\r\ndf.write.option(\"pretty\", \"true\").json(\"/path/to/output\")\r\n\r\n# Run in a Shell\r\n$ cat /path/to/output/*.json\r\n{\r\n  \"value\" : \"a\"\r\n}\r\n {\r\n  \"value\" : \"b\"\r\n}\r\n {\r\n  \"value\" : \"c\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's not pretty even though `pretty` option is true.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nI think \"No\". Indentation style is changed but JSON format is not changed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test.","created_at":"2021-04-16T06:15:01Z","updated_at":"2021-04-16T11:45:08Z","closed_at":"2021-04-16T08:01:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"976719cd528f0908d817d2bc56512661f9956170","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a77d95b0288e92f353c5240ec4a6cb83c7f3c464","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-ugly-indentation","ref":"fix-ugly-indentation","sha":"a77d95b0288e92f353c5240ec4a6cb83c7f3c464","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, I proposed  a function to allow HiveMetastoreCatalog could read source files of non-partitioned hive table with subdirectories when new configuration \"spark.sql.nonPartitionedTable.subdirectory.read.enabled\" is set. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHive already have configurations to handle similar issues, but the built-in reader couldn't.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the new configuration \"spark.sql.nonPartitionedTable.subdirectory.read.enabled\" has been added and the default value is \"false.\"\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-16T05:54:39Z","updated_at":"2021-09-10T00:09:41Z","closed_at":"2021-09-10T00:09:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d1f08fb045afff8f684dc4bdee4f664e0dc49e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7cc9c959345ce28c3ae380a46388f049f9971ac7","head":{"label":"FatalLin:SPARK-28098","ref":"SPARK-28098","sha":"7cc9c959345ce28c3ae380a46388f049f9971ac7","user":{"login":"FatalLin","id":5687317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODczMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5687317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin","html_url":"https://github.com/FatalLin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":357410839,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTc0MTA4Mzk=","name":"spark-1","full_name":"FatalLin/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FatalLin","id":5687317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODczMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5687317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin","html_url":"https://github.com/FatalLin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FatalLin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FatalLin/spark-1","description":"Apache

This config has no effect\r\n// to Spark, just for reporting the builtin Hive version of Spark to existing applications that\r\n// already rely on this config.\r\nval FAKE_HIVE_VERSION = buildConf(\"spark.sql.hive.version\")\r\n  .doc(s\"deprecated, please use ${HIVE_METASTORE_VERSION.key} to get the Hive version in Spark.\")\r\n  .version(\"1.1.1\")\r\n  .fallbackConf(HIVE_METASTORE_VERSION)\r\n```\r\nIt is used for reporting the built-in Hive version but the current status is unsatisfactory, as it is could be changed in many ways e.g. --conf/SET syntax.\r\n\r\nIt is marked as deprecated but kept a long way until now. I guess it is hard for us to remove it and not even necessary.\r\n\r\nOn second thought, it's actually good for us to keep it to work with the `spark.sql.hive.metastore.version`. As when `spark.sql.hive.metastore.version` is changed, it could be used to report the compiled hive version statically, it's useful when an error occurs in this case. So this parameter should be fixed to compiled hive version.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`spark.sql.hive.version` is useful in certain cases and should be read-only\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`spark.sql.hive.version` now is read-only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a re-proposal of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23163. Currently spark always requires a [local sort](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/FileFormatWriter.scala#L188) before writing to output table with dynamic partition/bucket columns. The sort can be unnecessary if cardinality of partition/bucket values is small, and can be avoided by keeping multiple output writers concurrently.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a config `spark.sql.maxConcurrentOutputFileWriters` (which disables this feature by default), where user can tune the maximal number of concurrent writers. The config is needed here as we cannot keep arbitrary number of writers in task memory which can cause OOM (especially for Parquet/ORC vectorization writer).\r\n\r\nThe feature is to first use concurrent writers to write rows. If the number of writers exceeds the above config specified limit. Sort rest of rows and write rows one by one (See `DynamicPartitionDataConcurrentWriter.writeWithIterator()`).\r\n\r\nIn addition, interface `WriteTaskStatsTracker` and its implementation `BasicWriteTaskStatsTracker` are also changed because previously they are relying on the assumption that only one writer is active for writing dynamic partitions and bucketed table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid the sort before writing output for dynamic partitioned query and bucketed table.\r\nHelp improve CPU and IO performance for these queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in

`pyspark.pandas`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe should port the whole Koalas codes into PySpark and synchronize them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFixed some incompatible behavior with pandas 1.2.0 and added more to the `to_markdown` docstring.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHandle `YearMonthIntervalType` and `DayTimeIntervalType` in the `sql()` and `toString()` method of `Literal`, and format the ANSI interval in the ANSI style.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve readability and UX with Spark SQL. For example, a test output before the changes:\r\n```\r\n-- !query\r\nselect timestamp'2011-11-11 11:11:11' - interval '2' day\r\n-- !query schema\r\nstruct<TIMESTAMP '2011-11-11 11:11:11' - 172800000000:timestamp>\r\n-- !query output\r\n2011-11-09 11:11:11\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not since the new intervals haven't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ ./build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAQE has an optimization where it attempts to reuse compatible exchanges but it does not take into account whether the exchanges are columnar or not, resulting in incorrect reuse under some circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply changes the key used to lookup cached stages. It now uses the canonicalized form of the new query stage (potentially created by a plugin) rather than using the canonicalized form of the original exchange.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen using the [RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark](https://github.com/NVIDIA/spark-rapids) we sometimes see a new query stage correctly create a row-based exchange and then Spark replaces it with a cached columnar exchange, which is not compatible, and this causes queries to fail.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch has been tested with the query that highlighted this issue. I looked at writing unit tests for this but it would involve implementing a mock columnar exchange in the tests so would be quite a bit of work. If anyone has ideas on other ways to test this I am happy to hear them.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-15T19:18:15Z","updated_at":"2021-05-20T11:22:50Z","closed_at":"2021-05-19T12:46:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11788c0f28a599565a624c1ea2baeaec2db55028","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32195/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32195/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32195/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dbe2f9cb1d4de25721d85153c0ca7164f19034f0","head":{"label":"andygrove:SPARK-35093","ref":"SPARK-35093","sha":"dbe2f9cb1d4de25721d85153c0ca7164f19034f0","user":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205463461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU0NjM0NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"andygrove/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTL;DR: now it shows green yellow read status of tests instead of relying on a comment in a PR, **see https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/41 for an example**.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the GitHub status checks instead of a comment that link to the build (from forked repository) in PRs.\r\n\r\nThis is how it works:\r\n\r\n1. **forked repo**: \"Build and test\" workflow is triggered when you create a branch to create a PR which uses your resources in GitHub Actions. \r\n1. **main repo**: \"Notify test workflow\" (previously created a comment) now creates a in-progress status (yellow status) as a GitHub Actions check to your current PR.\r\n1.  **main repo**: \"Update build status workflow\" regularly (every 15 mins) checks open PRs, and updates the status of GitHub Actions checks at PRs according to the status of workflows in the forked repositories (status sync).\r\n\r\n**NOTE** that creating/updating statuses in the PRs is only allowed from the main repo. That's why the flow is as above.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe GitHub status shows a green although the tests are running, which is confusing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested at:\r\n- https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark/pull/41\r\n- HyukjinKwon#42\r\n-

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark, we have an extension in the MERGE syntax: INSERT/UPDATE *. This is not from ANSI standard or any other mainstream databases, so we need to define the behaviors by our own.\r\n\r\nThe behavior today is very weird: assume the source table has `n1` columns, target table has `n2` columns. We generate the assignments by taking the first `min(n1, n2)` columns from source & target tables and pairing them by ordinal.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a more reasonable behavior: take all the columns from target table as keys, and find the corresponding columns from source table by name as values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix the MEREG INSERT/UPDATE * to be more user-friendly and easy to do schema evolution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, but MERGE is only supported by very few data sources.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n columns like 'Shuffle Read Size / Records', 'Output Size/ Records' etc  in table ` Aggregated Metrics by Executor` of stage-detail page should be sorted as numerical-order instead of lexicographical-order.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbuf fix,the sorting style should be consistent between different columns.\r\n\r\nThe

that the sorting results of columns 9-12 are wrong:\r\n\r\n![simulate-result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52202080/115120775-c9fa1580-9fe1-11eb-8514-71f29db3a5eb.png)\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the real data corresponding to columns 9-12 (note that it is not the data displayed on the page) are **all strings similar to`94685/131`(bytes/records),while the real data corresponding to columns 13-18 are all numbers,** \r\nso the sorting corresponding to columns 13-18 loos well, but the results of columns 9-12 are incorrect because the strings are sorted according to lexicographical order. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nOnly JS was modified, and the manual test result works well.\r\n\r\n**before modified:**\r\n![looks-illegal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52202080/115120812-06c60c80-9fe2-11eb-9ada-fa520fe43c4e.png)\r\n\r\n**after

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR updated the `foundNonEqualCorrelatedPred` logic for correlated subqueries in `CheckAnalysis` to only allow correlated equality predicates that guarantee one-to-one mapping between inner and outer attributes, instead of all equality predicates. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix correctness bugs. Before this fix Spark can give wrong results for certain correlated subqueries that pass CheckAnalysis:\r\nExample 1:\r\n```sql\r\ncreate or replace view t1(c) as values ('a'), ('b')\r\ncreate or replace view t2(c) as values ('ab'), ('abc'), ('bc')\r\n\r\nselect c, (select count(*) from t2 where t1.c = substring(t2.c, 1, 1)) from t1\r\n```\r\nCorrect results: [(a, 2), (b, 1)]\r\nSpark results:\r\n```\r\n+---+-----------------+\r\n|c  |scalarsubquery(c)|\r\n+---+-----------------+\r\n|a  |1                |\r\n|a  |1                |\r\n|b  |1                |\r\n+---+-----------------+\r\n```\r\nExample 2:\r\n```sql\r\ncreate or replace view t1(a, b) as values (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3);\r\ncreate or replace view t2(c) as values (6);\r\n\r\nselect c, (select count(*) from t1 where a + b = c) from t2;\r\n```\r\nCorrect results: [(6, 4)]\r\nSpark results:\r\n```\r\n+---+-----------------+\r\n|c  |scalarsubquery(c)|\r\n+---+-----------------+\r\n|6  |1                |\r\n|6  |1                |\r\n|6  |1                |\r\n|6  |1                |\r\n+---+-----------------+\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Users will not be able to run queries that contain unsupported correlated equality predicates.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit

needed?\r\nthey are not needed, but will help the community understand how to build systems to test multiple versions of spark, as well as propose changes that i can integrate in to the \"production\" riselab repo.  since we're sunsetting jenkins by EOY 2021, this will potentially be useful for migrating the build system.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n###

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nConsolidate PySpark testing utils by removing `python/pyspark/pandas/testing`, and then creating a file `pandasutils` under `python/pyspark/testing` for test utilities used in `pyspark/pandas`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`python/pyspark/pandas/testing` hold test utilites for pandas-on-spark, and `python/pyspark/testing` contain test utilities for pyspark. Consolidating them makes code cleaner and easier to maintain.\r\n\r\nUpdated import statements are as shown below:\r\n- from pyspark.testing.sqlutils import SQLTestUtils\r\n- from pyspark.testing.pandasutils import PandasOnSparkTestCase, TestUtils \r\n(PandasOnSparkTestCase is the original ReusedSQLTestCase in `python/pyspark/pandas/testing/utils.py`)\r\n\r\nMinor improvements include:\r\n- Usage of missing library's requirement_message\r\n- `except ImportError` rather than `except`\r\n- import pyspark.pandas alias as `ps` rather than `pp`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests under python/pyspark/pandas/tests.\r\n\r\nKeyword:SPARK-34849","created_at":"2021-04-14T20:37:23Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T17:45:46Z","closed_at":"2021-04-22T20:07:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82e73b532c97b34f318048b24ed9f8875d0acf28","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32177/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32177/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32177/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/95bdbcf2b368f0a1f252f963a5c4fb534d387ec0","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:port.merge_utils","ref":"port.merge_utils","sha":"95bdbcf2b368f0a1f252f963a5c4fb534d387ec0","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOnly trigger the notify test workflow in upstream\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe should only trigger the notify test workflow in upstream apache/spark job, otherwise we will trigger the same workflow twice in fork repos.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nSee local test in https://github.com/Yikun/spark/pull/13,\r\nThe notify test is skiped in fork repo.\r\nhttps://github.com/Yikun/spark/pull/13/checks?check_run_id=2345776215\r\n\r\nNote that current [notify_test_workflow with pull_request_target event](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/f32114d17e1c022817a16c83f33138a1b8faa7c6/.github/workflows/notify_test_workflow.yml#L3) doesn't use something like `action/checkout` to checkout code. So this skip will only effect when this patch is merged, I just use change the `pull_request_target` the `pull request` to do local test.","created_at":"2021-04-14T18:10:01Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T03:46:29Z","closed_at":"2021-04-15T03:42:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7485533f7621cf540e10ddab52ac0f56fa545178","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6fde92ddf121f0ca98eb9fa523e1a7afbd5201a7","head":{"label":"Yikun:SPARK-35046-f1","ref":"SPARK-35046-f1","sha":"6fde92ddf121f0ca98eb9fa523e1a7afbd5201a7","user":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335541670,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU1NDE2NzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"Yikun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport `date +/- day-time interval`. In the PR, I propose to update the binary arithmetic rules, and cast an input date to a timestamp at the session time zone, and then add a day-time interval to it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To conform the ANSI SQL standard which requires to support such operation over dates and intervals:\r\n<img width=\"811\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-03-12 at 11 36 14\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1580697/111081674-865d4900-8515-11eb-86c8-3538ecaf4804.png\">\r\n2. To fix the regression comparing to the recent Spark release 3.1 with default settings.\r\n\r\nBefore the changes:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date'now' + (timestamp'now' -

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to rename Koalas to pandas-on-Spark in main codes\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo have the correct name in PySpark. NOTE that the official name in the main documentation will be pandas APIs on Spark to be extra clear. pandas-on-Spark is not the official term.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's master-only change. It changes the docstring and class names.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./python/run-tests --python-executable=python3 --modules

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR refactors three parts of the comments in `HiveClientImpl.withHiveState`\r\n\r\nOne is about the following comment.\r\n```\r\n// The classloader in clientLoader could be changed after addJar, always use the latest                                                           \r\n// classloader.\r\n```\r\nThe comment was added in SPARK-10810 (#8909) because `IsolatedClientLoader.classLoader` was declared as `var`.\r\nBut the field is now `val` and cannot be changed after instanciation.\r\nSo, the comment can confuse developers.\r\n\r\nOne is about the following code and comment.\r\n```\r\n// classloader. We explicitly set the context class loader since \"conf.setClassLoader\" does\r\n// not do that, and the Hive client libraries may need to load classes defined by the client's\r\n// class loader.\r\nThread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(clientLoader.classLoader)\r\n```\r\nIt's not trivial why this part is necessary and it's difficult when we can remove this code in the future.\r\nSo, I revised the comment by adding the reference of the related JIRA.\r\n\r\nAnd the last one is about the following code and comment.\r\n```\r\n// Replace conf in the thread local Hive with current conf\r\nHive.get(conf)\r\n```\r\nIt's also not trivial why this part is necessary.\r\nI revised the comment by adding the reference of the related discussion.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make code more readable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nIt's just a comment refactoring so I add no new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes move Parquet data source options from Python, Scala and Java into a single page.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSo far, the documentation for Parquet data source options is separated into different pages for each language API documents. However, this makes managing many options inconvenient, so it is efficient to manage all options in a single page and provide a link to that page in the API of each language.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the documents will be shown below after this change:\r\n\r\n- \"Parquet Files\" page\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-05-21 at 1 35 08

`pyspark.pandas`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe should port the whole Koalas codes into PySpark and synchronize them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to enable the JSON datasources to write non-ascii characters as codepoints.\r\nTo enable/disable this feature, I introduce a new option `writeNonAsciiCharacterAsCodePoint` for JSON datasources.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nJSON specification allows codepoints as literal but Spark SQL's JSON datasources don't support the way to do it.\r\nIt's great if we can write non-ascii characters as codepoints, which is a platform neutral representation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users can write non-ascii characters as codepoints with JSON datasources.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test.","created_at":"2021-04-13T07:44:55Z","updated_at":"2021-04-30T06:24:22Z","closed_at":"2021-04-29T16:50:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b27251f3b6c3d39d7356a3ad6f8aa5a02304aba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/93efbb3c72edd58804d70d683de76d767eb8dc85","head":{"label":"sarutak:json-unicode-write","ref":"json-unicode-write","sha":"93efbb3c72edd58804d70d683de76d767eb8dc85","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror
