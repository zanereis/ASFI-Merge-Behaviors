What problem does this PR solve?\r\n1、应用不同接口的处理逻辑不尽相同，qps和延迟也不尽相同，很多时候我们想为某些接口预留一定的能力，比如heartbeat接口或者其它控制层面的接口。\r\n2、应用有些接口延迟比较高，如果这些接口的请求比较多（超过worker数量）会导致其它请求的延迟增加，对于延迟敏感接口产生影响。因此需要将这些延迟高的接口独立出来。\r\n3、不同接口处理逻辑上的不同也需要独立线程池的划分，比如，io请求要提交到绑定了磁盘设备驱动的线程上，在这个特定的线程上磁盘设备驱动完成io的提交和收割工作。\r\n4、一些阻塞worker线程的调用会让这些worker线程不可用，影响bthread的调度，比如worker1排队很多请求，前边一个请求要阻塞worker，虽然后续请求会被调度到其它worker，但是这个过程使任务在不同worker间调度，还是有很多消耗的。\r\n5、不同应用逻辑差异很大，很难在应用层根据服务或者方法将任务很细致的划分到不同线程池，代码实现复杂度很高，在框架层面实现能更加简单。\r\nIssue

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n以下引起E112错误之后无法自行恢复的几种场景：\r\n1. 网络抖动后遗症，一直出现E112无法自行恢复\r\n配置dns访问外网，dns只解析出一个ip，然后网络抖动过程中出现少量连接失败，返回错误码为ECONNREFUSED或ENETUNREACH或EHOSTUNREACH或EINVAL，满足does_error_affect_main_socket从而触发main socket SetFailed。\r\n但是正常来说，SetFailed之后过100ms就开始健康检查，每3秒重试一次。所以按理当网格抖动恢复后，最长3秒后，就不应该再出现E112了。但是实际上仍有E112持续出现，如果重启进程，则不会再出现。\r\n2. 以single server模式初始化channel，第一次连接失败之后socket被SetFailed，后面重试就都选不出服务了。\r\n3. 出现一个ETIMEOUT之后，就一直出现EHOSTDOWN，没有恢复。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n目前针对各种原因导致的E112错误，提供一套通用的解决方案：\r\n一、防止实例封禁导致的E112：在对实例进行封禁的时候，加上是否为唯一可用实例判断\r\n1. 如果是SingleServer模式（即直接以ip+port方式初始化Channel，不通过NamingService+LB），则只有唯一一个实例，所以不做封禁\r\n2. 如果是集群模式（NamingService+LB方式初始化Channel），则尝试以排除当前实例的条件下SelectServer，如果这种条件下选不出实例，或者选出实例仍为当前实例，则说明当前实例为LB内部唯一可用的实例，在这种情况下不做封禁\r\n二、防止重试去重或LB调权导致的E112：在选择实例的时候，增加一次额外的尝试\r\n1. 即使LB内部存在可用的实例，也有可能因为重试去重或LB调权的原因无法选中。解决方法为在选择实例的时候，如果返回E112，则改变选择条件：excluded_server=NULL, changable_weights=false，以这种条件重新选择，如果LB内部存在可用实例，则一定能够选择出实例。\r\n\r\n注意：以上方案仅对连接池和短连接模式下生效，单连接的情况下，main socket和rpc实际通信的socket是同一个，通信过程可能有各种原因导致socket被SetFail，从而导致main socket失效，无法被LB选择。解决该问题的根本办法是将单连接的main socket和rpc通信的socket进行拆分（有点类似于只有一个连接的连接池），当rpc通信socket SetFailed之后，可以从main socket新建新的socket进行连接，但这个方案对brpc的改动较大。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: N/A\r\n\r\nProblem Summary: \r\n- The entire GitHub workflow is run, even for changes that do not require a build, such as for markdown file changes. This [PR](https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2153) is an example of the entire workflow being run for an update to the `oncall.md` file. It takes approximately 30 minutes for the entire Github CI workflow to run and developers commit a standalone markdown file change at least 2 times per month.\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n- Update GitHub workflow files to skip the `ci-linux` and `ci-macos` workflows for pushes and pull requests when the only changes are to markdown files. The result is less time spent waiting for builds to pass on both pushes and pull requests for Markdown file changes, which currently takes 30 minutes. Now, only the license check should run, which takes under 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响): N/A\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): No\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow

Summary:\r\n一些编译器会优化 thread_local 的变量的读写，在同一个函数中间如果再次获取相同变量的值时，会直接从缓存的地址里面进行加载。但是如果在函数过程中间，线程发生切换（ bthread 切换到另一个线程执行)，那么 thread_local 变量需要重新获当前运行线程的，而不应该使用之前的旧值。\r\n\r\n经测试，Apple M1 Apple clang

effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n1. 新增 `NOT_ALLOW_OPTIMIZE_THREAD_LOCAL_ACCESS` 用于控制是否允许编译器优化，如果为 true 是，对应的  thread local 变量必须通过 noinline 的函数调用方式来获取最新值，绕开编译器的优化。\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n如果开启 `NOT_ALLOW_OPTIMIZE_THREAD_LOCAL_ACCESS` , 会造成多一次的函数调用开销。\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n无\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\n原PR: [mongo client ](https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/1808)\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/1807\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n原PR：\r\n- 引入了bson库并将相关操作封装到butil\r\n- 在mongo.{h|cpp} 中为 Mongodb 的 curd 操作增加了对应的protobuff message\r\n- 为 mongo protocol 增加了客户端的支持\r\n- 为 mongo 多副本集群增加了 mongo naming service，定期更新集群中的主节点\r\n\r\n后续修改:\r\n- 去掉了原PR中一些不必要的缩进修改，避免diff被干扰\r\n- 将 MongoQueryRequest/MongoInsertRequest 等消息做了简单抽象\r\n- 让 mongo_protocol.cpp 的相关代码更简洁\r\n- 支持直接使用 Makefile 编译\r\n\r\n已知的问题/讨论：\r\n-  debian/ubuntu下bson库的目录及文件带着'-1.0'这样的后缀，会导致从config_brpc._sh报错，目前手动去掉这个后缀在work around, 后续修复\r\n- mongo 协议自身前后不兼容，brpc 现在已有的服务端的支持版本很旧，而且意义不明（应该不会有人再在自己写个mongodb了吧）, 原来的pr是按照较新的协议实现的，eg, 新版协议仅支持OP_MSG 和 OP_COMPRESSED，OP_MSG的枚举值还变了，这样的话服务端代码可能也要更新\r\n- MongoRquest/MongoResponse的消息名字和服务端的pb定义重名了，这里因为不太清楚服务端支持的mongo协议的背景，先就没有做修改\r\n- 协议解析部分看issue是通过抓包测出来的，目前看支持的不太全，我尽量找找文档或者官方client的处理吧。\r\n- 一些todo和缩进没来得及全部处理完\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\nno\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n影响使用 mongo procotol 的服务\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #2123 \r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\nConsulNamingService其实不是PeriodicNamingService，不是简单的轮询，而是[长轮询](https://brpc.incubator.apache.org/zh/docs/client/basics/#consulservice-name)，每次rpc成功后，立即发起下一次长轮询。只有失败了，才会sleep。\r\n   [Blocking Queries](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/api-docs/features/blocking)：\r\n   > Many endpoints in Consul support a feature known as \"blocking queries\". A blocking query is used to wait for a potential change using long polling.\r\n  \r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n回退#2123 ConsulNamingService的改动\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n`std::lock_guard<typename std::remove_reference<T>::type> get_lock_guard();` \r\n我对这里的实现不太理解：为什么要通过定义一个 get_lock_guard 函数（我理解是个函数？），来多套了一层？\r\n我理解这里的目的是为了在传入引入类型时，把引用去掉。直接用这个 mr 中改动的代码，看起来也没有问题。\r\n也怀疑可能是不同的操作系统或者编译器对 lock_guard 或者 remove_reference 的实现有区别，不过看这个 mr 的 check，在 linux 和 mac 上针对 g++ 和 clang 都能编译成功，看起来也不是操作系统或者编译器的问题。\r\n哪位大佬能帮忙解答下 get_lock_guard 的目的么？\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #584\r\n\r\nProblem Summary: 继承自PeriodicNamingService的ns，例如DiscoveryNamingService、NacosNamingService、RemoteFileNamingService，在GetServers中通过rpc拉取节点的时候，NamingServiceThread析构调用bthread_stop并不能中断CallMethod，CallMethod只是被唤醒了一下，而且将interrupted置回为false，CallMethod依然会等到rpc结束。但是这时候bthread_usleep已经不能感知到bthread_interrupt而退出了。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\n1. PeriodicNamingService通过判断bthread_stopped来退出。\r\n2. ConsulNamingService本质上是一个PeriodicNamingService，将其抽象为PeriodicNamingService的派生类。\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性):

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary: Support c++20 coroutine\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged: New feature\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n   - Use `example/coroutine`, start server with `taskset -c 1 ./coroutine_server -enable_coroutine=1 -sleep_us=100`, start rpc_press with `../../tools/rpc_press/rpc_press -proto=./echo.proto -method=example.EchoService.Proxy -input='{\"message\":\"hello\"}' -qps=0 -thread_num=100 -duration=0 -server=0.0.0.0:8000 -timeout_ms=2000 -connection_type=pooled`, the result is :<img width=\"408\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3894631/218682692-d525d07e-3d34-4413-b6e7-2dc0d386756f.png\">\r\n  - When start coroutine_server with `-enable_coroutine=0`, the result is :<img width=\"419\" alt=\"image\"

sync version.\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): No\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary: \r\n1. In performance test, using rdma may cost more cpu than TCP because of more bthreads.\r\n2. In a very rare case, the ibv_post_send operation may fail because of full SQ.\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged: \r\n1. Reduce the bthread_flush called.\r\n2. Introduce redundant SQ size to avoid SQ overflow caused by unsignaled WQE.\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):  CPU overhead will be reduced in rdma_performance.\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): None\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of
