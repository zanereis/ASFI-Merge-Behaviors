[neo4j-kernel](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j) from 3.4.11 to 5.3.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/releases\">neo4j-kernel's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Neo4j 1.9.0 stable release</h2>\n<p>The 1.9 release of Neo4j builds upon the previous 1.8 releases and brings extensive improvements in stability and performance. In addition, <em>Neo4j 1.9 Enterprise</em> introduces auto-clustering support, with dramatically simplified configuration and deployment for high demand production use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/ha.html\">auto-clustering in <em>Neo4j Enterprise</em></a>, which replaces the previous Zookeeper based HA clustering, provides a streamlined deployment process and is much safer and more resilient in failure scenarios.</li>\n<li>New <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/arbiter-instances.html\">neo4j-arbiter</a> tool, which acts as a voting instance in a Neo4j cluster but does not keep a data store or handle transactions.</li>\n<li>Addition of <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/query-function.html\">string manipulation, timestamp and other functions</a> to the Cypher query language.</li>\n<li>Improvements to memory utilization, which reduces working memory requirements and improves overall performance.</li>\n<li>New <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/ha-rest-info.html\">REST endpoints for inspecting cluster status information</a> (master, slave, etc).</li>\n<li>Correction of several concurrency and performance issues.</li>\n<li>Improvements to <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/operations-backup.html\">Online Backup</a> in <em>Neo4j Enterprise</em>, including auto-detection of full vs incremental backup based on existing content at the backup location.</li>\n<li>Updates to Neo4j server webadmin, including welcome pages for new users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>It is recommended to upgrade all previous Neo4j installations to this release.</strong> Neo4j 1.9 does not require any explicit upgrade to persistent stores created using Neo4j 1.7 and 1.8 installations, however <em>current users of Neo4j Enterprise must consult the documentation and update the cluster configuration</em>.

the GLV's docker compose files to additionally run gremlin-socket-server during integration testing.\r\n\r\nConfigures each of the GLVs to import the default config yaml for gremlin socket server.\r\n\r\nAdds at least one reference test in each GLV which demonstrates it's use.\r\n\r\nAlso modifies gremlin-socket-server slightly to allow for any of graphSON2, graphSON3, or graphBinaryV1 to be used. Previously gremlin socket server only used graphSON2.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the tests implemented here are quite basic as this PR was mostly focused on setting up the configuration to enable the tests. Even so several bugs were discovered when creating these tests. More tests which emulate network errors or connection issues would be a great benefit.","created_at":"2022-12-20T01:22:33Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T20:14:44Z","closed_at":"2022-12-22T23:05:06Z","merged_at":"2022-12-22T23:05:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"713c5726faec36c19f3e299bdc399912d21ff1d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/0f578cf090edf1acd3ec62da209c2f4064f1871c","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/socket-server-refactor-glv-tests","ref":"cole/socket-server-refactor-glv-tests","sha":"0f578cf090edf1acd3ec62da209c2f4064f1871c","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

believe this fix is small enough for review to be done in CTR fashion. If any commiter agrees with this I would like to merge this in without a lengthy initial review.\r\n\r\nFixes a bug where python and go glv's were not using the correct request_id when overriden. This is detailed in TINKERPOP-2841 and TINKERPOP-2844. This commit is not sufficient to close those tickets as further investigation is needed to ensure the other per-request settings work as intended, this commit provides an immediate fix to the broken request_id functionality.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes a typo in the python reference

is a followup to the previous Socket Server Refactor PR. The last PR created the new modules but tried to avoid any breaking changes in case there is ever a need to backport some of these changes to earlier releases. This PR introduces all of the intended breaking changes to complete the refactor.\r\n\r\nThe list of changes is very long and repetitive so I will do my best to summarize them here.\r\n\r\n1. Every class in the gremlin-util module had it's package changed from *.gremlin.driver.* to *.gremlin.util.* The complete list of these classes can be found in the JIRA.\r\n2. All imports and usages of these classes throughout the tinkerpop repo have been updated to reflect the new locations.\r\n3. All server config.yaml files which have a serializers section have been updated with the new serializer location.\r\n4. All references to the migrated classes in the docs (excluding upgrade docs for old releases) have been updated with the new package names.\r\n5. Every class in the gremlin-socket-server module had it's package changed from *.gremlin.driver.* to *.gremlin.socket.server.*\r\n6. All usages of socket server classes have been updated accordingly.\r\n7. gremlin-driver has been removed as a dependency of gremlin-server. (It now has a scope of test)\r\n\r\nThat last point is arguably the most significant and could easily be lost in the sea of repetitive changes. All of the classes which previously had required gremlin-driver to be a server dependency have been migrated to gremlin-util (Note: gremlin-util was added as a server dependency with the first socket server refactor PR). This refactor removes the requirement to package the driver with the server.","created_at":"2022-12-09T17:58:46Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T20:14:53Z","closed_at":"2022-12-14T00:12:17Z","merged_at":"2022-12-14T00:12:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"1777f3964b8c833ad8d8d5019e599e581ba9c41a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1897/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1897/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1897/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/7318fc5a1068ce9242b42c49d7937f97d747ce2d","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/socket-server-refactor-3.7","ref":"cole/socket-server-refactor-3.7","sha":"7318fc5a1068ce9242b42c49d7937f97d747ce2d","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

towards [TINKERPOP-2480](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2480)\r\n\r\nAdds a user agent to gremlin-javascript which is sent as a request header during the web socket handshake.\r\n\r\nUser agent follows the form of [Application Name] [GLV Name].[Version] [Language Runtime Version] [OS].[Version] [CPU Architecture]\r\n\r\nThis behavior is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting the enableUserAgentOnConnect option to false.\r\n\r\nNote: There are no tests included as part of this PR. My intention is to add integration tests to ensure that the user agent is being sent correctly once [TINKERPOP-2819](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2819) has been merged. The existing javascript glv tests are sufficient to show that this change does not introduce any faults into the driver. I have conducted manual tests to ensure that the changes are currently functioning correctly. My thoughts are that with a potential release approaching, it is worthwhile to have the user agent introduced now, with full validation coming soon.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a configuration section to the JS reference documentation in order to be consistent with the other GLV's. The configuration table is populated based on the JSDoc comments from the Connection, Client, and DriverRemoteConnection

the major points of the change in the Upgrade Docs. Might be best to start there if reviewing this. Made some other adjustments to log better data for debugging purposes with the `ConnectionPool`.  Ended up making a number of adjustments to the thread pools to which various jobs were being submitted. Untangling that led to the addition of two pools which helped bring back parallel host initialization and got rid of random usage of the fork/join pool. I sense that something could be done to eliminate some of these pools but I believe it will come at the cost of a much larger refactoring effort to untangle how some of these jobs get scheduled up. I dunno.....not super pleased with it but gotta go pencils down at some point.\r\n\r\nthere've been many days of continuous testing on these changes at this point from various folks and all results

towards [TINKERPOP-2480](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2480)\r\n\r\nAdds a user agent to gremlin-python which is sent as a request header during the web socket handshake.\r\n\r\nUser agent follows the form of [Application Name] [GLV Name].[Version] [Language Runtime Version] [OS].[Version] [CPU Architecture]\r\n\r\nThis behavior is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting the enable_user_agent_on_connect configuration to false.\r\n\r\nNote: There are no tests included as part of this PR. My intention is to add integration tests to ensure that the user agent is being sent correctly once [TINKERPOP-2819](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2819) has been merged. The existing python glv tests are sufficient to show that this change does not introduce any faults into the driver. I have conducted manual tests to ensure that the changes are currently functioning correctly. My thoughts are that with a potential release approaching, it is worthwhile to have the user agent introduced now, with full validation coming soon.","created_at":"2022-11-29T23:05:38Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T20:15:23Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T22:13:01Z","merged_at":"2022-12-05T22:13:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"ea67b9e64a16d89a59abb621a5f3c9fb5b126639","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1879/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1879/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1879/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/8221e16c64a342963d49e162cf7f22fe749f0d24","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/user-agent-python","ref":"cole/user-agent-python","sha":"8221e16c64a342963d49e162cf7f22fe749f0d24","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

towards [TINKERPOP-2480](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2480)\r\n\r\nAdds a user agent to gremlin-go which is sent as a request header during the web socket handshake.\r\n\r\nUser agent follows the form of [Application Name] [GLV Name].[Version] [Language Runtime Version] [OS].[Version] [CPU Architecture]\r\n\r\nThis behavior is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting the EnableUserAgentOnConnect setting to false.\r\n\r\nNote: There are no tests included as part of this PR. My intention is to add integration tests to ensure that the user agent is being sent correctly once [TINKERPOP-2819](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2819) has been merged. The existing go glv tests are sufficient to show that this change does not introduce any faults into the driver. I have conducted manual tests to ensure that the changes are currently functioning correctly. My thoughts are that with a potential release approaching, it is worthwhile to have the user agent introduced now, with full validation coming soon.","created_at":"2022-11-29T00:39:34Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T20:16:31Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T22:09:34Z","merged_at":"2022-12-05T22:09:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"0abbc650e02eb0286d2a08209234cf5cfa812b0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1877/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1877/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1877/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/dd5f49b3c8915a7c088f995d81e6b3b2651f47a4","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/user-agent-go","ref":"cole/user-agent-go","sha":"dd5f49b3c8915a7c088f995d81e6b3b2651f47a4","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

The existing dotnet glv tests are sufficient to show that this change does not introduce any faults into the driver. I have conducted manual tests to ensure that the changes are currently functioning correctly. My thoughts are that with a potential release approaching, it is worthwhile to have the user agent introduced now, with full validation coming soon.","created_at":"2022-11-28T20:38:20Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T20:16:33Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T22:03:35Z","merged_at":"2022-12-05T22:03:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"7e551b8d1318af9457ab1619e2181f58273c19b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1876/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1876/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1876/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/da7ab3a5cfe21fb83447b352bed9085d775f4bf5","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/user-agent-dotnet","ref":"cole/user-agent-dotnet","sha":"da7ab3a5cfe21fb83447b352bed9085d775f4bf5","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

So, many users are probably still not using them.\r\n\r\nAdding the annotations also in tests revealed two (well actually three) more places where `null` should be allowed in Gremlin.Net itself: In `Traversal.Equals()` and in the `From()`/`To()` steps if the argument is a `Vertex`. While `null` is still not really allowed there, Gremlin throws a more meaningful exception message if it gets `null` and we might change that in the future to somehow allow `null` maybe.\r\n\r\nVOTE

only adds nullable annotations to the projects Gremlin.Net and the Gremlin.Net.Template, but not to the test projects. I intend to add it there in a follow-up PR to at least somehow limit the scope of this commit. This takes already care of everything user-facing.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunately includes a few breaking changes (not necessarily complete):\r\n- Message types:\r\n  * Some set property accessors removed\r\n- Structure types:\r\n  * Some set property accessors removed\r\n- `DefaultTraversal.Bytecode` now abstract\r\n- `GraphBinaryReader`/`Writer`\r\n  * `ReadValueAsync` / `WriteValueAsync` were split into two methods, for nullable and non-nullable values\r\n- Changed exceptions: Instead of `NullReferenceExceptions`, `IOExceptions` should be thrown during serialization\r\n\r\nMost of these breaking changes are also mentioned in the upgrade docs. I haven't added all of them there as I found it to be unlikely that anyone is really affected by them.\r\n\r\nVOTE

PR represents a significant restructuring of gremlin-driver. The intention behind these changes is to make SimpleSocketServer usable by all of the GLV's and work towards bringing the GLV's up to the same testing standards as the java driver. This commit aims to do so without introducing any breaking changes such that the benefits of improved testing can be realized sooner. Further breaking changes may be in order in some release where it is permittable. The changes are detailed below:\r\n\r\nMoved Simple-Socket-Server and related initializer classes from gremlin-driver into a new module gremlin-tools/gremlin-socket-server. This is so other GLV's can depend on the socket server for testing without depending on the whole gremlin-driver. In this change the classes are only moved, the package remains tinkerpop.gremlin.driver to avoid breaking any code which uses these classes.\r\n\r\nA new gremlin-util module is created to house any code which is to be shared between gremlin-driver, gremlin-server, and gremlin-socket-server. Previously all of these shared classes (such as serializers and RequestMessage...) were part of gremlin-driver (which is a dependency of gremlin-server). These classes needed to be extracted to a new module to prevent a cyclic dependency between gremlin-driver and gremlin-socket-server. This structure also removes the need for gremlin-server to depend on gremlin-driver although this dependency should remain for the time being to avoid breaking any users who may indirectly use gremlin-driver classes through the server.\r\n\r\nBuilds SimpleSocketServer into a docker image and moves hardcoded constants for the server port and custom request id's into a config yaml. These changes bring gremlin-socket-server into a state which can be utilized by all of the GLV's as opposed to only the java driver.","created_at":"2022-11-03T19:03:08Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T20:15:09Z","closed_at":"2022-12-07T20:19:40Z","merged_at":"2022-12-07T20:19:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"077a23eb56d8a79b196c82f50875a34b87f3c1b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/f5b6abb89e5846768ffe702c1d3842e5d29abed5","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/socket-server-refactor-3.5","ref":"cole/socket-server-refactor-3.5","sha":"f5b6abb89e5846768ffe702c1d3842e5d29abed5","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache
