PR is a response to pretty catastrophic issue caused by expiring key on MySQL repository on 14th of December. Oracle does not follow the best practices for signing their packages (while all others do) and their packages and repositories are signed with a key with short expiry date. This basically puts an expiry on their repository, and anyone who releases images following best practices of installation, while keeping the repository after installing mysql libraries has to rebuild their past released images every 2 years or so.\r\n\r\nThis is the last straw for our MySQL client installation problems (we had a few, especially for ARM images) and we decided that we will switch to MariaDB client libraries by default (while allowing our users to build custom images with MySQL libraries).\r\n\r\nThe issue tracked in Airflow repository is: #36231\r\n\r\nThe issues in Oracle's MySQL repo:\r\n\r\n* https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=113427\r\n* https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=113428\r\n* https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=113432\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a number of changes:\r\n\r\n* MariaDB client is now default client used for both ARM and X86\r\n* both pre-2023 and 2023 keys for MySQL are now added to be trusted when custom image with MySQL client is built\r\n* MySQL repository is removed after installing MySQL (to avoid repeating similar fiasco for MySQL users in 2025\r\n* changelog added and instructions on how to build custom image with MySQL client\r\n* one of our test suites is converted to use \"current\" image not latest released image (that was bug in our CI).\r\n* test was added in `canary` and `release` builds in CI to also test build of custom image with MySQL client\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

happened\r\n\r\nSchedulers are racing for pod adoption when there is a delay in schedulers' heartbeats. However, the schedulers are alive but not dead their heartbeat is delayed due to network timeout or heavy processing, etc. This leads to a leak in the executor.running_tasks slots. Eventually, the schedulers are not able to launch the pods due to executor.running_tasks reaches maximum  parallelism.\r\n\r\nWhat you think should happen instead\r\n\r\nWe should remove the entry

this does in effect is revert #34412.  I created this PR simply do demonstrate that when we remove the code added in #34412, the tests added in that PR still pass. Which means that either the tests are wrong, or the code is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI am trying to clean up KPO logging logic a bit, and resolve some problems we've encountered with logs hanging.  But I don't want to regress #34412.  So I need either its tests to work properly, or to conclude that the logic doesn't do anything and we can remove

This class simply extends from the SmtpNotifier and defaults a number of the required arguments (like email_from, subject, and html_content). The latter two variables are pulled from airflow/settings.py.\r\n\r\nOn the template itself, I was initially thinking of having at least three distinct templates following https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/35381#issuecomment-1792108885 but it's simple to add a condition to detect whether we are sending an SLA miss or a failure/success/retry email so I decided on using a single template. Happy to change that approach if the community thinks having distinct templates are cleaner.\r\n\r\nWill work on tests after the approach is generally agreed upon.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nSample dag used to test emails -\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport datetime\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom airflow.providers.smtp.notifications.smtp import

max_active_tasks=1,\r\n    max_active_runs=1,\r\n    sla_miss_callback=SmtpNotifier(from_email=None, to=\"xyz@gmail.com\"),\r\n):\r\n    BashOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"task\",\r\n

there are [three](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-apache-hive/stable/connections/hive_cli.html#configuring-the-connection) options to add proxy user to hive cli connection: by dag owner, by connection logging or by custom proxy (as extra in the connection).\r\n\r\nThis PR add a fourth option param proxy user. by setting `proxy_user=param` in connection allow us to pass the user in HiveOperator.\r\nI think this PR is needed from some option:\r\n1. The user proxy is not as the same name as the owner, we want to seperate the \"owner\" and the \"proxy_user\"\r\n2. If we want to use few HiveOperator with different proxy_user in the same dag\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded an option to sent proxy_param in HiveOperator when allow it in the connection.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

API](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/common/sql/doc/adr/0002-return-common-data-structure-from-dbapihook-derived-hooks.md) specifies that DbApiHooks needs to return a

https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/providers-google/10.13.0rc2/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/gcs.py#L732, I suspect we might not use the `delimiter` the right way. But it's going to be deprecated. So it might be better for us to keep the original behavior.\r\n\r\nAccording to https://github.com/googleapis/python-storage/blob/v2.14.0/google/cloud/storage/client.py#L1213-L1217, the prefixes are not returned until the `blobs` are consumed. Thus, to keep the behavior of checking whether `prefixes` exists and decide the extended content, we'll need to consume `blobs` first\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36130\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

credentials are loaded once at the initialization of the ECS Executor, and those credentials are used to authenticate to the ECS API. If those credentials expire, the Executor will not able to schedule new tasks, or update existing ones. There is no way to reload the credentials except by restarting the scheduler. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to allow the Executor to refresh its credentials if they expire. It includes an exponential backoff retry method that retries the credentials based on the previous attempt so that the API has a chance to work through any transient issues, and to not unnecessarily spam the API if the credentials are genuinely expired. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR extends the `message_filtering` parameter to the `SqsSensor` to add a third type of filtering: `jsonpath-ext`.  The existing JSONPath filtering functionality in `SqsSensor` uses the `jsonpath_ng.parse` method for constructing the JSONPath engine to search for matching values.  This particular engine supports only a subset of the JSONPath language and is missing useful features, such as the ability to retrieve the values for multiple fields at a time.  The new `jsonpath-ext` option uses the `jsonpath_ng.ext.parse` builder instead, which unlocks the full capabilities of the `jsonpath_ng` library.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-11T15:53:04Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T18:33:34Z","closed_at":"2023-12-11T18:33:30Z","merged_at":"2023-12-11T18:33:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"e37fe8f5769ec6509b82774493b0b3dd6316c03b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"o-nikolas","id":65743084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65743084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas","html_url":"https://github.com/o-nikolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

releaed new version (1.7.6) few days ago. We had >=1.7.5 and it started to detect new potential issue (Auto Add Hostkey) in Google and SSH providers. Both case are valid however (in the first case the key is a throw-away one and just - dynamically - created so we cannot have it stored yet. Auto-Adding makes sense in this case. In case of SSH provider, the user must deliberately choose this option and they are clearly warned that it is not secure option.\r\n\r\nWe are also fixing bandit to a pinned version. The problem with\r\n>= in case of pre-commit is that the result might depend on cache\r\nof pre-commit - in main we are still using 1.7.5 as it has been cached, but new PRs use 1.7.6 because they have no access to main cache.\r\n\r\nWe will have a separate pre-commit added to make sure that we are updating to latest versions of other pre-commits soon. We need to make sure we are updating those deliberately.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

of recently, we have a possibility to schedule providers for removal. They should be removed once they got released the last time - with the removal note added to the documentation. We had a special step in the process to generate documentation and build packages, but this is pretty easy to forget it and miss such package when release is prepared.\r\n\r\nWe modify the tooling slightly - removed providers will be included in release preparation even if they are techniclaly suspended and would be excluded (if they were not removed).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

change #36131 when switching to docker-compose based running of scripts introduced a subtle race condition when several docker-compose runs were running in paralell and used the same project_name. This happened for example in case of constraints generation - when running two Python constraints generation caused docker network to be created two times.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem for the cases where such run are run in parallel - by giving each of the parallel commands unique project_name.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

command options in breeze have been rather badly organized. The \"common_option\" in utils package was misplaced and it contained a lot of options that were not really \"common\" - only used in one or two commands.\r\n\r\nThis PR reorganizes those options by making a bit more reasonable decisions where options are placed:\r\n\r\n* when options are used by a single command - they are defined in that command\r\n* when options are used by more commands in the same command module, they are defined in that command module - at the top\r\n* in cases of \"image\" and \"package_installation\" optins - they are used by several modules only and they have their own \"common_\"*\" modules\r\n* only in case a command is used in multiple modules, they are put in \"common_options\".\r\n* the \"common_options\" module has been moved to \"commands\" package (it makes much more sense to be there - together with all commands\r\n* the command options are sorted alphabetically in their corresponding files.\r\n* Fixed missing default for \"--platform\" flag\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Description\r\nCurrently there are some arguments which are being provided using Spark Connection,\r\nbut there is no way to override them in **SparkSubmitOperator** and **SparkSubmitHook**\r\neg.\r\n--queue: option specifies the YARN queue to which the application should be submitted.\r\n--deploy-mode: option specified deploy mode client/cluster\r\n\r\nmore -

The old regex would substitute the` .` with a `\\\\...` and so, the path mentioned would become `airlow\\\\..example`. This new string would be passed as the pattern to be matched, but what it does is match  the word `airflow`, followed by a literal `.`, then the second `.` would act as a wildcard to match any character, followed by the word `example`. Therefore, the original string   `airflow.example` would not match this pattern, because it would be missing an extra character after the `.` and before the word `example`. For example, a class such as `airflow.texample` would match in a path such as the one given before. This error was not caught before, because the test cases didn't include paths with `.` in the middle, only in the end.\r\n\r\nThe solution for this issue, as discussed in the PR comments, was to refactor how the flag works. Now, instead of accepting both glob and regex patterns (and then transforming glob patterns into a regexp, in a complex manner), the `allowed_deserialization_classes` flag now only accepts glob patterns. \r\n\r\nIf the user still wants to use regexp to determine their allowed deserialization classes, they can use the new flag `allowed_deserialization_classes_regexp`. In this way, the code will first try to match the classes with a glob pattern, and if it fails will try to match it with a regexp.\r\n\r\nThese 2 different flags maintain the flexibility that was the goal for PR #28829, simplifying code and test readability, allowing future developers to understand easier whats going on, not needing to understand a complex nesting of regex transformations.\r\n\r\nSo that these changes could be tested and the functionality evidenced, the unit tests for the serialization were touched and new unit tests were added.\r\n\r\nCloses: #34093

were using constraints from GitHub repository \"constraints-main\" branch when installing and testing providers in main. However, when we are testing providers in their \"main\" form, we should use the constraints that were used in the current build. In case we are upgrading the constraints, constraints from main are different than the one CI image build - and we should use those.\r\n\r\nInstead of getting the constraints from main, we are using the CI image to generate the constraints to \"/files/constraints*\" and when installing providers we point to those constraints instead of using the \"main\" constraints.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

release manager generates provider packages, sources for them are temporarily copied to subfolders of `dist\\provider_packages`.\r\n\r\nGenerally we remove all such code (unless\r\n`--skip-deleting-generated-files` flag is used) - and we do it for the sources but we do not delete `provider_packages` folder and subfolders coming from packages in `apache` and few other nested provider packages. This causes some warnings when packages are being signed as the provider_packages directory is attempted to be signed (and fails).\r\n\r\nWe remove the generated folder now unless the `--skip*` flag is used.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

far we executed commands in CI image in breeze in two ways:\r\n\r\n* entering the shell (which runs docker-compose under the hood)\r\n* running `docker run` with the CI image\r\n\r\nThis requires rather complex mapping of environment variables\r\nbetween `docker-compose` and `docker`. Since recently (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/35862)\r\nwe can use `shell` command to run commands in very similar way\r\nas docker run (with docker-compose, without database and extra\r\ncomponents - just using the same `breeze shell` mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThis PR converts all the usages of docker run CI_IMAGE we had\r\nand converts them to use modified `enter_shell` method that has\r\nbeen moved to \"docker_command_utils\". This also simplified\r\npassing arguments to the \"enter_shell\" command - no longer need\r\nto filter out none parameters and **kwargs - all parameters are\r\npassed explicitly.\r\n\r\nThis also allowed to remove some of the code (extracting args,\r\nfiltering_out_none) that are not used anymore.\r\n\r\nThe entypoint CI has been slightly refactored - to provide\r\na bit better structure and handle `--skip-environment-initialization`\r\nbetter - we can now both set `--use-airflow-version` and\r\n`--skip-environment-initialization` which was not possible\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

fixes the issue raised [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/34919#issuecomment-1846993082) against https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/34919\r\n\r\nWhen testing locally the list only appears to be required when a delimiter is passed in. \r\n\r\nA sample test can be performed with:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.providers.google.cloud.hooks.gcs import GCSHook\r\nres = GCSHook().list(\r\n        bucket_name='a-testbucket',\r\n        prefix='a/prefix/in/the/bucket/'\r\n)\r\nprint(res)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this fix, the code no longer fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: ('Iterator has already started', <google.api_core.page_iterator.HTTPIterator object at 0x7efe067c3880>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo confirm that this block:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                if delimiter:\r\n                    list(blobs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs still required, when this is removed, and this is ran:\r\n```\r\nres = GCSHook().list(\r\n        bucket_name='a-testbucket',\r\n        prefix='a/prefix/in/the/bucket/',\r\n        delimiter='.csv'\r\n)\r\nprint(res)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo results are returned.

allows to tests the scripts that require --mount-sources remove but you run some scripts inside the container (for example this was the case when modifying installation of airflow and providers to be

change #35856 optimized waiting time before PROD image builds start - rather than waiting for full constratints generation, the PROD image building just used source constraints generated right after building the CI image quickly. This is fine for main because there we install airflow and packages using constraints from sources, but for release branches we use the provider constraints - in order to be able to install providers from PyPI rather than from sources.\r\n\r\nThis means that we have to wait for constraints generation to complete before we start building PROD images - because we need to download the constraints generated there to use them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately GitHub Actions do not have conditional dependencies depending on where the workflow is run  - so instead we have to effectively duplicate PROD build steps and skip steps in them instead.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

change #35856 optimized waiting time before PROD image builds start - rather than waiting for full constratints generation, the PROD image building just used source constraints generated right after building the CI image quickly. This is fine for main because there we install airflow and packages using constraints from sources, but for release branches we use the provider constraints - in order to be able to install providers from PyPI rather than from sources.\r\n\r\nThis means that we have to wait for constraints generation to complete before we start building PROD images - because we need to download the constraints generated there to use them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately GitHub Actions do not have conditional dependencies depending on where the workflow is run  - so instead we have to effectively duplicate PROD build steps and skip steps in them instead.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
