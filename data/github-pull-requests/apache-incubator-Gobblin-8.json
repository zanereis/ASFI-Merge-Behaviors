Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1534\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently in both gaas and jobs launched by gaas, we use kafka event reporting, but not kafka metrics reporting. In #3035, there were some changes which includes splitting the kafka reporter factory. As a side effect, the two reporters (metrics/events) became all or nothing, where previously if just one was missing config it would be skipped. This causes gaas and jobs launched by gaas to always contain an error stacktrace about failing to instantiate the kafka metric reporter.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds config keys to enable/disable the reporters individually. For backwards compatibility, if `metrics.reporting.kafka.enabled` is true, they will both be enabled.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested in local gaas\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-03T01:45:53Z","updated_at":"2021-09-07T18:14:16Z","closed_at":"2021-09-07T18:14:16Z","merged_at":"2021-09-07T18:14:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"bea281712ad86f31634d5f6441fc492639cdf346","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3386/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3386/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3386/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3e9dc7e6d6dd51411b89451956119cdb36a76d0a","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:kafka-metrics","ref":"kafka-metrics","sha":"3e9dc7e6d6dd51411b89451956119cdb36a76d0a","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1530\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWhen copying data from a source node that does not exist/fails to be added to GaaS FlowGraph, a very cryptic error message pops up where DmasAuthorizer shows a NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nThis PR guards against source nodes that do not exist so that the error is much easier for developers and users to understand.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-01T22:33:17Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T07:38:51Z","closed_at":"2021-09-08T17:43:14Z","merged_at":"2021-09-08T17:43:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"601312dec3f1716e5a60e4e52ec8801be7e8fe06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3381/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3381/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3381/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/c9d8d0ec6472def9dd024fda018163b2bd6362c2","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:improve-error-reporting-source-node-missing","ref":"improve-error-reporting-source-node-missing","sha":"c9d8d0ec6472def9dd024fda018163b2bd6362c2","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1529\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nIn scenarios where there are a large number of scheduled jobs, it may take too long (measured in hours) to fully demote the past leader to unschedule all of its jobs incrementally. This can cause duplicate flow executions and inconsistent behavior. Instead we should bulk delete all schedules.\r\n\r\nIn the future we can investigate an option where past leaders keep their schedules in memory and periodically synchronize their in-memory schedulers from MySQL and prevent them from actually executing or doing work, but there is no simple way of doing this right now as each scheduler would also have to account for updates/deletes to other hosts.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-31T19:12:00Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T07:38:30Z","closed_at":"2021-09-01T23:57:16Z","merged_at":"2021-09-01T23:57:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9d22225ff34d534322e1c33675aa3d34f995969","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3380/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3380/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3380/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3b55ad1961036dd89f522839873d5530034dba5a","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:clear-scheduler-bulk","ref":"clear-scheduler-bulk","sha":"3b55ad1961036dd89f522839873d5530034dba5a","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1582\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin can overallocate containers when a Yarn application is started up. The main reason for the overallocation is because the AMRM client does not track which container requests have already been submitted. Container requests are sent to RM through the allocate() method inside the AMRMClient. Once a container has been allocated, the application is responsible for removing the container request from the matching request table (maintained by the AMRMClient) by calling its removeContainerRequest() method. Between successive calls to allocate() method, if one or more container requests have not been removed from matching request table, the requests may be resent to RM resulting in over-allocation of containers (See: [YARN-1902](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1902)). Gobblin-on-Yarn itself uses async implementation of AMRMClient wherein a heartbeat thread is initialized on client start up to emit periodic heartbeats to RM. On each run of the heartbeat thread, the allocate() method is called and container requests sent to RM. If the heartbeat interval is too small, there is a chance that not all container requests are satisfied by the RM within the interval. Currently, in Gobblin-on-Yarn this interval is set to 1 sec, which has been observed to be very small in production settings resulting in duplicate container requests being sent to RM.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the heartbeat interval configurable and sets the default to 15 seconds, which provides a greater chance for container requests to be satisfied within the interval and the corresponding requests to be removed from the matching requests table.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting tests. Tested a pipeline to request a large number of containers and validated no over-allocation across multiple runs.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-27T22:37:43Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T18:08:46Z","closed_at":"2021-08-30T18:08:46Z","merged_at":"2021-08-30T18:08:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"a18d4e01f9999426c541441ea4d7f88f82c4b2b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3379/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3379/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3379/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4241cbe24fbd6574cb77e27c639a5cadd59106f1","head":{"label":"sv2000:yarnServiceContainerOverAllocation","ref":"yarnServiceContainerOverAllocation","sha":"4241cbe24fbd6574cb77e27c639a5cadd59106f1","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n@aplex @phet  please review\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1522\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe should avoid the use of FlowConfigResourceLocalHandler because it is deprecated in favor of FlowConfigV2ResourceLocalHandler.\r\nGobblinServiceManager currently uses FlowConfigResourceLocalHandler to create ControllerUserDefinedMessageHandlerFactory. The result of this is that when a helix message sent by a slave instance of the master instance is received it is handled by a V1 local handler, which we want to avoid.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntrivial changes\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1521\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nUsing embedded gobblin to run streaming job, and create a guid to help user quickly onboard\r\n* Change kafka09ConsumerClient to make get earliest and latest offset won't change the current position of the consumer, and support assignAndSeek() method\r\n* Change FsStateStore rename method to enable overwrite so that we can write to existing state store\r\n* Change reference in kafka-hdfs-streaming-avro.job to OSS class to give user better idea about how the config looks like if they want to ingest as avro, although we don't use that config in this local job since we don't have schema registry setup.  \r\n* change KafkaStreamingExtractor to support the scenario where schemaRegistry is not setup\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest we can run the job locally\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references it in the PR title:\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1519\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nthis is an internal, implementation-level refactoring that should not modify externally-observable behavior.  it was motivated by the repetitive, near boiler plate for timing each operation in `InstrumentedSpecStore`, as noticed in the recent PR - https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3367 .  it:\r\n\r\n* simplifies that class by DRYing it up through a companion helper class.\r\n* preserves method signatures for source compatibility\r\n* measures nanoseconds, rather than milliseconds, since that is what `metrics.Timer` trades in internally\r\n\r\nthe only *change* is:\r\n\r\n* the newly-added `SpecStore.getSize()` call is now recorded with the suffix `\"-GETCOUNT\"`, to discern it from `\"-GETALL\"`, which it previously used, although the latter was found to be already in use for a different operation - https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3367#discussion_r690792043\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nexisting unit tests, such as `org.apache.gobblin.runtime.spec_store.FSSpecStoreTest.testGetSpecURI`, exercise refactoring and continue to pass\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-18T03:10:39Z","updated_at":"2021-08-20T00:08:00Z","closed_at":"2021-08-20T00:08:00Z","merged_at":"2021-08-20T00:08:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"6691a37d863d35cb5d217355ff8667f29cdb03e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3369/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3369/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3369/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d199157b9077cd49676c9a6d07f7a783d531ec9a","head":{"label":"phet:simplify_InstrumentedSpecStore","ref":"simplify_InstrumentedSpecStore","sha":"d199157b9077cd49676c9a6d07f7a783d531ec9a","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n@jack-moseley  @phet @aplex please review\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1518\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nDuring a memory profiling we noticed that a lot of CPU cycles are used in calling getSpecs().size() from metric reporting thread which runs in every n seconds. Right now there is no API to get size of the spec store.\r\nDoing getAllSpecs and then calling size() over it, does a lot of unnecessary work viz reading the content of spec.\r\nThis PR will provide a method to direct get the size of the spec store without doing any unnecessary work.\r\n\r\nOptions\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-16T23:51:18Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T03:12:34Z","closed_at":"2021-08-17T17:51:47Z","merged_at":"2021-08-17T17:51:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"bea210a70fad93951eedb49590b9bcca4615e255","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3367/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3367/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3367/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/2ee89604d97458a193e45dd1ce9d6275b1505ae8","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:sizeWithoutGetAll","ref":"sizeWithoutGetAll","sha":"2ee89604d97458a193e45dd1ce9d6275b1505ae8","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1517\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently if an error is thrown during recursive renaming, the error message does not contain the from and to path so it's hard to tell exactly which rename of the recursive rename failed. Usually the hadoop IOException contains these paths, but in some cases they do not, so it's better make sure it is printed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\ntrivial message change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-16T23:46:51Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T22:48:56Z","closed_at":"2021-08-17T22:48:56Z","merged_at":"2021-08-17T22:48:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"24cecdd584c503e997292629c750de8bc575c529","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3366/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3366/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3366/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8f8d2e3b926f0f02f27e15e50c93fc4e86bb89d0","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:rename-error","ref":"rename-error","sha":"8f8d2e3b926f0f02f27e15e50c93fc4e86bb89d0","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1516\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR contains two parts: \r\n- Rename `Optional<ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor> writerMetricsUpdater` to be `writerMetricsUpdateExecutor` which is more accurate. The original name collide with `WriterMetricsUpdater` class which is the actual Runnable to be scheduled. \r\n- Within `registerNewTask`, only schedule the `TaskMetricsUpdater` if `metrics.enabled` is true. The `TaskMetricsUpdater` holds a reference to `Task` object and `TaskMetricsUpdater` is only terminated/removed after commit. As a result, when there are a large number of tasks being executed, all of them will only be GC'ed after commit phase. This is particularly not friendly to `AsyncDataWriter` when there are data being buffer until commit. For such application, we might consider disable the writer metric reporting to exchange for more efficient heap usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-13T21:07:51Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T23:06:31Z","closed_at":"2021-08-17T23:06:31Z","merged_at":"2021-08-17T23:06:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"10f1dbd8943a271fc3fb605cd4e5a7553339890a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3365/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3365/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3365/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/da48069af24dd6aac80710ecc67a11255b3f7049","head":{"label":"autumnust:metrics_mem_leakage","ref":"metrics_mem_leakage","sha":"da48069af24dd6aac80710ecc67a11255b3f7049","user":{"login":"autumnust","id":5044213,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDQyMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5044213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust","html_url":"https://github.com/autumnust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60211282,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDIxMTI4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"autumnust/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"autumnust","id":5044213,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDQyMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5044213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust","html_url":"https://github.com/autumnust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/autumnust/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1515\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThere are two issues need to be fixed:\r\n\r\n1. Fix the issue that Hive schema is using avro schema even for orc table: Now, since we directly use avro schema literal to calculate the column and column types for orc table, it sometimes is not correct, so we need to change avro schema to orc schema and compute column types accordingly\r\n\r\n2. Change the behavior that we only evolve avro schema literal but not the hive schema when schema evolution happen: In Streaming, when we do hive registration, we compare the current schema with schema registry and when there is schema evolution, we only update avro schema literal and leave hive schema to be lag. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-13T01:25:35Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T16:50:25Z","closed_at":"2021-08-18T16:50:25Z","merged_at":"2021-08-18T16:50:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"daffe0c2d2c01ef9ca74344593d5c09db50d537a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3364/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3364/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3364/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/40a887fac365973fa779d2be0d69bf1e47b2ebe3","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1515","ref":"GOBBLIN-1515","sha":"40a887fac365973fa779d2be0d69bf1e47b2ebe3","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n- [ ] \r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1509\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nAnnounce flow failure on DagManager::addDag error\r\n\r\nAdditionally, migrate Orchestrator overall away from deprecated EventSubmitter::getTimingEvent factory method.\r\n\r\nPresently, addDag failure leaves the flow marooned in the COMPILED state, as the warranted FLOW_FAILED event is never sent.  Particularly insidious is that scheduled flows with their execution stuck in COMPILED miss their next execution, unless `flow.allowConcurrentExecutions` is set.  Thus the scheduled flow is stuck in its entirety, not merely a single execution.\r\n\r\nOne observed cause of addDag failure is when the DagStateStore is backed by a replicated DB (e.g. MySqlDagStateStore) that just switched leaders.  Cached connections in the pool may suddenly point to a read-only follower unable to DagStateStore::writeCheckpoint.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nManual testing while running GaaS locally:\r\n1. I added a flow to `runImmediatly`, which I soon after observed COMPLETE\r\n2. then I locally patched `DagManager::addDag` to mimic the motivating failure scenario by invariably throwing an `IOException`.\r\n3. I again added the same flow as 1.) (adjusted only to bear a unique name and target location) to `runImmediately`\r\n4. I observed that second flow as FAILED with the shimmed exception conveyed in the message.\r\n\r\na. patched `DagManager`:\r\n```\r\n--- a/gobblin-service/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/service/modules/orchestration/DagManager.java\r\n+++ b/gobblin-service/src/main/java/org/apache/gobblin/service/modules/orchestration/DagManager.java\r\n@@ -263,7 +263,8 @@ public class DagManager extends AbstractIdleService {\r\n   synchronized void addDag(Dag<JobExecutionPlan> dag, boolean persist, boolean setStatus) throws IOException {\r\n     if (persist) {\r\n       //Persist the dag\r\n-      this.dagStateStore.writeCheckpoint(dag);\r\n+      throw new IOException(\"No, I won't add the DAG, dawg!\");\r\n+      // this.dagStateStore.writeCheckpoint(dag);\r\n     }\r\n     int queueId = DagManagerUtils.getDagQueueId(dag, this.numThreads);\r\n     // Add the dag to the specific queue determined by flowExecutionId\r\n```\r\n\r\nb. submitted flow:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": {\r\n    \"flowName\": \"test005\",\r\n    \"flowGroup\": \"testKip\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"templateUris\": \"FS:///\",\r\n  \"properties\": {\r\n    \"gobblin.flow.sourceIdentifier\": \"<<redacted-source>>\",\r\n    \"gobblin.flow.destinationIdentifier\": \"<<(same) redacted-source>>\",\r\n    \"user.to.proxy\": \"gobblintest\",\r\n    \"gobblin.flow.input.dataset.descriptor.path\": \"<<redacted-path>>\",\r\n    \"gobblin.flow.output.dataset.descriptor.path\": \"/tmp/gaas-testing/kip/test005\",\r\n    \"gobblin.flow.input.dataset.descriptor.partition.type\": \"none\",\r\n    \"gobblin.flow.output.dataset.descriptor.partition.type\": \"none\",\r\n    \"gobblin.copy.simulate\": \"false\",\r\n    \"flow.applyRetention\": \"false\",\r\n    \"dataset.datetimePattern\": \"yyyy/MM/dd\",\r\n    \"copy.date.pattern\": \"yyyy/MM/dd\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"schedule\": {\r\n\t\"cronSchedule\": \"0 0 8 * * ? *\",\r\n\t\"runImmediately\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nc.  observed (`FAILED`) status:\r\n```\r\ncurli -k --dv-auth SELF \"https://localhost:6956/sharedgobblinservice/flowexecutions?q=latestFlowExecution&flowId=(flowGroup:testKip,flowName:test005)\" -X GET -H 'X-RestLi-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0'\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n100   361    0   361    0     0     44      0 --:--:--  0:00:08 --:--:--    74\r\n{\r\n    \"elements\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"id\": {\r\n                \"flowGroup\": \"testKip\",\r\n                \"flowExecutionId\": 1628209427967,\r\n                \"flowName\": \"test005\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"message\": \"Failed to add Job Execution Plan due to: No, I won't add the DAG, dawg!\",\r\n            \"executionStatistics\": {\r\n                \"executionEndTime\": 1628209428045,\r\n                \"executionStartTime\": 1628209427967\r\n            },\r\n            \"jobStatuses\": [],\r\n            \"executionStatus\": \"FAILED\"\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"paging\": {\r\n        \"count\": 10,\r\n        \"start\": 0,\r\n        \"links\": []\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-09T21:30:26Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T18:14:11Z","closed_at":"2021-08-12T18:14:11Z","merged_at":"2021-08-12T18:14:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"f54d16ca9397f41c588d7e18cd8e8524ab253718","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3357/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3357/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3357/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/6d496465e52cca555156bf06537dbc6615afc448","head":{"label":"phet:addDag_announce_flow_failure","ref":"addDag_announce_flow_failure","sha":"6d496465e52cca555156bf06537dbc6615afc448","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1507\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWhen demoted from leader, GaaS removes all flows from orchestrator. We need to ensure that fail over events are not disruptive or destructive to currently running flows, we only want the new leader node to handle scheduling responsibilities from that point forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-05T20:39:36Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T07:38:28Z","closed_at":"2021-08-10T01:00:21Z","merged_at":"2021-08-10T01:00:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a4cda47aaf954041c82e43b6a10f389d1e4a4db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3353/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3353/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3353/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3cfb459d94319cac85d7a4a1bd959a491868d6d1","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:ensure-leadership-change-no-remove","ref":"ensure-leadership-change-no-remove","sha":"3cfb459d94319cac85d7a4a1bd959a491868d6d1","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1505\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFrom a user/platform perspective, we want to see how many workunits are being created for each flow. The metric of workunit count will be emitted in the form <flowgroup>.<flowname>.workunits. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested with flows launched on gaas to see log statement \"Reporting metrics for host: {}, app: {} to Ingraphs with reporting interval of {} seconds.\" \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-04T22:56:42Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T00:33:44Z","closed_at":"2021-08-26T00:14:00Z","merged_at":"2021-08-26T00:14:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b36f27a29600ecb8f11657f2160357fe56dc8e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a14fdb2a8081b89346cb3cdac2947fc15d5aa747","head":{"label":"umustafi:emitWorkUnitCountMetrics","ref":"emitWorkUnitCountMetrics","sha":"a14fdb2a8081b89346cb3cdac2947fc15d5aa747","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1503\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nIf mysql db enters read-only mode due to a failover, the connections need to be reset before writes will work. Currently the validation query is \"select 1\", so it will not evict connections in read-only mode. This new query is taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39552146/evicting-connections-to-a-read-only-node-in-a-cluster-from-the-connection-pool, and should fail the validation if the db is read-only, so connections will be retried.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTested that query succeeded on a non-read only mysql db.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

All these changes in `TableMetadata` object. \r\n- Adding documentation for places where commit does happen or doesn't happen for reasons. \r\n- Remove some of the `IOException` in the method signature wherever they are not required. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nThis PR doesn't add or delete any of the functionality so pass all unit tests should be sufficient. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1500\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nPreviously we always check with one default yarn client, but if the cluster is enabled with Robin and can connect to different RM, it will ends up we cannot find existing application and submit duplicate tasks. So now we need to check against different potential yarn cluster, and also make sure when submitting yarn application, we only have one RM token.\r\n\r\nOptions\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest start a new application can work, test reconnect can work \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1495\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen the application tries to fetch Hadoop tokens for a cluster with no remote namenodes, the current implementation of the getHadoopTokens method doesn't check for the property \"other_namenodes\" while getting remoteFSURIList. This property is not mandatory and won't be present if there are not remote namenodes. In such cases, it throws NPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested by releasing snapshot version locally, application succeeded successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-27T05:11:42Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T17:33:23Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T17:33:22Z","merged_at":"2021-07-28T17:33:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"e9b7eac6d468592b7cb6f0b3ea27a88ba7763ab7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3341/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3341/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3341/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f9d67688e969bf3250e2de040ca5ed0fb41dd342","head":{"label":"dushyantk1509:GOBBLIN-1495","ref":"GOBBLIN-1495","sha":"f9d67688e969bf3250e2de040ca5ed0fb41dd342","user":{"login":"dushyantk1509","id":17546055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTQ2MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17546055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509","html_url":"https://github.com/dushyantk1509","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":372405325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzI0MDUzMjU=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"dushyantk1509/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dushyantk1509","id":17546055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTQ2MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17546055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509","html_url":"https://github.com/dushyantk1509","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dushyantk1509/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dushyantk1509/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1497\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nFlowSpecs contain both configs and property fields that duplicate the same key/value information, however there are slight differences with properties being mutable, configs being type-safe, and legacy code being compatible with properties but not configs.\r\n\r\nAs such, FlowSpec creation and configToProperties are memory expensive operations at scale, and we should aim to minimize them as much as possible.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-26T23:38:28Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T07:38:23Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T22:32:08Z","merged_at":"2021-07-28T22:32:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"13676140d07d2b633b20cca5d207396a7c671a40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3340/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3340/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3340/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/63b4bbbb67c07a5ece2827441ffcaaf7d3beb5fa","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:optimize-config-properties","ref":"optimize-config-properties","sha":"63b4bbbb67c07a5ece2827441ffcaaf7d3beb5fa","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1496\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGaaS has many scenarios with sparse/empty maps and lists. When initializing new data structures, we should initialize them to a certain size if we know the elements beforehand.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-26T22:05:36Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T07:38:22Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T20:02:46Z","merged_at":"2021-07-28T20:02:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a9e239ec7c1c870916d2ceec442a537275c1166","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3339/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3339/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3339/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/c250c3fa7724d6707919339f00e9012962d2ce8b","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:optimize-config-map-memory","ref":"optimize-config-map-memory","sha":"c250c3fa7724d6707919339f00e9012962d2ce8b","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1494\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nHiveSourceTest returns 2 watermarks for testGetWorkunitsAfterWatermark instead of 1.\r\nThis is due to System.getCurrentTime.millis() returning a different value when comparing against the filesystem last updated filetime. To guard against this, change the test to incorporate the workunit within the watermark by assigning it an earlier creation time, thus implying that the file was modified so it needs to be ingested again.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-23T00:37:46Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T07:38:22Z","closed_at":"2021-07-23T00:57:22Z","merged_at":"2021-07-23T00:57:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"48af4c61c4780740b63931901c756e5a184e763b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3338/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3338/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3338/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/30bb9589e5aff2d38f9c27f4a491fb5f5818cfac","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-hive-source-test","ref":"fix-hive-source-test","sha":"30bb9589e5aff2d38f9c27f4a491fb5f5818cfac","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1493\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nProgress reporting for a data copy will provide users with quantitative feedback on the progress of a data copy job as a percentage as well as an estimate of the time remaining for completion. This will update the existing job status endpoint to include the progress percentage and estimate of time left. \r\n\r\nThis PR decorates each work unit with its size in bytes and uses that information to determine the progress of a copy while individual tasks are completed. It emits GobblinTrackingEvents containing the progress as a percentage intermittently and calculates the remaining time for the copy, storing both in the job status. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-22T00:09:39Z","updated_at":"2021-08-02T15:38:15Z","closed_at":"2021-08-02T15:38:15Z","merged_at":"2021-08-02T15:38:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ab79b0453e71eb170b0e75f41daeb10377e7233","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3336/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3336/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3336/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/1986f85373ef5d82d457b3e11474aea4fe59e37e","head":{"label":"umustafi:progressProtoType","ref":"progressProtoType","sha":"1986f85373ef5d82d457b3e11474aea4fe59e37e","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1492\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n- Use String.intern() on FlowSpec keys so that duplicate strings are not created. Duplicate keys in configToProperties can lead about to high heap usage (5% of Gobblin as a Service)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-21T23:04:52Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T07:38:27Z","closed_at":"2022-05-04T07:38:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29a5be2452278d1ac49993eb9d44e783bad37160","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3335/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3335/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3335/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7cd8eb655ece24d68dda180db143de8ab6716e62","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:optimize-flowspec-keys","ref":"optimize-flowspec-keys","sha":"7cd8eb655ece24d68dda180db143de8ab6716e62","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1491\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently, D2 servers are started on all hosts at the time of service start. This change will allow using D2 delayed start, then marking up/down the servers when a host becomes the master/slave respectively. This means only the master will be announced to D2, so all requests will be routed to it.\r\n\r\nThe logic for markup is linkedin specific so must be implemented in internal code.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-16T00:07:55Z","updated_at":"2021-07-23T03:44:58Z","closed_at":"2021-07-23T03:44:58Z","merged_at":"2021-07-23T03:44:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"c65e5d05f24eb2f7f643c67abbdf0171939072bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3333/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3333/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3333/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b98d23fc65de360f761cdc02822a8654cc49ff46","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:d2-delay","ref":"d2-delay","sha":"b98d23fc65de360f761cdc02822a8654cc49ff46","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1490\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn some use case, we may run data pipeline on different clusters but those clusters share the same file system. And in those case, we will want the metadata pipeline to be able to consume all the records even they are running on different clusters. Also make the cluster name for GMCE be configurable so that we don't need to change the accepted cluster names when cluster name itself changes \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-15T01:22:20Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T22:38:59Z","closed_at":"2021-07-19T22:38:59Z","merged_at":"2021-07-19T22:38:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"08db23e15ab73654142998ecabb01bbb51f42a61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d018a058f7e849e16ae6e678f96e3bcf547fdf8f","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1490","ref":"GOBBLIN-1490","sha":"d018a058f7e849e16ae6e678f96e3bcf547fdf8f","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1484\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nSometime we need the avro schema in place even for ORC tables, we have that information in ingestion job but not for compaction job. And it's hard to get the avro schema from orc file itself, so we want to support schema source db, so that we can fetch the schema from source db where ingestion job registers to.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-14T00:28:36Z","updated_at":"2021-07-15T18:46:57Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T18:46:57Z","merged_at":"2021-07-15T18:46:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"e5b6461ecfa5422bdbc309293e753932af7cd5dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3329/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3329/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3329/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f0754b1cb8f9926b6d349622a7780a6a87fe3755","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1484","ref":"GOBBLIN-1484","sha":"f0754b1cb8f9926b6d349622a7780a6a87fe3755","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

1.9 upgrade HI: https://jira01.corp.linkedin.com:8443/browse/DEPEND-15444\r\nAvro upgrade wiki: https://iwww.corp.linkedin.com/wiki/cf/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=ENGS&title=Avro+Initiative+2021\r\nHighlights from Avro 1.9 upgrade: https://godatadriven.com/blog/highlights-from-the-new-apache-avro-1-9-0-release/\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the high level changes in Avro 1.9 (based on above highlight and initial investigation)\r\n1. Deprecation of Joda time librarty and usage of Java 8 library.\r\n2. Move from Jackson 1.x to 2.9. As part of this Jackson classes are removed from the public API. All the public method dealing with older version of Jackson are removed. \r\n   Below are some of methods no longer available\r\n   - getJsonProps of Scheam, Schema.Field is no longer public.\r\n   - getJsonProp of Schema, Scheam.Field is no longer available\r\n3. Changes related to Schema.Field default value. The \"defaultValue\" method of Schema.field is no longer available and is replaced by \"defaultVal\" method. Also observed that some of the generated schemas missing \"default\":null. As a result corresponding tests are failing.\r\n4. Avro 1.9 is leaner now and all avro shaded google guava libararies are removed.\r\n5. There are bunch of tests failing. Some of the tests are fixed and for some TODO list is added in the test itself.\r\n6. There are still lot more unidentified failed tests.\r\n7. To fix some of the tests is required to fix some of the existing Gobblin classes.\r\n8. Some of the tests are failing due to Helix, Hadoop, Hive libraries are using older Jackson version. Added jackson 1.x dependency as required by helix-core and hive-serde library.\r\n9. Some of the tests are failing due to handling of NULL values in the schema.\r\n10. This is a bigger and breaking change and more analysis and discussion is required.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1482\r\n    - \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe issue is caused by the `./gradlew assemble` step conflicting with the build step and not including all the classes needed for some of the build tasks, if it’s done before the build step.\r\n\r\n`./gradlew assemble` is still needed to verify the dependencies, as `./gradlew build` caches the dependencies between runs as an optimization\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1481\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n  When generating workunits, there are scenarios where the underlying file system can throw errors when attempting to collect files to allocate them into workunits. The behavior for single threaded workunit generation is to throw the error, so we should make the multithreaded configuration also throw errors and fail loudly instead of logging and marking the job as successful (although there would still be 0 workunits).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1478\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n`failedDagIds` is a `synchronizedSet`, but as per [the doc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#synchronizedSet(java.util.Set)), it is still not thread safe to iterate over it which the retention thread does, so we saw concurrent modification exceptions related to this. This PR fixes it by creating a copy set and iterating that instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-21T23:52:44Z","updated_at":"2021-06-23T20:48:11Z","closed_at":"2021-06-23T20:48:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a2d863bd7881ab8ab96af5213357ba1eafccdf4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/027e639c857dfeca4d259a9479e0b18b61237ebd","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:failed-dag-id-fix","ref":"failed-dag-id-fix","sha":"027e639c857dfeca4d259a9479e0b18b61237ebd","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n@jack-moseley @Will-Lo please review\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1475\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen a lower order event (orchestrated) having higher count of `currentAttempts` (1) arrives later than a higher order event (flow running) having smaller count of `currentAttempt` (0) , we store 0 as a new `currentAttempt`. This is wrong, because we should take a max of currentAttempt and not blindly give precedence of all the higher order event's properties\r\nover the lower order event's properties\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded a couple of tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-15T01:23:13Z","updated_at":"2021-08-11T17:40:16Z","closed_at":"2021-08-11T17:40:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"345c3433868432de706faa674f767d6b379b77c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3314/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3314/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3314/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8f14a25307491d35370914ad1031f105a00fdba6","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:fixCurrentAttemptMerge","ref":"fixCurrentAttemptMerge","sha":"8f14a25307491d35370914ad1031f105a00fdba6","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1473\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nPrevously, `ConcurrentModificationException` could happen when switching from active to inactive in the scheduler, because specs were removed from `scheduledFlowSpecs` while iterating through it. This fixes it in this scenario by not removing during iteration and just clearing the map at the end (since every entry should get removed anyway).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-14T23:43:33Z","updated_at":"2021-07-01T19:20:36Z","closed_at":"2021-07-01T19:20:36Z","merged_at":"2021-07-01T19:20:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ec59fadead493bd31f5d185a18ce3f8cd5f6cf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ff5f814c3c1141ba61052a888d8720c9dc9f040a","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:leadership-fix","ref":"leadership-fix","sha":"ff5f814c3c1141ba61052a888d8720c9dc9f040a","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1470\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, quiet topics which see no data during a flush interval will not commit watermark to state store. This can result in quiet topics not having any prior stats resulting in an excess number of workunits for such topics. The correct behavior should be to have watermarks with produce rates set to 0.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-12T01:06:39Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T17:50:37Z","closed_at":"2021-06-14T17:50:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"377c194e2329ebb47d24742c6fb45686bb3a05bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3310/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3310/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3310/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/876d3f953e428f1da3aff10c3b51220f5086edc1","head":{"label":"sv2000:quietTopicWatermark","ref":"quietTopicWatermark","sha":"876d3f953e428f1da3aff10c3b51220f5086edc1","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1469\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe have noticed two instances where the streaming topics were having Missing/Orphan hive partition issues. After investigating, it's because the schema.literal is missing when creating the table, and thus the following partition registration in ingestion job are all fail which cause the hourly partition missing. So create this ticket to make it able to proceed hive registration even if schema.literal is missing.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-10T23:47:27Z","updated_at":"2021-06-15T17:14:10Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T17:14:10Z","merged_at":"2021-06-15T17:14:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"0931e14d2ab3a77f26205556d249e3bf2319b1f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3309/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3309/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3309/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/675de73a73f63145b008a5ad2a628976b7852d4b","head":{"label":"ZihanLi58:GOBBLIN-1469","ref":"GOBBLIN-1469","sha":"675de73a73f63145b008a5ad2a628976b7852d4b","user":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176390947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYzOTA5NDc=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZihanLi58","id":48699939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Njk5OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48699939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihanLi58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZihanLi58/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1466\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nEach of the `DagManagerThread`s had its own meter (but with the same names) previously, which causing confusing results when reading them, instead there should only be meters shared across the threads.\r\n\r\n- For service level meter, created one meter in the `DagManager` and passed it to each thread instead\r\n- For group level meters, created a static map keyed by group name to be shared by all threads\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested locally by printing meter values in each thread\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-09T21:52:00Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T00:47:05Z","closed_at":"2021-06-11T00:47:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a5c935edbc1290d03bf27a968941314e000926c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/65e973a543ee01059c654f4b70548f18f1941dbe","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:shared-meters","ref":"shared-meters","sha":"65e973a543ee01059c654f4b70548f18f1941dbe","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

OrcValueWriter\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1465\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe GobblinOrcWriter uses the GenericRecordToOrcValueWriter and takes in input records as GenericRecords. There may be use cases where the input type is not an Avro GenericRecord, so refactor the code to support extending the writer to support other input types. The bulk of the code in the original GobblinOrcWriter is moved to GobblinBaseOrcWriter.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThere is an existing GobblinOrcWriterTest test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-09T21:26:27Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T23:26:46Z","closed_at":"2021-06-11T23:26:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"929d4f8b1383ff160bdadbae18c1f7dbbbb506b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/05de7d5b00537018ea0d9ee4fca661093242ed33","head":{"label":"htran1:orc_struct_writer","ref":"orc_struct_writer","sha":"05de7d5b00537018ea0d9ee4fca661093242ed33","user":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73107999,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzEwNzk5OQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"htran1/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/htran1/gobblin","description":"Universal

In practice, this constraint may be violated particularly when loading system properties which are outside application's control. To ensure these properties are safely handled, the FsSpecConsumer should use the proertiesToConfig() method in PropertiesUtils which adds a suffix to the root properties.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nModified unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1458\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nPreviously the way to manually trigger an execution of a scheduled flow is to send a partial update that sets the flow's `runImmediately` property to true. This PR improves the API by adding a restli action that sends the same partial update. With this, flows can be triggered through the URL: `/flowconfigsV2/(flowGroup:test1,flowName:test1)?action=trigger`\r\n\r\nAlso copied the implementation of `partialUpdateFlowConfig` to `FlowConfigV2ResourceLocalHandler` for testing convenience (normally when running the service `GobblinServiceFlowConfigResourceHandler` would be used, but for tests it is `FlowConfigV2ResourceLocalHandler`).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated unit test and tested in local gaas\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-04T00:12:27Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T14:06:12Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T19:35:13Z","merged_at":"2021-07-15T19:35:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"77c2b95b2a106e83011eade119f88e900a07fa11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3297/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3297/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3297/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/fda8cc6a5ddaa0b8df3ad6f276c1678f7eedc8ea","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:trigger-flow","ref":"trigger-flow","sha":"fda8cc6a5ddaa0b8df3ad6f276c1678f7eedc8ea","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal
