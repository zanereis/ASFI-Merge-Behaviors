processor has experienced a lot of organic growth over the years and had gotten into a state where it became a bit hard to understand.  E.g. method `set_files` did not have a name that clearly indicated its purpose. And that's probably in part because it did a bunch of things and was called in a bunch of places.  I simplify that method and focus on just one aspect of its prior work, namely handling removed files, and call it `handle_removed_files`.\r\n\r\nA lot of the behavior was driven by a data structure on the instance called file paths.  This contained all known files.  It's one thing that was modified in `set_files`.  From looking at the main loop it was not obvious where this structure was being used or modified.  So I made it a local variable instead of instance attr. And now we can easily see all the methods that are using it because it must be passed around.\r\n\r\nI rename the `file_paths` to known_files because that is clearer about its meaning.  Previously it was file_paths and file_queue -- harder to understand the different purposes.  I make file_paths a dictionary because then it's easier to replace all the files in the bundle, something that was previously done by iterating through the files. \r\n\r\nIn prepare file paths, I pull out the mtime mode logic into its own method because it's quite involved and made the prepare file paths method too big and complicated.  Along with this I simplify the logic to not exclude recently processed files if they were recently changed.\r\n\r\nIn some of the tests, I had to change the way we simulated mtime numbers because the input is now a set which does not guarantee order.  So I encode the mtime in the filename in the test.  And the one test dealing with zip file, this was apparently a flakey test.  I change it so we don't mock anything but just copy the file to a tmp dir and make a bundle there, then remove it and see what happens.\r\n\r\nIn clear_orphaned_import_errors I no longer pass the entire list of known dag files.  Cus there could be a lot of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2025-02-04T22:24:10Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T19:18:31Z","closed_at":"2025-02-07T19:18:29Z","merged_at":"2025-02-07T19:18:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"d52cb341444f0b62752a2d5404f375dbc73f2792","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full

message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a PEP 249-like cursor (e.g. ElasticsearchSQLCursor) so the ElasticsearchSQLHook (which is a specialization of the DbApiHook) can be used through the SQLExecuteQueryOperator.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the TestElasticsearchSQLHook mocks the cursor and thus gives the impression the ESConnection has a cursor available which is internally used by the run method of the DbApiHook but in reality doesn't exist, this means at runtime the SQLExecuteQueryOperator will fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above

#46358 moved docker to another mounted directory - but this directory and all files in it are owned by host user. The directory and all files inside should be owned by root in order to properly reflect permissions of the files when building docker images.\r\n\r\nThe change is now simplified. Rather than passing mount directory by variable and passing it through GitHub Actions, we hard-code the location of docker in cleanup_docker.sh script - we also incorporate changing ownership and showing disk space in the same cleanup_docker.sh script and make sure that script is only called in the \"real\" (not composite) actions at the beginning - right after the repository is checked out - previously that script was also called in composite actions and changing the repo to be writeable was done AFTER cleanup_docker.sh - which would not work as we want the /mnt directory to be still owned by the host user, but the docker storage should be still owned by root.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/46393\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/ff7e70056e5b4e6e61d20215eec00054415d4a77, I had realised that there is an issue in the way tuples were handled and I had made a change for that:\r\n\r\n\r\nTo quote from that commit:\r\n- Handling special case of `tuples` - they are json serialisable but we used to store them as lists when passed as tuples, because of usage of json.dumps(). It has been made like this now:\r\n```\r\n    def is_jsonable(x):\r\n        try:\r\n            json.dumps(x)\r\n            if isinstance(x, tuple):\r\n                # Tuple is converted to list in json.dumps\r\n                # so while it is jsonable, it changes the type which might be a surprise\r\n                # for the user, so instead we return False here -- which will convert it to string\r\n                return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nHistorically, all tuples in RTIF were converted to lists and this PR is bringing back that behaviour. It is just more natural to do that. So no major impact to anyone who is using it, if its a pure tuple, it will be kept as a tuple, if nested, it will be list-ified.\r\n\r\n## Testing Results\r\n1. Simple DAG:\r\n```\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom time import sleep\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.providers.standard.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\nfrom airflow.exceptions import AirflowTaskTimeout\r\n\r\n\r\ndef print_hello(*args):\r\n    print(args)\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"atul_rendered\",\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    tags=[\"demo\"],\r\n) as dag:\r\n    PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"matts_assert\",\r\n        python_callable=print_hello,\r\n        op_args=[(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")]\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5fb470d-599b-4f90-9956-d46c09f5d2cb)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

explained in the [lazy consensus thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/lpvq3lhjd79q097f1wy3r3n1jybo2v09), we need to create a new base class `BaseEventTrigger`. This new base class allows categorizing triggers suitable for event driven scheduling usage. Not all triggers should be used to schedule DAGs, `BaseEventTrigger` is making this categorization.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

When set to 0, worker refresh is disabled. When nonzero, Airflow periodically refreshes webserver workers by bringing up new ones and killing old ones.\"\r\n\r\nThe change aims to eliminate ambiguity by clarifying that Gunicorn reload and webserver refresh refer to the same underlying mechanism. Previously, these terms could be misinterpreted as distinct functions or mistaken for auto_refresh_interval, leading to confusion. By emphasizing that both phenomena are part of Gunicorn's worker management strategy, users will have a clearer understanding of how Airflow manages webserver workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep

changes here:\r\n\r\n* mount cache is stored in /mnt directory - separately from the root directory where docker storage is\r\n\r\n* disk stats are displayed more often to see how much disk is used

is failing e.g. in https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/13101805105/job/36550974189 as runners are \"out of disk space\".\r\nThis seems to be caused as only 23GB are free on /root disk where main artifacts like docker is produced. When the runner starts the following disk space is available:\r\n```\r\nRun df -H\r\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\r\n/dev/root        78G   56G   23G  72% /\r\ntmpfs           8.4G  177k  8.4G   1% /dev/shm\r\ntmpfs           3.4G  1.2M  3.4G   1% /run\r\ntmpfs           5.3M     0  5.3M   0% /run/lock\r\n/dev/sda15      110M  6.4M  104M   6% /boot/efi\r\n/dev/sdb1        79G  4.3G   71G   6% /mnt\r\ntmpfs           1.7G   13k  1.7G   1% /run/user/1001\r\n```\r\n(A lot of build tools are already on CI image - see more debug info from the additional debug steps in https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/13102704519/job/36552932758 where the disk space onthe image is allocated.)\r\n\r\n...but this means that after building the image only ~5GB are free and in some corner cases (e.g. main) the build fails. Disk space at then of building pipelines is:\r\n```\r\nRun df -H\r\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\r\n/dev/root        78G   73G  5.2G  94% /\r\ntmpfs           8.4G  177k  8.4G   1% /dev/shm\r\ntmpfs           3.4G  1.2M  3.4G   1% /run\r\ntmpfs           5.3M     0  5.3M   0% /run/lock\r\n/dev/sdb15      110M  6.4M  104M   6% /boot/efi\r\n/dev/sda1        79G  8.2G   67G  11% /mnt\r\ntmpfs           1.7G   13k  1.7G   1% /run/user/1001\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and as it seems a LOT of disk space is on the second drive in /mnt and the larged data chunk from triaging is the docker workspace, this PR adds a bind mout to use the second drive in /var/lib/docker. With this at the end of the build of the image the following free space is available:\r\n```\r\nRun df -H\r\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\r\n/dev/root        78G   54G   25G  69% /\r\ntmpfs           8.4G  177k  8.4G   1% /dev/shm\r\ntmpfs           3.4G  1.2M  3.4G   1% /run\r\ntmpfs           5.3M     0  5.3M   0% /run/lock\r\n/dev/sda15      110M  6.4M  104M   6%

pipelines.\r\n(Numbers were taken from Python

is needed so that we can have the scheduler create the expand TIs for the downstream tasks.\r\n\r\nNote, that we don't enforce that this is set when it needs to be on the server side, as the only way for us to know if we need to or not (and conversely, when it's set when it _doesn't_ need to, which is no effect other than creating a small DB row that nothing will ever read) as doing that would involve loading the serialized DAG to walk the structure which is a relatively expensive operation.\r\n\r\nWe could improve that by \"pre-computing\" some of the info on what tasks are actually mapped or not before serialization so we wouldn't have to walk the task groups to find out, but that wouldn't do anything about the need to load the serialized DAG which is the expensive part.\r\n\r\nIf this turns out to be a problem to not be enforcing this  is passed when required we can revisit the decision later.\r\n\r\nRelates to
