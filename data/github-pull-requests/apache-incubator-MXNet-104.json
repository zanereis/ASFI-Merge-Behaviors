experimentation.\n","created_at":"2016-04-06T12:11:56Z","updated_at":"2017-01-21T00:18:25Z","closed_at":"2017-01-21T00:18:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84a55d9a6b7494b47c36aa69881a98228915089b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1798/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1798/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1798/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/649ee0b73ad33514407a7f7db311053788f99e74","head":{"label":"YafahEdelman:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"649ee0b73ad33514407a7f7db311053788f99e74","user":{"login":"YafahEdelman","id":5892627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTI2Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5892627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman","html_url":"https://github.com/YafahEdelman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":55602419,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTYwMjQxOQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"YafahEdelman/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"YafahEdelman","id":5892627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTI2Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5892627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman","html_url":"https://github.com/YafahEdelman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YafahEdelman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/YafahEdelman/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

is a work-in-progress attempt to refactor the current high-level model API. Because the refactoring is major, to avoid breaking existing code, I started a different set of API. The main component is `Module`, which looks very similar to Torch's modules. We will have both intermediate-level API like `forward`, `backward` on modules, as well as high-level API like `fit`, `score`. The end goal is to allow the modules to be easily composed with high-level imperative API.\n\nTODOs:\n- [x] intermediate-level API `forward`, `backward`, `update`, etc.\n- [x] high-level API `fit`, `predict`, `score`\n- [x] running example, MNIST & CIFAR-10\n- [x] `BucketingModule` and ptb example\n- [x] model saving and loading\n- [ ] ~~`SequentialModule`: a container that connect multiple `Module`s sequentially~~\n  - will come in another PR\n- [x] comments and

mirroring feature?\n- Some operators (e.g. `BatchNorm`) will crash when mirroring is turned on, with some error like `src/symbol/graph_executor.cc:606: Check failed: (info.type) != (kNotInitialized)`.\n- The memory consumption is a bit mysterious to measure, for the cifar10 example. Although I'm only using pycuda to query the total gpu free memory, which is a very rough estimation, I could see that running the exactly same network training (without touching any mirroring option) could actually lead to quite different reporting of memory consumption.\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T19:07:02Z","updated_at":"2016-03-25T15:07:21Z","closed_at":"2016-03-25T15:07:21Z","merged_at":"2016-03-25T15:07:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"18d189898b73872235fac7359775b6d96d84d71d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/8278a1407e21cf51e8a350684732c64d33cb67e2","head":{"label":"pluskid:master","ref":"master","sha":"8278a1407e21cf51e8a350684732c64d33cb67e2","user":{"login":"pluskid","id":3542,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3542?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid","html_url":"https://github.com/pluskid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pluskid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6545537167083860e74bd5cc1401b6dbb9b40bd2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/722 \nThe gradient of the embedding need to be summed and previous way of summing so many timestamps was not very efficient. \n- This PR gives a experimental hack to do smarter memory allocation, and use a stream line addition sequence to calculate the gradient\n- This can benefit the  RNN with long sequences.\n- However, the new optimization relies on the operators to correctly implement AddTo, some of the operators so far are not well tested on AddTo setting, so it is only enabled for summing a lot of gradients.\n\nThe environment variable `MXNET_EXEC_INPLACE_GRAD_SUM_CAP` (default to 8) is introduced to control between whether use the new optimization.\n","created_at":"2016-03-22T05:10:42Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T15:48:59Z","closed_at":"2016-03-22T15:48:59Z","merged_at":"2016-03-22T15:48:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"540d0f50cf5523f55da22759cad17c66617d10a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1697/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1697/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1697/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/8f297879a6224fdb51769c1e2ea8618519ef4d60","head":{"label":"tqchen:master","ref":"master","sha":"8f297879a6224fdb51769c1e2ea8618519ef4d60","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42364986,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjM2NDk4Ng==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"tqchen/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/mxnet","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxnet/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/mxn

@tqchen suggested, an immutable api for FeedForward would be more natural for Scala users. While I reviewed the Feedforward.create in python again, I found it contains too many arguments, which may hard to use: We need to deal with many default values (java even doesn't support default argument) and some arguments may have different types (e.g., the kvstore).\n\nInspired by deeplearning4j, I think it might be more convenient for users to have the builder&set api, e.g., the piece of codes at the bottom of http://deeplearning4j.org/visualization. This is what I did in this PR.\n\nTrust me, java developers will like this kind of api, because they always use IDE and really enjoy that, they type '.set' then everything pop up.\n\nAnd I simply move FeedForward class to a single file because Model.scala grows too long.\n","created_at":"2016-03-09T16:26:03Z","updated_at":"2016-03-10T02:45:38Z","closed_at":"2016-03-10T02:45:38Z","merged_at":"2016-03-10T02:45:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"6270d2ff7740e59de906226d55ba28a7cfe9edf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1607/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1607/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1607/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/db208db15f899ffb648a2d55675b6957e1582b9e","head":{"label":"yzhliu:scala-package-l","ref":"scala-package-l","sha":"db208db15f899ffb648a2d55675b6957e1582b9e","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47767518,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Nzc2NzUxOA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"yzhliu/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

everybody,\n\nI'm really glad to call for a PR request for `mxnet/scala-package`. It brings MXNet to JVM ecosystem.\nPlease refer to [here](https://github.com/javelinjs/mxnet/blob/scala-package-l/scala-package/README.md) to checkout the build & usage document.\n\nWith this package, I look forward to further integrate MXNet with some platforms in Hadoop ecosystems, e.g., Spark and Flink.\n\nHere are the MNIST training results ran on EC2 g2.8xlarge instance with scala-package:\n\n| Model | Devices | KVStore | Epochs | Train Acc | Test Acc | Avg samples/sec |\n| --- | :-- | :-: | --: | --: | --: | --: |\n| MLP | 1 cpu | local | 10 | 0.9906 | 0.9740 | 7419.98 |\n| MLP | 1 gpu | local | 10 | 0.9925 | 0.9770 | 18572.5 |\n| Lenet | 1 cpu | local | 3 | 0.9916 | 0.9870 | 717.38 |\n| Lenet | 1 gpu | local | 3 | 0.9912 | 0.9867 | 1457.29 |\n| Lenet | 4 cpus | local | 10 | 0.9997 | 0.9920 | 1338.4 |\n| Lenet | 4 gpus | local | 10 | 0.9998 | 0.9909 | 7882.14 |\n| Lenet | 4 gpus | local_allreduce | 10 | 0.9998 | 0.9914 | 13696 |\n\nThe Scala Package was first initialized at my own [repo](https://github.com/javelinjs/mxnet-scala). Then @terrytangyuan (Yuan Tang) helped to move it as a part of MXNet main repo. @yanqingmen (Zixuan Huang) joined us after a discussion [here](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/842). We received great help from @tqchen during the development. Thank you all.\n\nHere's a list of contributions each one made:\n- Yizhi: Developed and tested most of the modules. Integrated everything to work.\n- Yuan: Helped to setup travis and contributed to parts of Adam.scala, EvalMetric.scala, Initializer.scala, LRScheduler.scala and some functions in NDArray.scala.\n- Zixuan: Developed the IO module and tested on mnist and cifar dataset.\n\nI highly suggest to grant Zixuan as committer of MXNet as well. The IO module is a core module,\nand we couldn't have moved on without his work. Besides, this module requires some design efforts. His contribution should be as important as Yuan's.\n\nFinally, I opened an [issue](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/1591) for Scala Package TODO list. Any suggestions for this PR or the todo list would be highly appreciated. Thank you!\n","created_at":"2016-03-06T15:00:53Z","updated_at":"2016-03-06T16:36:35Z","closed_at":"2016-03-06T16:36:35Z","merged_at":"2016-03-06T16:36:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ed4eba4a1abaa8223ab1c7c1f3d0cfa8abb5803","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1592/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1592/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1592/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/9965357ea9f6a6bed20baf7f088bcebb55ad9846","head":{"label":"yzhliu:scala-package-l","ref":"scala-package-l","sha":"9965357ea9f6a6bed20baf7f088bcebb55ad9846","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47767518,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Nzc2NzUxOA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"yzhliu/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

to https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues/1323\n@thirdwing @Puriney \nAnother minor issue is with clip_gradient when ctx in the model is different than mx.ctx.default. This results in an error of the type \"Check failed: lhs.ctx() == rhs.ctx() operands context mismatch\"\"\nIt is due to the redefinition of the grad as an mx.nd.array after the clip:\ngrad <- mx.nd.array(grad)\nthis uses the default ctx that can be different to the one used in the model. Setting in your code the default ctx to the same used in the model solves the problem but I don't think this should be a feature.\nChanging the nd.array re-definition of grad in optimizer.R to:\ngrad <- mx.nd.array(grad,ctx(weight))\nseems to solve the issue. I don't know if it is possible to avoid doing the conversion of grad back and forth to array and nd.array. \nI've done a PR with this

error:**\n\nIf eval_metric='mse', there will be a error message like:\n\n```\nValueError: Shape of labels (128, 1) does not match shape of predictions (128, 10)\n```\n\nThe reason is that the following lines in `metric.py` for MAE, MSE, RMSE fucntions:\n\n```\ncheck_label_shapes(label, pred, shape=1)\n```\n\nforce label and pred have exactly the same shapes. While in this case, label is (128,1), pred is (128,10), it is broadcastable. Hence these checks should be removed.\n\nWhether two ndarray's are broadcastable can be automatically checked by numpy, hence we do not need to add extra codes.\n\nPS: This pull request also allows directly use eval_metrix=mx.metric.Accuracy() for model.fit().\n\n**MAE, MSE, RMSE are not calculated correctly:**\n\nThe loss scales should not change with different batch sizes. The original implementation is not calculated correctly. The losses are increasing as the batch sizes decrease! And this bug has been fixed.\n","created_at":"2016-03-05T13:31:20Z","updated_at":"2016-03-09T18:04:59Z","closed_at":"2016-03-09T18:04:59Z","merged_at":"2016-03-09T18:04:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6bcf4d5ef965021fc27d44dee95a5bcc4ef5079","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1582/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/1582/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/1582/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/e4c8e29ed4fd8450cc32754dfb3d6c9503a09057","head":{"label":"taoari:fix-metric-error","ref":"fix-metric-error","sha":"e4c8e29ed4fd8450cc32754dfb3d6c9503a09057","user":{"login":"taoari","id":3815006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTUwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3815006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari","html_url":"https://github.com/taoari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53015030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzAxNTAzMA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"taoari/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"taoari","id":3815006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTUwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3815006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari","html_url":"https://github.com/taoari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taoari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/taoari/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
