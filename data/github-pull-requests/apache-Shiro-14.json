href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.1.5</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.1.x releases. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.</p>\n<p>==== 5.1.5 ====</p>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a memory leak due to incomplete clean-up of backup replica sync operations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22767\">#22767</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where <code>NullPointerException</code> was thrown around the <code>CREATE JOB</code> statement which is using Kafka Sink connector when Kafka has no records yet. Now, it produces an appropriate log message. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22697\">#22697</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the map entries recovered from persistence were not expiring after their time-to-live durations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22558\">#22558</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where replication over WAN was failing on the source cluster members, when there are multiple batch publishers configured in a single WAN replication. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22500\">#22500</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== 5.1.4 ====</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the <code>hazelcast-jet-cdc-mysql</code> module from the Hazelcast Platform Enterprise distributions due to licensing.\nYou need to manually download this module if you have the Enterprise edition. See Capture Changes from MySQL for details. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5312\">#5312</a></li>\n<li>The Kubernetes discovery plugin has been enhanced to support the service token expiration. The token is time-bound and its content\nis refreshed periodically in the recent Kubernetes versions. A new token reader has been implemented to get the token value periodically. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22394\">#22394</a></li>\n<li>You can now provide comma-separated lists to give multiple labels for the Kubernetes Discovery Plugin configurations <code>service-label-name</code>, <code>service-label-value</code>, <code>pod-label-name</code>, and <code>pod-label-value</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22401\">#22401</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== 5.1.3 ====</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved connection handling. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21641\">#21641</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>When the <code>hazelcast.socket.buffer.direct</code> property is enabled, clusters no longer throw exceptions in response to text protocols such as the REST API. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21700\">#21700</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== 5.1.2 ====</p>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a cluster could not be formed when security is enabled, various client permissions are set, and multiple members\nare started simultaneously. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21510\">#21510</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a cluster was unresponsive when you perform a health check to see the members are in the safe state;\ncluster members were hanging in the <code>REPLICA_NOT_SYNC</code> state during such health checks. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21208\">#21208</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the list of members in the cluster was reset to an empty list when the UUID of a cluster changes after its restart:\nthis was causing startup failures since Hazelcast could not manage the events due to the empty member list after a restart. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21178\">#21178</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the statistics like puts and removals were not increasing when these operations are executed through Transactional interface. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21107\">#21107</a></li>\n<li>Fixed a data race in <code>SingleProtocolEncoder</code>; while one method of this interface is called from the input thread,\nanother one is called from the output thread which was causing the race. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20994\">#20994</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the automatic module name in <code>hazelcast-5.x.jar</code> could not be detected using Gradle. The reason was\n<code>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> not being the first or second entry in the JAR file; now this manifest file is the second entry. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20976\">#20976</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== 5.1.1 ====</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

content**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/lprimak/shiro/blob/jakartaee-integration/support/jakarta-ee/README.adoc\r\n\r\n**Integrates Shiro functionality into Jakarta EE Web / Full Profile**\r\n\r\nNotes for reviewers:\r\nThis is an integration module with the full Jakarta EE web profile.\r\nThe purpose of this module is for the consumer to integrate with Jakarta EE Web Profile to the fullest extent possible.\r\nAs an integration module, it pulls in the pieces necessary to develop a complete application.\r\nIt is not the intent of this module to be minimalistic. Core Shiro packages already serve that purpose well.\r\nThis module incorporates features of the whole Web Profile..\r\nI thought long and hard which dependencies to pull in, and I think I have achieved good balance between minimal necessary, quality of the resulting code, and ease of maintenance.\r\n\r\nI would like for the reviewers to look for the following:\r\n- Bugs (of course)\r\n- Code style compatibility with Shiro and Apache (the code has been checkstyle'd so there should be no issues)\r\n- Any glaring features that are missing\r\n- Any overall issues with compatibility how Shiro and Apache does things\r\n- Things that are not 'basic' (the code is 10+ years old, the basics should be covered pretty well)\r\n\r\nWhat I think is out of scope for this review:\r\n- Rearchitecting the project, unless there is something truly catastrophic I missed (I do not have the time, and I will likely withdraw the PR)\r\n- Reducing / Increasing scope and intent (again, for the same reason as above)\r\n- Dependencies can be discussed off-line, as those are always a sticking point, and a point of preference, but I would prefer to leave things as they are (again, there only so much time I can devote to such non-zero-risk endeavor)\r\n\r\nSee [README](https://github.com/lprimak/shiro/blob/jakartaee-integration/support/jakarta-ee/README.adoc) for the documentation on feature set.\r\n\r\nThank you very much and I appreciate all the feedback\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nFor Security Vulnerabilities, please email: security@shiro.apache.org\r\nFor more details on how to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

the parent to v28 so we do not need to merge all the plugin updates manually.\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

to report a vulnerablity see: https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

causing issues with Jakarta EE 10 in native session tests\r\n\r\nThis change was necessary for compatibility for both Servlet 3.x and 5.x+\r\nSince deprecated interface `HttpSessionContext` was removed in Servlet 5.x, the shim needs to be back in place\r\nfor the same code to compile and run on both servlet versions in the shaded Jakarta artifacts.\r\n\r\nTests that failed will be introduced

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n```\r\n----- Root Cause

href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.2.1</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.2.x releases. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>==== Hazelcast Platform 5.2.1 ====</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the support of discovering ECS and EC2 members on AWS. See Deploying a Cluster on Amazon AWS. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22590\">#22590</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a memory leak due to incomplete clean-up of backup replica sync operations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22756\">#22756</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a map was loading old values with <code>map.set()</code> when map store offloading is enabled. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22603\">#22603</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the map entries recovered from persistence were not expiring after their time-to-live durations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22557\">#22557</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where external data store configurations could not be added dynamically. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22464\">#22464</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== Hazelcast Platform 5.2.0 ====</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>SQL stream-to-stream joins: You can now correlate multiple streams of data with each other using the relational join operation.</li>\n<li>Generic MapStore (BETA): You no longer need to write Java code to get data from an external data store, such as a relational database, into Hazelcast by implementing the\n<code>MapStore</code> or <code>MapLoader</code> interfaces.</li>\n<li>JDBC connector (BETA): You can now use SQL to connect to and query any database that supports the JDBC interface.</li>\n<li>CP Subsystem Leadership Priority: To ensure the availability of the CP subsystem, you can now transfer CP member leadership to another member:\nThere are cases when some CP members should not act as a leader. For example, a member with high load would not be a good leader, or, in a WAN deployment, members in a primary datacenter may be preferred in order to minimize the latency between the clients and leader. You can transfer the leadership using the <code>cp-member-priority</code> configuration element. See Configuring Leadership Priority.</li>\n<li>User Defined Types (Experimental): You can now query nested objects within Java, compact, and portable mappings using the User Defined Types (UDTs).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced a check to control the versions of Hazelcast Platform members and Hazelcast CLI are matched. Previously, it was possible to submit a job using a different version of CLI from the member version. Generally, it would work when there were no change in the serialized form of pipeline. Now, Hazelcast fails earlier in this case. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22224\">#22224</a></li>\n<li>Removed the <code>BETA</code> annotations from the compact serialization and <code>GenericRecord</code> related classes, i.e., they are stable. Now, compact serialization is enabled by default; the <code>enabled</code> attribute within the <code>compact-serialization</code> configuration block does not exist anymore. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21997\">#21997</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>MapStore Offloading: Added <code>offload</code> element to map store configuration. It is used to offload map store and loader operations for each map in the cluster. This way, a map store operation does not block the next operations by blocking a partition thread indefinitely. Partition threads are one of the most important shared resources in a cluster; this offloading enables faster completion of the operations in these threads.\nSee Offloading MapStore and MapLoader Operations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21651\">#21651</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SQL Engine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple performance enhancements in the SQL engine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Distribution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed <code>hazelcast-hibernate53</code> dependency from the main Hazelcast Platform distribution as it is not needed anymore. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22282\">#22282</a></li>\n<li>Minor versions of Hazelcast Platform are now released as X.Y.0, instead of the previous X.Y versioning scheme. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22218\">#22218</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Serialization</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/210\">#210</a> Improve error messages when Groovy classes can't be located (avoiding the <code>NullPointerException</code>s that

href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.2.1</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.2.x releases. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>==== Hazelcast Platform 5.2.1 ====</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the support of discovering ECS and EC2 members on AWS. See Deploying a Cluster on Amazon AWS. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22590\">#22590</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a memory leak due to incomplete clean-up of backup replica sync operations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22756\">#22756</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a map was loading old values with <code>map.set()</code> when map store offloading is enabled. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22603\">#22603</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the map entries recovered from persistence were not expiring after their time-to-live durations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22557\">#22557</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where external data store configurations could not be added dynamically. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22464\">#22464</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>==== Hazelcast Platform 5.2.0 ====</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>SQL stream-to-stream joins: You can now correlate multiple streams of data with each other using the relational join operation.</li>\n<li>Generic MapStore (BETA): You no longer need to write Java code to get data from an external data store, such as a relational database, into Hazelcast by implementing the\n<code>MapStore</code> or <code>MapLoader</code> interfaces.</li>\n<li>JDBC connector (BETA): You can now use SQL to connect to and query any database that supports the JDBC interface.</li>\n<li>CP Subsystem Leadership Priority: To ensure the availability of the CP subsystem, you can now transfer CP member leadership to another member:\nThere are cases when some CP members should not act as a leader. For example, a member with high load would not be a good leader, or, in a WAN deployment, members in a primary datacenter may be preferred in order to minimize the latency between the clients and leader. You can transfer the leadership using the <code>cp-member-priority</code> configuration element. See Configuring Leadership Priority.</li>\n<li>User Defined Types (Experimental): You can now query nested objects within Java, compact, and portable mappings using the User Defined Types (UDTs).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced a check to control the versions of Hazelcast Platform members and Hazelcast CLI are matched. Previously, it was possible to submit a job using a different version of CLI from the member version. Generally, it would work when there were no change in the serialized form of pipeline. Now, Hazelcast fails earlier in this case. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22224\">#22224</a></li>\n<li>Removed the <code>BETA</code> annotations from the compact serialization and <code>GenericRecord</code> related classes, i.e., they are stable. Now, compact serialization is enabled by default; the <code>enabled</code> attribute within the <code>compact-serialization</code> configuration block does not exist anymore. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21997\">#21997</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>MapStore Offloading: Added <code>offload</code> element to map store configuration. It is used to offload map store and loader operations for each map in the cluster. This way, a map store operation does not block the next operations by blocking a partition thread indefinitely. Partition threads are one of the most important shared resources in a cluster; this offloading enables faster completion of the operations in these threads.\nSee Offloading MapStore and MapLoader Operations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21651\">#21651</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SQL Engine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple performance enhancements in the SQL engine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Distribution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed <code>hazelcast-hibernate53</code> dependency from the main Hazelcast Platform distribution as it is not needed anymore. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22282\">#22282</a></li>\n<li>Minor versions of Hazelcast Platform are now released as X.Y.0, instead of the previous X.Y versioning scheme. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22218\">#22218</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Serialization</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers

new ShiroFilterConfiguration class exposed through the WebEnvironment This class allows for confiuration of the Shiro filter through various config mechanisms (Ini, Guice, Spring, etc) This makes it

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

SHIRO-896\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-896) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In

is a forward-port of https://github.com/apache/shiro/pull/499 to main\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn 1.10.0, an NPE can be thrown because DefaultWebEnvironment has no default value for ShiroFilterConfiguration. This commit adds a default value determined by WebEnvironment.getShiroFilterConfiguration().\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [X] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [X] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-26T19:15:16Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T18:17:27Z","closed_at":"2022-11-16T18:17:23Z","merged_at":"2022-11-16T18:17:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"2bcdc1e5cd276ba5c5322a18c38df393f896ee90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/515/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/515/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/515/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/statuses/85ce71217b294991df5d82d5676e3707037fdf20","head":{"label":"apache:SHIRO-893_main_npe_filter_init","ref":"SHIRO-893_main_npe_filter_init","sha":"85ce71217b294991df5d82d5676e3707037fdf20","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":291570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTE1NzA=","name":"shiro","full_name":"apache/shiro","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro","description":"Apache

[hazelcast](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast) from 3.12.13 to 5.2.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/releases\">hazelcast's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.2.0</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for <strong>Hazelcast Platform v5.2.0</strong> release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues and pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SQL stream-to-stream joins:</strong> You can now correlate multiple streams of data with each other using the relational join operation.</li>\n<li><strong>Generic MapStore (BETA):</strong> You no longer need to write Java code to get data from an external data store, such as a relational database, into Hazelcast by implementing the\n<code>MapStore</code> or <code>MapLoader</code> interfaces.</li>\n<li><strong>JDBC connector (BETA):</strong> You can now use SQL to connect to and query any database that supports the JDBC interface.</li>\n<li><strong>CP Subsystem Leadership Priority:</strong> To ensure the availability of the CP subsystem, you can now transfer CP member leadership to another member:\nThere are cases when some CP members should not act as a leader. For example, a member with high load would not be a good leader, or, in a WAN deployment, members in a primary datacenter may be preferred in order to minimize the latency between the clients and leader. You can transfer the leadership using the <code>cp-member-priority</code> configuration element. See Configuring Leadership Priority.</li>\n<li><strong>User Defined Types (Experimental):</strong> You can now query nested objects within Java, compact, and portable mappings using the User Defined Types (UDTs).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced a check to control the versions of Hazelcast Platform members and Hazelcast CLI are matched. Previously, it was possible to submit a job using a different version of CLI from the member version. Generally, it would work when there were no change in the serialized form of pipeline. Now, Hazelcast fails earlier in this case. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22224\">#22224</a></li>\n<li>Removed the <code>BETA</code> annotations from the compact serialization and <code>GenericRecord</code> related classes, i.e., they are stable. Now, compact serialization is enabled by default; the <code>enabled</code> attribute within the <code>compact-serialization</code> configuration block does not exist anymore. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21997\">#21997</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<h3>Performance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MapStore Offloading:</strong> Added <code>offload</code> element to map store configuration. It is used to offload map store and loader operations for each map in the cluster. This way, a map store operation does not block the next operations by blocking a partition thread indefinitely. Partition threads are one of the most important shared resources in a cluster; this offloading enables faster completion of the operations in these threads.\nSee Offloading MapStore and MapLoader Operations. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21651\">#21651</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SQL Engine</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple performance enhancements in the SQL engine.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Distribution</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed <code>hazelcast-hibernate53</code> dependency from the main Hazelcast Platform distribution as it is not needed anymore. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22282\">#22282</a></li>\n<li>Minor versions of Hazelcast Platform are now released as X.Y.0, instead of the previous X.Y versioning scheme. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22218\">#22218</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Serialization</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added support of <code>List</code>, <code>ArrayList</code>, <code>Set</code>, <code>HashSet</code>, <code>Map</code>, and <code>HashMap</code> for the zero-config serializers. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21980\">#21980</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a check to the array of <code>Compact</code> and <code>GenericRecord</code> object fields, that does not allow different item types and schemas in such fields. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21958\">#21958</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moved the <code>GenericRecord</code> and <code>GenericRecordBuilder</code> interfaces to the new <code>serialization.genericrecord</code> package. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21955\">#21955</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In case there is a field type that is not supported by the reflective serializer, now Hazelcast fails with an exception; all JDK classes are now excluded from the zero-config serialization, meaning, they cannot be used as types, field types, or array component types in the reflective serializers. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21918\">#21918</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hazelcast now does not provide methods to read a default value in case of a missing field in the data. Instead, the following method has been introduced in <code>CompactReader</code> to check the existence of a field with its name and kind.+</p>\n<p>FieldKind getFieldKind(String fieldName);</p>\n<p>You can use this method for fields that have changed or have a potential to change in the future. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21876\">#21876</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Moved the <code>type-name</code> and <code>class</code> configuration elements into the <code>compact-serialization</code> block. Removed the <code>registered-classes</code> element. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21861\">#21861</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Renamed the <code>cloneWithBuilder()</code> method as <code>newBuilderWithClone()</code> in the <code>GenericRecord</code> class. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21730\">#21730</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for <code>char</code> fields in the compact serialization format. With this, <code>char</code>, <code>char[]</code>, <code>Character</code>, and <code>Character[]</code> fields are now supported in the reflective compact serializers. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21054\">#21054</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

is based on #506, so that should get merged first. \r\nThe additional commit will pull in changes from main (`--add-opens` and `--illegal-access`) where appropriate.\r\nThis commit will also change the github CI to use Java 17.\r\nMac will build on 8 and 17 only to save resources.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-895) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-894) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/210\">#210</a> Improve error messages when Groovy classes can't be located (avoiding the <code>NullPointerException</code>s that

caused an exception to be thrown for Groovy 4.0.0-RC-1 and newer when binding properties in a script/console/shell and <code>bindPropertiesToSeparateVariables</code> is false.

removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.1.4 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.</p>\n<p>== Enhancements</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the <code>hazelcast-jet-cdc-mysql</code> module from the Hazelcast Platform Enterprise distributions due to licensing.\nYou need to manually download this module if you have the Enterprise edition. See xref:pipelines:cdc.adoc#step-4-start-hazelcast[Capture Changes from MySQL] for details. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5312\">#5312</a></li>\n<li>The Kubernetes discovery plugin has been enhanced to support the service token expiration. The token is time-bound and its content\nis refreshed periodically in the recent Kubernetes versions. A new token reader has been implemented to get the token value periodically. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22394\">#22394</a></li>\n<li>You can now provide comma-separated lists to give multiple labels for the Kubernetes Discovery Plugin configurations <code>service-label-name</code>, <code>service-label-value</code>, <code>pod-label-name</code>, and <code>pod-label-value</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22401\">#22401</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v5.1.3</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features,\nenhancements, fixed issues, and removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.1.3 release.\nThe numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.</p>\n<p>==== 5.1.3 Release Notes ====</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enhancements</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved connection handling. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/21641%5B#21641%5D(https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21641)\">hazelcast/hazelcast#21641</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Fixes</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>When the <code>hazelcast.socket.buffer.direct</code> property is enabled, clusters no longer throw exceptions in response to text protocols such as the REST API.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/21700%5B#21700%5D(https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21700)\">hazelcast/hazelcast#21700</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v5.1.2</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast 5.1.2 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.</p>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a cluster could not be formed when security is enabled, various client permissions are set, and multiple members\nare started simultaneously. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21510\">#21510</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where a cluster was unresponsive when you perform a health check to see the members are in the safe state;\ncluster members were hanging in the <code>REPLICA_NOT_SYNC</code> state during such health checks. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21208\">#21208</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the list of members in the cluster was reset to an empty list when the UUID of a cluster changes after its restart:\nthis was causing startup failures since Hazelcast could not manage the events due to the empty member list after a restart. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21178\">#21178</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the statistics like puts and removals were not increasing when these operations are executed through Transactional interface. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21107\">#21107</a></li>\n<li>Fixed a data race in <code>SingleProtocolEncoder</code>; while one method of this interface is called from the input thread,\nanother one is called from the output thread which was causing the race. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20994\">#20994</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the automatic module name in <code>hazelcast-5.x.jar</code> could not be detected using Gradle. The reason was\n<code>/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> not being the first or second entry in the JAR file; now this manifest file is the second entry. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20976\">#20976</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v5.1.1</h2>\n<p>This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast Platform 5.1.1 release.

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/210\">#210</a> Improve error messages when Groovy classes can't be located (avoiding the <code>NullPointerException</code>s that

caused an exception to be thrown for Groovy 4.0.0-RC-1 and newer when binding properties in a script/console/shell and <code>bindPropertiesToSeparateVariables</code> is false. The error logging when this happens has been improved.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/223\">#223</a> Support <code>5</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>8</code>, and <code>1.9</code> arguments to <code>targetBytecode</code> so that validation doesn't unexpectedly fail since it uses the <code>maven.compiler.target</code> property and these arguments are valid for javac.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Potentially breaking changes</h2>\n<p>This release requires Java 8 and drops support for Java 7.
