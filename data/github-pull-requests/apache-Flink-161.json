you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

table statement in blink planner\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis patch add support for end-to-end computed column for create table statement in table-planner-blink. Note that we does not support referencing UDFs from external catalog now for this path, it is expected to implement in FLINK-14664.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Define a new interface named `FlinkToRelContext` used to hold the variables for converting schema table to a relational expression\r\n  - Make `FlinkPlannerImpl` extend `FlinkToRelContext`, the `FlinkPlannerImpl` is used to convert table and expanding view now. Instead of hold a `ViewExpander` instance, `FlinkPlannerImpl` itself is a `ViewExpander` now\r\n  - Define a new interface named `CalciteCatalogTable`, which is the type that we fetch table from the catalog. We then translate it lazy in `FlinkRelOptTable` to `TableSourceTable` or `TableSinkTable`\r\n  - In `FlinkRelOptTable#toRel`, add logic to append computed columns to the table\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nSee tests in `CatalogTableITCase` and `ComputedColumnToRelTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWith [FLINK-14502](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14502) we changed how log property files are being discovered by the `YarnClusterDescriptor` and this resulted in Yarn tests not writing their job manager log files anymore. This made debugging a lot harder and next to impossible. \r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this by introducing and exposing the utility method `Configuration setLogConfigFileInConfig(...)` in the `FlinkYarnSessionCli` which is responsible for discovering the log config file. This method is now used directly by the tests to simulate what the CLI does based on user-provided input.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRunning a test like the `YarnITCase` and seeing the log files being created in the `target` dir is sufficient to verify the validity of the change.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\nCurrently, Flink client (PackagedProgram) does not respect the classloading policy and uses hardcoded parent-first classloader, while the other components like jobmanager and taskmanager use child-first classloader by default and respect the classloading options. This makes the client more likely to have dependency conflicts, especially after we removed the convenient hadoop binaries (so users need to add hadoop classpath in the client classpath).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add configuration to PackagedProgram construtors.*\r\n  - *Determind PackagedProgram classloader with respect to classloader resolve-order and parent-first pattern in the configuration.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Add tests in ClassLoaderITCase to check classloading orders in PackagedProgram execution.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPrevent triggering new checkpoints after the coordinator has been stopped.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we only check whether the coordinator has been stopped, but only check in actual triggering checkpoint, in this pr we want to fix this.\r\n\r\nThe event order will lead to this problem is \r\n- triggerCheckpoint  eager pre-checks\r\n- job cancel\r\n- triggerCheckpoint actual trigger checkpoint\r\n\r\nall the three steps are guarded by lock, will release the lock after step 1 and require the lock in step 3.\r\n\r\nwe checked whether the coordinator has been stopped in eager pre-checks, but not in actual trigger checkpoint.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add a check whether the coordinator has been stopped when actual trigger checkpoint*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added test to verify this change in

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe’ve designed a new Java e2e test framework so that we can integrate more external system , such as run test on distributed flink cluster, on distributed Kafka cluster.  we accomplish the features in this Pull request: \r\n1. Abstract the Flink resources, and provide standalone implementation .so that the test can run on different flink env. The distributed implementation have not been provided now, would better be another PR if neccesary.\r\n2. Abstract the Kafka resources,  and provide a standalone implementation.\r\n3. Provide the annotations to separate  all the e2e tests, now we provide TravisGroup1~TravisGroup6 level, each level means the nightly tests management in .travis.yaml file. \r\n4. Provide a file cache to avoid the duplicated packages downloading ( which may timeout the test ).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 2b17535918  Provide a JobSubmission class which wrap the ./bin/flink command, so that we can submit flink job by flink shell in java.\r\n- d2f308efaa   Introduce the flink resource.\r\n- a486e00b20 download cache. \r\n- 4c8586d55c Introduce the Kafka resource and kafka tests. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn verify \\\r\n-pl org.apache.flink:flink-end-to-end-tests-common-kafka  \\\r\n-DdistDir=/Users/openinx/software/flink/build-target \\\r\n-DincludeE2E=org.apache.flink.tests.util.categories.TravisGroup1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSince [FLINK-14080](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14080) introduced an internal representation(SqlTimestamp) of TimestampType with precision. This subtask will replace current long with SqlTimestamp, and let blink planner support precision of TimestampType.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- Tables defined by DDL is not supported in this PR since de/serializing DataTypes lost precision information. Would open another ticket to cover.\r\n- Built-in time functions/operators which use long to compute is not supported in this PR too. Would open another ticket to cover.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- The first commit([ee687db](https://github.com/docete/flink/commit/ee687db5db6e142fd241a54210ff45ac684b0008)) introduces setTimestamp/getTimestamp interface to TypeGetterSetters/VectorizedColumnBatch and writeTimestamp interface to BinaryWriter\r\n- [be1beee](https://github.com/docete/flink/commit/be1beeeaa37a5110d070bd15bd9909634a03d680) to [0b57ee3](https://github.com/docete/flink/commit/0b57ee3bb06ec2efbddaeb2ef511764ad307f722) replace current long with SqlTimestamp, and Fix all existing failure cases\r\n- [915064c](https://github.com/docete/flink/commit/915064cc3b1f1d506d4099d4ec1772289637c031) introduces LegacyTimestampTypeInfo and LegacyLocalDateTimeTypeInfo to represent Types.SQL_TIMESTAMP and Types.LOCAL_DATE_TIME with precision\r\n- [3d1de92](https://github.com/docete/flink/commit/3d1de92308358bfc6ff7dbee8b28121322315909) supports precision of Timestamp type in table source\r\n- [8751385](https://github.com/docete/flink/commit/87513858c338ecdf27542eae79c8941ef0a1fcd5) supports precision of Timestamp type for timestamp literals\r\n- [90f3316](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/10105/commits/90f33163f65cb8eb0a81470a9c543315801401e5) Make the  default precision of Timestamp type as 6\r\n- [b659001](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/10105/commits/b6590011efb64160ee075504742bd279c1723b95) Make the interpreted string of Timestamp type conforms to the definition of timestamp literal which defined in SQL standard\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests and new tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRefactor ScalaShellRemote(Stream)Environment to simplify inheritance\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- ScalaShellRemoteEnvironment directly inherits from

rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes, methods in Environments, I think no one should depend on the methods modified. In another perspective, @Public in class doesn't mean in its methods.)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRefactor ExecutionGraph creation in tests as TestingExecutionGraphBuilder\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce `o.a.f.runtime.executiongraph.TestingExecutionGraphBuilder`, mainly based on `ExecutionGraphUtils.TestingExecutionGraphBuilder`\r\n- Replace `@VisibleForTesting` constructors with `TestingExecutionGraphBuilder` and then remove those constructors\r\n- Replace `ExecutionGraphUtils.TestingExecutionGraphBuilder` constructors with `TestingExecutionGraphBuilder` and then remove it\r\n- Refactor `ExecutionGraphRestartTest` for removing the internal class `TestingExecutionGraphBuilder`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a code refactor without functionality

to inconsistent slot table\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen a slot request is redundantly made with the same AllocationID to a\r\nslot index other than the already allocated one, slot table becomes\r\ninconsistent having two slot indices allocated but one AllocationID\r\nassigned to only the latest slot index. This can lead to slot leakage.\r\nThis patch prevents such redundent slot request from rendering\r\ninconsistent slot allocation state by rejecting the request.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Let `TaskSlotTable.allocateSlot` disallow slot allocation request if a requested allocation ID is already occupied by any slot.\r\n  - Added a unit test to `TaskSlotTableTest`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n - Existing tests should pass.\r\n - A newly added `testRedundantSlotAllocation` is succeeded with the fix.\r\n - Manually verified the change by running a constantly failing app (by throwing exception in UDF to trigger fail-over and swallowing interrupts on source to make cancellation stuck) with 64 parallelism with 8 slots per taskmanager and 600ms heartbeat timeout (100ms heartbeat interval) for both continuous fail-over and heartbeat timeout. Without fix, this stress test hits this bug and then keeps getting slot allocation failure exception. With the fix, it does survive without slot allocation failure for days (with log `Allocation ID {} is already allocated in {}.` printed, indicating it exercised the bug).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis support DDL watermark end-to-end in blink planner. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 0c0342c380002db8e05bb51d2e56af4fcbe5165b: Support referencing function with fully/partially qualified names in SQL\r\n   - this is the same to #10039, you can skip to review this commit.\r\n- 35761fd70e6b2069541273beb62ae1c55e5baddd: Make sure TableSourceTable.catalogTable is not null\r\n- 3e89f491d29a11ba4c4bf25ac372051a5e29d45e: Convert SqlCreateTable with SqlWatermark to CatalogTable\r\n- 8990d4686b38627c99d5cd53f667afea9cdd7de5: Introduce WatermarkGenerator interface to generate watermark from current row\r\n- cdb56e005a9c6bfde47f88f189f806a90ac7457f: Support code generation a WatermarkGenerator from RexNode\r\n  - this introduced `SqlToRexConverter` interface to convert a SQL string to `RexNode`. \r\n- a3db95a7340322421d1fa826dcac850116011687: Support to generate and apply watermark assigner in translateToPlan\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests:\r\n - `SqlToOperationConverterTest#testCreateTableWithWatermark`: makes sure the watermark information is converted into `CatalogTable` from `SqlCreateTable` correctly.\r\n - `WatermarkAssignerOperatorTest#testCustomizedWatermarkGenerator`: makes sure the `WatermarkGenerator` interface works correctly.\r\n - `WatermarkGeneratorCodeGenTest`: makes sure the generated `WatermarkGenerator` is as expected.\r\n - `TableScanTest#testDDLTableScan`: makes sure the watermark information is in the plan in streaming mode, but not in the plan in batch mode. \r\n - `TimeAttributeITCase`: makes sure the DDL watermark works end-to-end. \r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-06T06:33:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:02:44Z","closed_at":"2019-11-08T09:19:46Z","merged_at":"2019-11-08T09:19:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"937356f786b5edac28a7ff44fc31410761c6d7f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10098/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10098/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10098/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ed717ffe4bdbdcd42c88d51cf13b05bcd12f7995","head":{"label":"wuchong:watermark-planner","ref":"watermark-planner","sha":"ed717ffe4bdbdcd42c88d51cf13b05bcd12f7995","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63797485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzc5NzQ4NQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"wuchong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\nCurrently, when the size of ```LocalBufferPool``` is expended by ```LocalBufferPool#setNumBuffers``` and there are segments available in the global ```NetworkBufferPool```, we may failed to notify the potential buffer consumers which are waiting for the ``LocalBufferPool`` to be available. This is a potential regression compared to the previous implementation in which the blocking request thread will wake itself up actively and request available buffers form the global pool.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to fix the regression by notify the potential buffer consumers when the size of ```LocalBufferPool``` is expended.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - The potential buffer consumers are notified when the size of ```LocalBufferPool``` is expended.\r\n  - Test case ```LocalBufferPoolTest#testIsAvailableOrNot``` is enhanced to cover the scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is verified by enhancing the existing test case ```LocalBufferPoolTest#testIsAvailableOrNot```.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-05T16:26:09Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T16:26:36Z","closed_at":"2019-11-05T16:26:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89fb66b5952ee916142bed1b1b84c13d841b104d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10091/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10091/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10091/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cb10f19848b0e96cbd96811d62d4e44e4007d4e3","head":{"label":"double-bin:master","ref":"master","sha":"cb10f19848b0e96cbd96811d62d4e44e4007d4e3","user":{"login":"double-bin","id":33393994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzkzOTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33393994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/double-bin","html_url":"https://github.com/double-bin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/double-bin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/double-bin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/double-bin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/double-bin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/double-bin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/double-bin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/double-bin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/double-bin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/double-bin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ef3dd92c13aeae581d96f814890599bbd54da0a0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- *support cep wait state*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *add cep wait state*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added cep wait tests CEPITCase#testEventTimeWithWait*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n- Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n- The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @Public(Evolving): (no)\r\n- The serializers: (no)\r\n- The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n- Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n- The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-05T09:38:34Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:08:31Z","closed_at":"2019-11-14T14:06:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"279b6fd233a5e76bdb0d64d93e094a930000074b","assignee":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10087/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10087/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10087/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e66b9acc0e1e3adfd16bd0d6f3764e14851d5a38","head":{"label":"limaowei666666:master","ref":"master","sha":"e66b9acc0e1e3adfd16bd0d6f3764e14851d5a38","user":{"login":"limaowei666666","id":20715402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzE1NDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20715402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/limaowei666666","html_url":"https://github.com/limaowei666666","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/limaowei666666/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/limaowei666666/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/limaowei666666/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/limaowei666666/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/limaowei666666/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/limaowei666666/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/limaowei666666/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/limaowei666666/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/limaowei666666/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"28cf30dbadabf829627781dc8aa05fbacb7ffe5a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"nod

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis PR is to fix the issue in [FLINK-14382](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14382). Flink plugin mechanism could not work for yarn cluster. The plugin directory only needs to be shipped and should not be added to classpath.\r\n\r\nAfter [FLINK-14561](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14561), the plugins will be loaded through relative path.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n* Only ship plugin directory on yarn\r\n* Add `AnotherDummyFS` and `WordCount` example to check plugins isolation\r\n* Add e2e test to check plugins isolation for standalone cluster\r\n* Add e2e test to check plugins isolation for yarn cluster\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nE2E tests has been added to check the plugin isolation.\r\n\r\n* `./run-single-test.sh test-scripts/test_plugins_isolation.sh`\r\n* `./run-single-test.sh test-scripts/test_plugins_isolation_yarn.sh`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\nCurrently back-pressure monitor relies on detecting task threads that are stuck in `requestBufferBuilderBlocking`. There are actually two cases to cause back-pressure ATM:\r\n\r\n - There are no available buffers in `LocalBufferPool` and all the given quotas from global pool are also exhausted. Then we need to wait for buffer recycling to `LocalBufferPool`.\r\n - No available buffers in `LocalBufferPool`, but the quota has not been used up. While requesting buffer from global pool, it is blocked because of no available buffers in global pool. Then we need to wait for buffer recycling to global pool.\r\n\r\nWe try to implement the non-blocking network output in FLINK-14396, so the back pressure monitor should be adjusted accordingly after the non-blocking output is used in practice. In this PR, we implement a new back pressure monitor which monitors the task back pressure by checking the availability of ResultPartitionWriter, e.g. if there are available free buffers in the BufferPool of ResultPartitions for output.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - A new back pressure tracker was implemented which monitors the task back pressure by checking the availability of ResultPartitionWriter, e.g. if there are available free buffers in the BufferPool of ResultPartitions for output.\r\n  - The old stack sampling based back pressure tracker implementation and relevant code were removed.\r\n  - New test cases were added to verify the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nSeveral new test cases are added to verify the changes, including ```BackPressureStatsTrackerImplTest```, ```BackPressureSampleCoordinatorTest```, ```TaskBackPressureSampleServiceTest```, ```TaskTest#testNoBackPressureIfTaskNotStarted```, ```TaskExecutorSubmissionTest#testSampleTaskBackPressure```.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the matching logics of ResourceSpec/ResourceProfile/Resource.\r\n\r\nThere are resources of double type values, like cpuCores or all extended resources. These values can be generated via a merge or subtract, so that there can be small deltas.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in resource matching, these resources are matched without considering the deltas, which may result in issues. More details see FLINK-14594.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce a ResourceValue which stores a double value and its acceptable precision (the same kind of resource should use the same precision). It provides compareTo method, in which two ResourceValues are considered equal if the subtracted abs does not exceed the precision. It also provides merge/subtract/validation operations.\r\n- Change Resource to use ResourceValue to store its value.\r\n- Change ResourceSpec to use ResourceValue for cpuCores. \r\n- Replace the usages of equals with another method hasSameResources which considers the precision.\r\n- Change ResourceProfile to use ResourceValue for cpuCores. \r\n- Replace the usages of equals with another method hasSameResources which considers the precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n - *Added tests for ResourceValue/AdditiveResourceValue*\r\n - Changes to ResourceSpec/ResourceProfile are already covered by their existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis pull requests make the `StandaloneJobClusterEntrypoint` use the user code class loader.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - link the `FLINK_JOB_ARTIFACTS_DIR` to the `FLINK_HOME/job` dir\r\n  - `ClassPathJobGraphRetriever` constructs a user code classpath from `FLINK_HOME/job`\r\n  - `ClassPathJobGraphRetriever` sets the user code classpath to `PacakgeProgram`\r\n  - `ClassPathJobGraphRetriever` uses the `packageProgram` to build a jobgraph with the user clode classpath\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - Extended the test that validates`ClassPathJobGraphRetriever` can retrieve a `JobGraph` with correct user classpath\r\n - Extended the test that validates `PackagedProgram` can create a `JobGraph` even if the `jarFile` param of the constructor is null\r\n  - execute the `test_docker_embedded_job.sh` manually to verify the StandaloneJobCluster runs well.\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-04T12:44:27Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:03:29Z","closed_at":"2019-11-09T11:27:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59ff4cbf91be67611d842af3966f902c6e708ef0","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6ec2aaa93f8e87cd1fdb8dcbac4b8ff091514221","head":{"label":"guoweiM:FLINK-14465","ref":"FLINK-14465","sha":"6ec2aaa93f8e87cd1fdb8dcbac4b8ff091514221","user":{"login":"guoweiM","id":26054913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU0OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26054913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM","html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85899056,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTg5OTA1Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"guoweiM/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guoweiM","id":26054913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDU0OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26054913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM","html_url":"https://github.com/guoweiM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoweiM/orgs","repos_url

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn order to fix the issue FLINK-14560\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nConfigurationParserUtils.java : I modify the logical in getManagedMemorySize() to obtain a correct result when TaskManagerOptions.LEGACY_MANAGED_MEMORY_SIZE is set to zero.\r\n\r\nTaskManagerServices.java : I modify the condition in getManagedMemoryFromHeapAndManaged() to calculate the taskmanager.memory.size according to fraction  even when taskmanager.memory.size is set to zero . \r\n\r\nTaskManagerHeapSizeCalculationJavaBashTest.java : Add a scenario with taskmanager.memory.size equal to 0\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\nTaskManagerHeapSizeCalculationJavaBashTest.compareHeapSizeShellScriptWithJava()\r\nNettyShuffleEnvironmentConfigurationTest.calculateHeapSizeMB()\r\nNetworkBufferCalculationTest.calculateNetworkBufFromHeapSize()\r\nYarnConfigurationITCase.testFlinkContainerMemory()\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nBy setting taskmanager.memory.size : 0\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-03T14:29:15Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T15:03:49Z","closed_at":"2019-11-10T10:23:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92b7540ba64cba511b08cf2a17ac9caeb2020937","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10073/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10073/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10073/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6b2834fbd0a5ac6c35a8dbf58f4ff0c3374831b6","head":{"label":"faaronzheng:flink-14560","ref":"flink-14560","sha":"6b2834fbd0a5ac6c35a8dbf58f4ff0c3374831b6","user":{"login":"faaronzheng","id":8400362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDAzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8400362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/faaronzheng","html_url":"https://github.com/faaronzheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faaronzheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faaronzheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faaronzheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faaronzheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faaronzheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faaronzheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faaronzheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faaronzheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faaronzheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"15f8f3c52a1bf11ecf9f550388eee550b7fc763e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis PR fixes a couple of issues related to serialization stack in blink table planner:\r\n* fixes the digest of GenericRelDataType, before the digest did not take into account generic parameters of TypeInformation. Therefore e.g. `ANY(TypeInformation<Map<Integer, String>>)` and `ANY(TypeInformation<Map<Row, Int>>)` were equal.\r\n* fixes the way `NullSerializer`, `NullAwareMapSerializer` and `BinaryGenericSerializer` take snapshots. \r\n* fixes the type of accumulator of `CollectAggFunction`, before the function was using a `GenericTypeInfo` instead of `PojoTypeInfo`\r\n* fixes race conditions when calling `LazyBinaryFormat#materialize`\r\n* fixes `BinaryGenericSerializer#duplicate` method\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo support Hive 1.0.0 and 1.0.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added profiles and shim implementations for these two versions.\r\n  - New shim interfaces are added to create Hive record writer and get schema from deserializer respectively, since the related util classes are incompatible between old and new Hive versions.\r\n  - Misc changes to accommodate the tow versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCovered by existing changes and verified tests pass for all profiles.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? NA\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-31T13:21:30Z","updated_at":"2021-10-14T08:53:51Z","closed_at":"2019-11-01T17:35:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b956eec6a0f84d5d35bdba6b01e631306b29881","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9eacc9cf03c6c85e070c0a51ba207cf86447a588","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-14588","ref":"FLINK-14588","sha":"9eacc9cf03c6c85e070c0a51ba207cf86447a588","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n fix typo in CheckpointCoordinator\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

documented)","created_at":"2019-10-30T14:57:05Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:53:03Z","closed_at":"2019-10-30T15:39:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7d156ee0569896ffe67f59d1e617466260459d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fb0213d9ba5a06c4e69649bbd420995238073bd3","head":{"label":"zzchun:fix-typo-in-CheckpointCoordinator","ref":"fix-typo-in-CheckpointCoordinator","sha":"fb0213d9ba5a06c4e69649bbd420995238073bd3","user":{"login":"zzchun","id":33080263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgwMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33080263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun","html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":118125414,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTgxMjU0MTQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"zzchun/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zzchun","id":33080263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgwMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33080263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun","html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe race condition occurred because `StreamTask#cancel` will stop\r\n`TaskMailboxProcessor#runMainLoop` by sending a poison letter. That loop,\r\nhowever, can also be left by receiving EOI from upstream tasks, such\r\nthat the normal cleanup in `StreamTask#invoke` will close the\r\nmailbox(processor). Sending a (poison) letter with a closed mailbox will\r\ntrigger an `MailboxStateException`, which acts as a safety net and reports\r\nillegal mailbox accesses in respect to its state.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the situation, the enqueuing of the poison letter is more now\r\nrobust. It checks for the mailbox being in the correct state (OPEN) or\r\nelse will not enqueue the poison letter, which would not have an effect\r\nanyways as the mailbox loop has already been terminated.\r\nSince the check and the enqueuing of the letter are non-atomic, another\r\n(much more unlikely) race condition would have been introduced. Hence,\r\nthere is now a convenience method to `TaskMailbox` to run code under the\r\ninternal lock, such that `MailboxProcessor` can atomically check if\r\nmailbox is still open and enqueuing poison letter.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Adds convenience method in `TaskMailbox` to execute code under the internal lock.\r\n - `MailboxProcessor` uses that method to perform an atomic operation that checks for the mailbox state and enqueues poison letter when open.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded 2 unit tests for testing the exclusive lock and the robust stop of the mailbox loop.\r\nThe failing e2e tests the overall interplay.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-30T13:51:58Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:54:40Z","closed_at":"2019-10-31T15:10:08Z","merged_at":"2019-10-31T15:10:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"8522f3b0b93a6ae92f0497888a3200e2db91fd6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10049/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10049/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10049/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/776504c9a21756a5111e60f6574b8f5a17209b6b","head":{"label":"AHeise:FLINK-14544","ref":"FLINK-14544","sha":"776504c9a21756a5111e60f6574b8f5a17209b6b","user":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"63b5c941d795e065fad0d5ad229cf57b7bb25bd4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"htt

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn current region failover when using DefaultScheduler, most of the input result partition states are unknown. Even though the failure cause is a PartitionException, only one unhealthy partition can be identified.\r\n\r\nThe may lead to multiple unsuccessful failovers before all the unhealthy but needed partitions are identified and their producers are involved in the failover as well. (unsuccessful failover here means the recovered tasks get failed again soon due to some missing input partitions.)\r\n\r\nThis PR is to enable failover strategy in DefaultScheduler to leverage JM side tracked partition availability for better failover experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Change FailoverStrategy.Factory#create(FailoverTopology) to FailoverStrategy.Factory#create(FailoverTopology, ResultPartitionAvailabilityChecker).\r\n- Add schedulerBase#getResultPartitionAvailabilityChecker which returns getExecutionGraph().getResultPartitionAvailabilityChecker()\r\n- In DefaultScheduler use the resultPartitionAvailabilityChecker from SchedulerBase to create the failover strategy from the factory\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\nThe PR of FLINK-14440 which is based on this one also proves it works.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRewrite the e2e kafka related test by Java, so that we can move the FLINK-11463 forward.   it need to meet the following requirement: \r\n1. Should abstract the Flink resources, and provide standalone implementation & distribution implementation, so that the test can run on different flink env.\r\n2. Should abstract the Kafka resource,  and provide standalone implementation at least, can leave the distribution impl as dummy because seems we're not depending on it now.\r\n3.  Will provide the file cache later , not in this PR because it's seems big enough now, another PR will be better for reviewing.\r\n4. Set different catalog for each e2e test case, so that we can configure to decide whether to run the given test in diff nightly case ( no need to run most of the e2e test in precommit env). it will be another PR.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 4b43f87c14 Introduce the rough java framework for flink end-to-end testing\r\n- b523eace79 Define the KafkaDistribution and its behavior, so that the upper layer e2e java framework can depends on it.\r\n- 876f0f86b2 Add the kafka streaming end-to-end tests\r\n- 4108e40950 Abstract the KafkaResource so that the e2e test can run on both standalone cluster and distributed cluster, currently the distributed kafka resource is still in TODO state.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn package test \\     \r\n-DdistDir=/Users/openinx/software/flink/build-target \\\r\n-De2e.flink.mode=localStandalone \\\r\n-De2e.kafka.mode=localStandalone \\\r\n-Dtest=TestSQLClientKafka,TestSQLClientKafka010,TestSQLClientKafka011,TestStreamingKafka,TestStreamingKafka010,TestStreamingKafka011  \\\r\n-pl org.apache.flink:flink-end-to-end-tests-common\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis commit reads the FLINK_PLUGINS_DIR env variable directly instead of first\r\nwriting it first to the Flink Configuration and then reading it from there. This\r\nhas the advantage that the plugins env variable which is intended for the local\r\nprocess only is not being leaked to other processes. The latter can happen if\r\nwe start a new Flink process based on the read Flink Configuration (e.g. Yarn,\r\nMesos TaskExecutor).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`MemoryManager` currently manages the memory bookkeeping for all slots/tasks inside one `TaskExecutor`. For better abstraction and isolation of slots, we can shrink its scope and make it per slot. The memory limits are fixed now per slot at the moment of slot creation. All operators, sharing the slot, will get their fixed fractional limits.\r\n\r\nIn future, we might make it possible for operators to over-allocate beyond their fraction limit if there is some available free memory in the slot but it should be possible to reclaim the over-allocated memory at any time if other operator decides to claim its fair share within its limit.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - introduce `TaskSlotTableBuilder` for tests\r\n  - Refactor out slots creation from the `TaskSlotTable` constructor to the factory method in `TaskManagerServices`\r\n  - `TaskSlot` has its own memory manager and `close` method to shutdown the memory manager and release all left unreleased memory (with a warning check whether everything has been already released)\r\n  - When the `TaskSlotTable` is stopped, all slots are closed as well. Currently, it basically happens only if the TM is completely stoped, same as for the former TM's global memory manager\r\n  - Remove the global memory manager from `TaskManagerServices`, keep only memory size\r\n  - Remove now redundant number of slots from the `MemoryManager`.\r\n  - Adjust unit tests\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe non-blocking output was introduced in FLINK-14396 and FLINK-14498 to solve the problem of handling the checkpoint barrier in the case of backpressure.\r\n    \r\nIn order to make the whole process through, `StreamInputProcessor` should be allowed to process input elements if the output is also available.\r\n   \r\nThe default core size of `LocalBufferPool` for `ResultPartition` should also be increased by 1 for two considerations:\r\n\r\n- `StreamTask` can only process input if there is at-least one available buffer on output side, so it might cause stuck problem if the minimum pool size is exactly equal to the number of subpartitions, because every subpartition might maintain a partial unfilled buffer.\r\n\r\n- Increases one more buffer for every output `LocalBufferPool` to void performance regression if processing input is based on at-least one buffer available on output side.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Rename `AvailabilityProvider#isAvailable` as `AvailabilityProvider#getAvailableFuture`*\r\n  - *Refactor `ResultPartitionWriter` interface to abstract class*\r\n  - *Refactor `AvailabilityProvider` to provide default `#isAvailable` and `#isVolatileAvailable` methods*\r\n  - *Adjust `StreamTask` stack to consider output status while `processInput`\r\n  - *Increase one more minimum size for output `LocalBufferPool`*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSome new unit tests would be added later after confirming the core process make sense.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / `no`)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / `no`)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / `no` / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / `no` / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / `no` / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / `no` / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / `no`)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (`not applicable` / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)","created_at":"2019-10-29T09:49:23Z","updated_at":"2020-02-10T10:36:33Z","closed_at":"2019-11-17T05:47:18Z","merged_at":"2019-11-17T05:47:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"2c8b4ef572f05bf4740b7e204af1e5e709cd945c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10029/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10029/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10029/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7fb32f8c87ed066de3ec574d0537f4b00ae25780","head":{"label":"zhijiangW:FLINK-14553","ref":"FLINK-14553","sha":"7fb32f8c87ed066de3ec574d0537f4b00ae25780","user":{"login":"zhijiangW","id":12387855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg3ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12387855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW","html_url":"https://github.com/zhijiangW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60976697,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDk3NjY5Nw==","name":"flink","full_name":"zhijiangW/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhijiangW","id":12387855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg3ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12387855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW","html_url":"https://github.com/zhijiangW","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhijiangW/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhijiangW/flink","description":"Mirror

Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request makes exception message  more clear by using logicalType's toString() function rather than the name of conversionClass.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *update file org.apache.flink.table.planner.sinks.TableSinkUtils.scala*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-29T09:41:07Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T14:56:49Z","closed_at":"2019-11-04T04:31:42Z","merged_at":"2019-11-04T04:31:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"a96b3dadb38a1b24d18efbcd6a6e5879121555f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/10027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/10027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/45ddcc3eb65176473f85c64910deaf7ed6516d90","head":{"label":"leonardBang:FLINK-14549","ref":"FLINK-14549","sha":"45ddcc3eb65176473f85c64910deaf7ed6516d90","user":{"login":"leonardBang","id":5163645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjM2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5163645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang","html_url":"https://github.com/leonardBang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64203606,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDIwMzYwNg==","name":"flink","full_name":"leonardBang/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leonardBang","id":5163645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjM2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5163645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang","html_url":"https://github.com/leonardBang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leonardBang/flink","description":"Mirror
