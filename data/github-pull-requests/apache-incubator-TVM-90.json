RFC: https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-a-general-task-extraction-mechanism-for-auto-scheduler/8444 for details.\r\n\r\n## Change highlight:\r\n\r\n- auto_scheduler enabling.\r\n    - Implicitly enable when calling `auto_scheduler.extract_tasks`.\r\n    - Explicitly enable using `PassContext(config={\"relay.backend.use_auto_schedule\": True})` when compilation.\r\n    - Remove `auto_scheduler.enable_relay_integration`.\r\n- Task extraction.\r\n    - Add a flag `include_simple_task=False`. When setting it to `True`, the tasks with only injective ops will be extracted as well.\r\n    - Extract tasks with Relay op strategy, but only rely on the TOPI computes and ignore the TOPI schedules, meaning that the selection of TOPI compute is purely based on `plevel`.\r\n    - Skip the compute with unsupported ops (e.g., `extern`, `hybrid` ops).\r\n- Schedule querying.\r\n    - Change `auto_scheduler.FallbackContext.silent` to `verbose`. It can be 0 (silent), 1 (only warn the missing configs for workload with complex ops, default), and 2 (warn all missing configs).\r\n\r\nThis PR is ready for review. cc @merrymercy @tqchen @zhiics @jcf94 @icemelon9.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- [x] Collect feedback from RFC.\r\n- [x] Avoid collecting tasks with only simple ops per users' choice.\r\n- [x]  Deal with fallback schedules for non-collected tasks on GPU.\r\n- [x] Add unit tests.\r\n- [x] Specify the use of auto_scheduler in PassContext.\r\n- [x] Surpass the fallback warnings for simple tasks.","created_at":"2020-11-12T01:51:34Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T04:10:53Z","closed_at":"2020-11-17T04:10:20Z","merged_at":"2020-11-17T04:10:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e8de2c527db270e8e6208c7cf09f00de9491bf56","assignee":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"icemelon","id":2696494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTY0OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2696494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon","html_url":"https://github.com/icemelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icemelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

work is based on @jainris initial PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/6523\r\n\r\nI added a relay.qnn.conv2d_transpose node. The strategy I followed is to\r\nconvert to int16 and invoke nn.conv2d_transpose (which already exists in\r\nrelay). Main changes:\r\n\r\n- The node declaration lives in relay/qnn/op/convolution_transpose.cc\r\n- Cast int8->int16 and subsequent offset removal is in tvm/relay/qnn/op/legalizations.py.\r\n- I added and tested the operator in the tflite front-end\r\n- I added a unit-test in Relay for qnn.conv2d_transpose\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-11T11:52:13Z","updated_at":"2020-11-26T16:00:22Z","closed_at":"2020-11-26T16:00:05Z","merged_at":"2020-11-26T16:00:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"093629c1e5651f526b3c8a2ae353f25050a89418","assignee":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

PR enables the TRT BYOC integration to be used with target=\"llvm\" (previously could only use \"cuda\").\r\nIf an input or output DLTensor is not located on the GPU, we will now allocate a GPU buffer to pass to TensorRT and transfer the data from the DLTensor accordingly. Since data_entry_ is needed during BuildEngine now, we had to move BuildEngine from JsonRuntime::Init to first run.\r\n\r\nThis is prerequisite to use TRT BYOC in combination with Relay VM which in

PR adds ONNX support for NonMaxSuppression.\r\n\r\nThe ONNX API is a little odd, it roughly follows the TF op for combined_non_max_suppression. To implement it in tvm, I decided to go with relay while loops instead of writing a new TOPI kernel.\r\n\r\nGetting it to work on CUDA was a pain, first, I needed to change a couple of input values from attributes to parameters, then the cuda kernels were out of spec and skipping tests. Implementing those tests and passing them required refactoring some of the kernels to bring them in spec, and then removing cuda threads in several places to get the CUDA kernel to return the correct results. \r\n\r\nI labeled this WIP because I'd like to spend more time trying to figure out how to speed up the cuda kernels, but I'd love ideas from anyone who's interested in looking at it.\r\n\r\n@jroesch @jwfromm @zhiics @tkonolige @csullivan \r\n\r\nBecause you've touched the cuda nms file, could you take a look @Laurawly @yongwww @kevinthesun

tuning a task with all invective operators on GPU, Ansor inlines all operators for better performance. However, this makes the expression complex and causes high overhead of lowering the TE schedule, which is required for cost model feature extraction. Since the tuning space of these tasks is relatively small, it is sufficient to use random cost model so that we can avoid the lowering overhead.\r\n\r\nHowever, the flow of InitPopulation -> RandomStates only gave me one state. After diving into details, I found that all states generated by initial populations are the same in terms of state.ToStr(). The reasons I can think of are either 2,048 is insufficient to produce two different states, or ToStr() does not reflect different states. Here is an example output of initial population sampling with de-duplication (throw away the states if it is already in the out_states):\r\n\r\n```\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n-------------------------  [ Search ]\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGenerate Sketches               #s: 1\r\nSample Iter: 5  #Pop: 1 #Target: 50     fail_ct: 10239  Time elapsed: 46.81\r\n#Target has been reduced to 25 due to too many failures or duplications\r\nSample Iter: 10 #Pop: 1 #Target: 25     fail_ct: 20479  Time elapsed: 92.52\r\n#Target has been reduced to 12 due to too many failures or duplications\r\nSample Iter: 15 #Pop: 1 #Target: 12     fail_ct: 30719  Time elapsed: 138.50\r\n#Target has been reduced to 6 due to too many failures or duplications\r\nSample Iter: 20 #Pop: 1 #Target: 6      fail_ct: 40959  Time elapsed: 184.33\r\n#Target has been reduced to 3 due to too many failures or duplications\r\nSample Iter: 25 #Pop: 1 #Target: 3      fail_ct: 51199  Time elapsed: 229.81\r\n#Target has been reduced to 1 due to too many failures or duplications\r\nSample Initial Population       #s: 1   fail_ct: 53247  Time elapsed: 239.00\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, even 50K samples cannot even produce the second state. I added a set to check the number of unique states before and after infer bound, and here is the results:\r\n\r\n```\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n-------------------------  [ Search ]\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGenerate Sketches               #s: 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nSample Iter: 5  #Pop: 1 #Target: 25     fail_ct: 10239  Time elapsed: 95.63\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\n#Target has been reduced to 12 due to too many failures or duplications\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nSample Iter: 10 #Pop: 1 #Target: 12     fail_ct: 20479  Time elapsed: 190.91\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\n#Target has been reduced to 6 due to too many failures or duplications\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nSample Iter: 15 #Pop: 1 #Target: 6      fail_ct: 30719  Time elapsed: 285.54\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\n#Target has been reduced to 3 due to too many failures or duplications\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nSample Iter: 20 #Pop: 1 #Target: 3      fail_ct: 40959  Time elapsed: 380.32\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\n#Target has been reduced to 1 due to too many failures or duplications\r\nSample Initial Population       #s: 1   fail_ct: 43007  Time elapsed: 399.26\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 1\r\nGA Iter: 0      Max score: 0.0121       Min score: 0.0121       #Pop: 1 #M+: 0  #M-: 0\r\nUnique before InferBound 1\r\nUnique after InferBound 7\r\nGA Iter: 1      Max score: 0.0121       Min score: 0.0121       #Pop: 7 #M+: 0  #M-: 0\r\nUnique before InferBound 7\r\nUnique after InferBound 12\r\nGA Iter: 2      Max score: 0.0121       Min score: 0.0121       #Pop: 12 #M+: 0  #M-: 0\r\nUnique before InferBound 12\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis log implies two points:\r\n\r\n1. We should call ToStr() after infer bound to make sure we can differentiate states. As we can see from the log, 2,048 candidates have the same ToStr() before infer bound, but we got 7 different ToStr() after infer bound.\r\n\r\n2. Systematically mutate tile sizes is way more efficient than random sampling. As can be seen from the log, we can get 7 different states in only 2,048 mutated states, but we only get 1 state in 43,007 random states.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this PR runs evolutionary search even we are using the random cost model and here is the new log (initial poulation is set to 1 and retry is set to 2):\r\n\r\n```\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n-------------------------  [ Search ]\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGenerate Sketches               #s: 1\r\nSample Initial Population       #s: 1   fail_ct: 2047   Time elapsed: 19.30\r\nGA iteration number has been adjusted to 3 due to random cost model\r\nGA Iter: 0      Max score: 0.3863       Min score: 0.3863       #Pop: 1 #M+: 0  #M-: 0\r\nGA Iter: 3      Max score: 0.9023       Min score: 0.0289       #Pop: 12        #M+: 1422       #M-: 161\r\nEvolutionarySearch              #s: 12  Time elapsed: 31.20\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n-------------------------  [ Measure ]\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGet 12 programs for measure.

first-order AD currently incorrectly deals with functions with tuple arguments, in particular by trying to add tuples when summing the gradients.

This PR lifts addition to work on the tuples (which was already done by the higher-order AD).\r\n\r\nHowever, higher-order AD currently does not support tuples in the top-level function, and I added an xfail test to show this.

recently released version 3.0 (dates can be seen here: https://pypi.org/project/h5py/#history). This breaks TF 2.3 and Keras, as reported already by others, e.g. https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/44467.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, there are a few tests that fail:\r\n```\r\nFAILED

the failures/errors indeed is the same as reported upstream:\r\n```\r\n\r\n    def load_weights_from_hdf5_group(f, layers):\r\n      \"\"\"Implements topological (order-based) weight loading.\r\n

\r\n\r\n * Pin h5py to use the previous major release (2.x) and not new version 3.0, due to incompatibilities with TF and Keras that make TVMC and Frontend tests to fail\r\n\r\n_Note_: just to make it clear, this is caused by the `h5py` release and affects TF >= 2.1.0 so it is *not related* in any way with the recent update to TF 2.3.1.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @u99127 @areusch @ANSHUMAN87

very small PR changes how channels are extracted from a Conv2D relay op when converting to TensorRT. Previously, we relied on the `channels` attribute being available. However, it is optional and often left as `None`. When attempting to convert in this case `stoi` fails with an unpleasant error. Since we are already enforcing that the weight layout is `OIHW`, there is no downside to instead extracting the channel info from the weight shape. I updated the corresponding conv2d test to not specify channels to confirm that this change resolves the issue.","created_at":"2020-10-30T21:47:49Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:57:19Z","closed_at":"2020-10-31T13:21:50Z","merged_at":"2020-10-31T13:21:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"ceef616f2caa9b3189d472f3713e774fdb594db4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/b7c8628c1d959a0141a521fa498bf7d7bf1947b9","head":{"label":"jwfromm:trt_conv_channel_fix","ref":"trt_conv_channel_fix","sha":"b7c8628c1d959a0141a521fa498bf7d7bf1947b9","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

PR adds the m6g instance to the mainline CI which would enable our ARM tests.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I only enabled the tests that are covered by task_python_unittest and the integration tests are disabled because it needs more fixes\r\n\r\nIn addition, while I was testing in the ci_docker_staging branch, go_lang tests fail. Therefore, I disable it for now. A follow up PR with some small fixes to the scripts will be send to enable it after the PR is merged.\r\n\r\nNoting, during test, the doc and frontend CPU tests at the integration stage were failing here (https://ci.tlcpack.ai/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm/detail/ci-docker-staging/32/pipeline/380), but they are not related to arm docker image.\r\n\r\nI will leave more software installation and enabling of ACL tests by ARM folks.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @comaniac @leandron @u99127
