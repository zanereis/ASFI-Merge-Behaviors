when using a file based source implementation to read data from files we have 2 output options: \r\n- read only the content of the each line of each file into a PCollection \r\n- read the content of a file, key each line in the file with the file name and put it into a PCollection (through direct usage of the `ReadAllViaFileBasedSourceWithFilename` PTransform)  \r\n\r\nWhile this cover a large bulk of the desired read operations, we can generalize the current implementation to allow a much larger space of possibilities for the users.\r\n\r\nBy introducing a serializable lambda as a parameter for the `ReadAllViaFileBasedSource` class, and a data carrier adapter class to simplify the makeOutput method arguments with that one of the provided lambda, we can enable users to make new decisions on how to emit the data read from particular files by making more information accessible about those files their data was extracted from. \r\n\r\nThis change adds such generalization to the `ReadAllViaFileBasedSource` class, a new factory method to `TextIO` PTransform (along side documentation on how to use it) and tests that corroborate the changes made.\r\n\r\nSubsequent PRs can be done to propagate the functionality to other file base sources (Avro, Parquet, etc). \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Support embeddings in MLTransform using config based structure. \r\n\r\nEach config will define its own model handler so that model handler can be compatible with the inputs passed to the MLTransform.\r\nThis PR supports `vertex_ai`, `hugging face`(sentence-transformers).\r\n\r\nChanges made:\r\n1. Make `ProcessHandler` a PTransform.\r\n2. Create `_TextEmbeddingHandler` which takes a `ModelHandler` but it is responsible to work on `Dict[str, Any]` inputs.\r\n3. Create a helper class that would create and saves the PTransform list required to process data processing steps or embedding configs. `MLTransform` would be the container that holds the list of transforms and these list of transforms are passed to the `_MLTransformToPTransformMapper` which maps each data processing transforms to its PTransform\r\n      * For example, tft based transforms are mapped to TFTProcessHandler.\r\n      * Embedding configs are mapped to RunInference\r\n4. Use `jsonpickle` to store and load the ptransforms instances. This is done to seal the gap between training and inference. `jsonpickle` is cross compatible across python versions and has backward compatibility with older versions of its versions.\r\n\r\nThis PR will throw if input is a `Dict[str, List[str]]`. Works for `Dict[str, str]`\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
