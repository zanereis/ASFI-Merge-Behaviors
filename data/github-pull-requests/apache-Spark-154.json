As a result, the next time\r\nwhen the analyzer resolves a temp view, the registered function couldn't be found.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```scala\r\nval func =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a small followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34297. There was a mistake during moving file from `python/pyproject.toml` to `dev/pyproject.toml` in `reformat-python` script. We should also fix `reformat-python`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make `reformat-python` script runnable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via running `./dev/reformat-python` script.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: __main__.py [OPTIONS] SRC ...\r\nTry '__main__.py -h' for help.\r\n\r\nError: Invalid value for '--config': File 'python/pyproject.toml' does not exist.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n358 files left

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of persistent view is create hive table with view text.\r\nThe view text is just a query string, so the hackers may tamper with it through various means.\r\nSuch as, `select * from tab1` tampered with `drop table tab1`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFirst, the view text is query string, `parser.parsePlan(viewText)` occurs more overhead than `parser.parseQuery(viewText)`.\r\nSecond, the view text can be tampered by hackers and issue security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'. Unless hackers tamper view text, user will not see any change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-10T08:56:19Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T16:10:12Z","closed_at":"2021-11-15T14:47:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f436193ff70e8a53ec03e963960694fbaa4cb99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34543/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34543/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34543/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f46831ec573ab90b72ffd917a773ebdd840e17f","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-37266","ref":"SPARK-37266","sha":"0f46831ec573ab90b72ffd917a773ebdd840e17f","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake `OptimizeSkewInRebalancePartitions` rule support optimize non-root node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`OptimizeSkewInRebalancePartitions` now is only applied if the `RebalancePartitions` is the root node, but sometimes, we expect a local sort after do RebalancePartitions that can improve the compression ratio.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT /*+ REBALANCE(c1) */ * FROM t SORT BY c1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-36184, we make validate easy that whether the rule introduces extra shuffle or not and the output partitioning is ensured by `AQEShuffleReadExec.outputPartitioning`.\r\n\r\nSo it is safe to make `OptimizeSkewInRebalancePartitions` support optimize non-root node.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nmaybe yes, if user do some operator after `RebalancePartitions`, the shuffle reader will be changed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLike `hadoop-common` and `hadoop-hdfs`, this PR proposes to exclude `hadoop-client-api` transitive dependency from `orc-core`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Hadoop 2.7 doesn't work on Java 17, Apache ORC has a dependency on Hadoop 3.3.1.\r\nThis causes `test-dependencies.sh` failure on Java 17 on `hadoop-2.7` profile.  As a result, `run-tests.py` also fails.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nConfirmed that `test-dependencyies.sh` works on Java 17 correctly because the transitive dependency is cut.\r\n```\r\nJAVA_HOME=/path/to/java17/ build/mvn -Phadoop-2.7 dependency:tree\r\n...\r\n[INFO] +-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to skip checking of ANSI interval types while creating or writing to a table using V2 catalogs. As the consequence of that, users can creating tables in V2 catalogs partitioned by ANSI interval columns (the legacy intervals of `CalendarIntervalType` are still prohibited). Also this PR adds new test which checks:\r\n1. Adding new partition with ANSI intervals via `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION`\r\n2. INSERT INTO a table partitioned by ANSI intervals \r\n\r\nfor V1/V2 In-Memory catalogs (skips V1 Hive external catalog).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo allow users saving of ANSI intervals as partition values using DSv2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test for V1/V2 In-Memory and V1 Hive external catalogs:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.v1.AlterTableAddPartitionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAlso post the event `SparkListenerExecutorRemoved` when removing an executor, which is known by `BlockManagerMaster` but unknown to `SchedulerBackend`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32114, it reports an issue that `BlockManagerMaster` could register a `BlockManager` from a dead executor due to reregistration mechanism. The side effect is, the executor will be shown on the UI as an active one, though it's already dead indeed.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32114, we tried to avoid such reregistration for a to-be-dead executor. However, I just realized that we can actually leave such reregistration alone since `HeartbeatReceiver.expireDeadHosts` should clean up those `BlockManager`s in the end. The problem is, the corresponding executors in UI can't be cleaned along with the `BlockManager`s cleaning. Because executors in UI can only be cleaned by `SparkListenerExecutorRemoved`, \r\n while `BlockManager`s  cleaning only post `SparkListenerBlockManagerRemoved` (which is ignored by `AppStatusListener`). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users would see the false active executor be removed in the end.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass existing tests.","created_at":"2021-11-09T15:13:49Z","updated_at":"2021-11-17T05:49:45Z","closed_at":"2021-11-12T00:18:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebda40bcf30d7a26c7275c7e29aa9680a4354b03","assignee":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34536/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34536/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34536/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ce22c0968fe86dbbdee31bceb233071c43d02c8f","head":{"label":"Ngone51:SPARK-35011","ref":"SPARK-35011","sha":"ce22c0968fe86dbbdee31bceb233071c43d02c8f","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that the `injectedFunctions` in `SparkSessionExtensions` can't be\r\nresolved correctly if it's referred by a temporary view. This is because the injected functions\r\nare not `UserDefinedExpression`. So they will be treated as temporary functions but couldn't\r\nbe captured as temporary functions during view creation. As a result, the function resolution\r\nwill fail if it's reffered by a temp view.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new concept `customBuiltinFunction`, so that the injected functions will be\r\ntreated as builtin functions intead of tempoary ones.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to handle ANSI interval types - `YearMonthIntervalType` and `DayTimeIntervalType` in `ColumnVectorUtils.populate()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR fixes the failure on reading of partitioned parquet files with ANSI interval partition values. The code below demonstrates the issue:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT INTERVAL '1' YEAR AS i, 0 as id\").write.partitionBy(\"i\").parquet(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/ansi_interval_parquet\")\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"i INTERVAL YEAR, id INT\").parquet(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/ansi_interval_parquet\").show(false)\r\n21/11/08 10:56:36 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 2.0 (TID 2)\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: DataType INTERVAL YEAR is not supported in column vectorized reader.\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.vectorized.ColumnVectorUtils.populate(ColumnVectorUtils.java:100)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.VectorizedParquetRecordReader.initBatch(VectorizedParquetRecordReader.java:243)\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, this PR fixes the issue above, and the code works as expected after the changes:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"i INTERVAL YEAR, id

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes `build_and_test.yml` to explicitly specify Java version for lint test on GA.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`lint-java` and `lint-scala` use Java so it's better to ensure the expected version of Java is used for the lint test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nGA

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change fixes `SPARK-34521`. It allows creating a spark DataFrame from a pandas DataFrame that is using a `StringDtype` column and arrow pyspark enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPandas stores string columns in two different ways: using a numpy `ndarray` or using a custom `StringArray`. The `StringArray` version is used when specifing the `dtype=string`. When that happens, spark cannot serialize the column to arrow. Converting the `Series` before fixes this problem. \r\n\r\nHowever, due to the different ways to handle string columns, doing `spark.createDataFrame(pandas_dataframe).toPandas()` might not equal to `pandas_dataframe`. The column dtype could be different.\r\n\r\nMore info: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/text.html\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nTrying to create a spark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check that ANSI intervals can be written as partitions dynamically, and read back as intervals if the  schema is set correctly. The last one requires a fix in `PartitioningUtils. AnsiIntervalType` to handle ANSI interval types and cast partition value strings to desired interval types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To check that ANSI intervals can be saved as partitions values\r\n2. To fix loading of ANSI intervals as partitions values. The example below demonstrates the issue:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT INTERVAL '1' YEAR AS i, 0 as id\").write.partitionBy(\"i\").json(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/ansi_interval_json\")\r\n\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"i INTERVAL YEAR, id INT\").json(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/ansi_interval_json\")\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to cast value `INTERVAL %271%27 YEAR` to `YearMonthIntervalType(0,0)` for partition column `i`\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.failedToCastValueToDataTypeForPartitionColumnError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:593)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.PartitioningUtils$.$anonfun$parsePartitions$13(PartitioningUtils.scala:204)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, this PR fixes the issues above. After the changes, the code works as expected:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"i INTERVAL YEAR, id

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to implement `DataFrame.mapInArrow` that allows users to apply a function with PyArrow record batches such as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something(iterator):\r\n    for arrow_batch in iterator:\r\n        # do something with `pyarrow.RecordBatch` and create new `pyarrow.RecordBatch`.\r\n        # ...\r\n        yield arrow_batch\r\n\r\ndf.mapInArrow(do_something, df.schema).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe general idea is simple. It shares the same codebase of `DataFrame.mapInPandas` except the pandas conversion logic.\r\n\r\nThis PR also piggy-backs:\r\n- Removes the check in `spark.udf.register` on `SQL_MAP_PANDAS_ITER_UDF`. This type is only used for `DataFrame.mapInPandas` internally, and it cannot be registered as a SQL UDF\r\n- Removes the type hints for `pandas_udf` that is used for internal purposes such as `SQL_MAP_PANDAS_ITER_UDF` and `SQL_COGROUPED_MAP_PANDAS_UDF`. Both cannot be used for `pandas_udf` as a SQL expression and it should be hidden to end users.\r\n\r\nNote that documentation will be done in another PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor usability and technical problems. Both are elabourated in more details at SPARK-37227.\r\nPlease also see the discussions at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26783.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR adds a new API:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\n\r\ndf = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    [(1, \"foo\"), (2, None), (3, \"bar\"), (4, \"bar\")], \"a int, b string\")\r\n\r\ndef func(iterator):\r\n    for batch in iterator:\r\n        # `batch` is pyarrow.RecordBatch.\r\n        yield batch\r\n\r\ndf.mapInArrow(func, df.schema).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and unit tests were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr enhance `PushPredicateThroughNonJoin` to support filter push down through window if window partition is empty. For example:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE t1 using parquet AS SELECT id AS a, id AS b FROM range(1000)\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY a) AS rn FROM t1) t WHERE rn > 100 and rn <= 200\").explain(true)\r\n```\r\nAfter this pr:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nFilter ((rn#3 > 100) AND (rn#3 <= 200))\r\n+- Window [row_number() windowspecdefinition(a#5L ASC NULLS FIRST, specifiedwindowframe(RowFrame, unboundedpreceding$(), currentrow$())) AS rn#3], [a#5L ASC NULLS FIRST]\r\n   +- GlobalLimit 200\r\n      +- LocalLimit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAllow saving and loading of ANSI intervals - `YearMonthIntervalType` and `DayTimeIntervalType` to/from the **Avro** datasource. After the changes, Spark saves ANSI intervals as primitive physical Avro types:\r\n- year-month intervals as `int`\r\n- day-time intervals as `long`\r\n\r\nw/o any modifications. To load the values as intervals back, Spark puts the info about interval types to the extra property `spark.sql.catalyst.type`:\r\n```\r\n$ java -jar avro-tools-1.9.2.jar getmeta part-00000-28176110-d0dc-4de7-81b8-31797c15c678-c000.avro\r\navro.schema\t{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"topLevelRecord\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"i\",\"type\":{\"type\":\"int\",\"spark.sql.catalyst.type\":\"interval year to month\"}}]}\r\norg.apache.spark.version\t3.3.0\r\navro.codec\tsnappy\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** The given PR focus on support of ANSI intervals in the Avro datasource via write or read as a column in `Dataset`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. At the moment, users can make ANSI intervals \"inside\" Spark, parallelize Java collections of `Period`/`Duration` objects or save/load to/from JSON, CSV, ORC, Parquet datasources but cannot save the intervals to **Avro** files. After the changes, users can save datasets/dataframes with year-month/day-time intervals to load them back later by Apache Spark.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select date'today' - date'2021-01-01' as diff\").write.format(\"avro\").save(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/avro_interval\")\r\n\r\nscala> val readback = spark.read.format(\"avro\").load(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/avro_interval\")\r\nreadback: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [diff: interval day]\r\n\r\nscala> readback.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- diff: interval day (nullable = true)\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> readback.show\r\n+------------------+\r\n|              diff|\r\n+------------------+\r\n|INTERVAL '309' DAY|\r\n+------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIn some sense, yes. Before the changes, users get an error while saving of ANSI intervals as dataframe columns to avro files but the operation should complete successfully after the changes. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *FileBasedDataSourceSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 \"test:testOnly *HiveOrcSourceSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-11-06T10:47:17Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T16:58:11Z","closed_at":"2021-11-08T15:15:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae8d936717fa6084025a95b1628468ab525aff20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34503/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34503/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34503/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7e6b22cc0d1aa37be62f0c52c029c0ad51904df6","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:avro-ansi-intervals-2","ref":"avro-ansi-intervals-2","sha":"7e6b22cc0d1aa37be62f0c52c029c0ad51904df6","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to optimize write path on RocksDB via removing unnecessary lookup. Removing unnecessary lookup unfortunately also disables the feasibility to track the number of rows, so this PR also introduces a new configuration for RocksDB state store provider to let end users turn it on and off based on their needs.\r\n\r\nThe new configuration is following:\r\n\r\n* config name: `spark.sql.streaming.stateStore.rocksdb.trackTotalNumberOfRows`\r\n* default value: true (since we already serve the number and we want to avoid breaking change)\r\n\r\nWe will give \"0\" for the number of keys in the state store metric when the config is turned off. The ideal value seems to be a negative one, but currently SQL metric doesn't allow negative value.\r\n\r\nWe will also handle the case the config is flipped during restart. This will enable the way end users enjoy the benefit but also not lose the chance to know the number of state rows. End users can turn off the flag to maximize the performance, and turn on the flag (restart required) when they want to see the actual number of keys (for observability/debugging/etc).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis addresses unnecessary lookup in write path, which only needs to track the number of rows. While the metric is a part of basic metrics for stateful operator, we can sacrifice some observability to gain performance on heavy write load.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, new configuration is added. This is neither a backward incompatible change nor behavior change, since default value of the flag is retaining the behavior as it is.\r\n\r\nBut there's a glitch regarding rolling back to previous Spark version: if you run query with turning the config off (so that the number of keys is lost) and restart the query in older Spark version, older Spark version will still try to track the number and the number will get messed up. You may want to turn the config on and run some micro-batches before going back to previous Spark version.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT. Benchmark will follow in next PR.","created_at":"2021-11-06T07:03:58Z","updated_at":"2021-11-18T19:51:54Z","closed_at":"2021-11-18T06:39:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e1fc7980af6ee73bd1e2613a5bbc7593d87ced17","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor sibling shuffle map stages, i.e. ones that share common child stages, reusing merger locations between them can help to further increase shuffle locality ratio when push based shuffle is enabled. Examples include Joins where the reduce stage needs to fetch shuffle data from multiple parent shuffle map stages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. This PR introduces a client-side config for push-based shuffle `spark.shuffle.push.reuse.merger.locations`. If push-based shuffle is turned-off then users will not see any change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34298/files#r734795801, Similar to ORC aggregate push down, we can disallow split input files for Parquet reader as well. See original comment for more details of motivation. Also fix the string of `RowDataSourceScanExec` to only print out `PushedAggregates` and `PushedGroupby`, to be aligned with `PushedLimit` and `PushedSample`, as there's not so many queries can benefit from aggregate push down, so we don't need to print those unnecessary information.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid unnecessary file splits in multiple tasks for Parquet reader with aggregate push down.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://docs.databricks.com/delta/quick-start.html#query-an-earlier-version-of-the-table-time-travel\r\n\r\nDelta Lake time travel allows user to query an older snapshot of a Delta table. To query an older version of a table, user needs to specify a version or timestamp in a SELECT statement using AS OF syntax as the follows\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM default.people10m VERSION AS OF 0;\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM default.people10m TIMESTAMP AS OF '2019-01-29 00:37:58';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the AS OF syntax support in Spark\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe following new SQL syntax will be supported:\r\n\r\nDelta Lake time travel syntax\r\n- VERSION AS OF\r\n- TIMESTAMP AS OF\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM default.people10m VERSION AS OF 0;\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM default.people10m TIMESTAMP AS OF '2019-01-29 00:37:58';\r\n```\r\nIn order to be compatible with HIVE time travel syntax https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-25344 and temporal features in SQL2011 https://sigmodrecord.org/publications/sigmodRecord/1209/pdfs/07.industry.kulkarni.pdf, we will also support\r\n\r\n- FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF\r\n- FOR SYSTEM_VERSION AS OF\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM default.people10m FOR SYSTEM_VERSION AS OF 0;\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM default.people10m FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2019-01-29 00:37:58';\r\n```\r\n\r\nApplication can also specify time travel version or timestamp using `DataFrameReader` as follows:\r\n```\r\ndf1 = spark.read.format('delta').option('timestampAsOf', '2019-01-01').load('/mnt/delta/people-10m')\r\n\r\ndf2 = spark.read.format('delta').option('versionAsOf', 2).load('/mnt/delta/people-10m')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order for `DataFrameReader` to get the time travel options such as `timestampAsOf` or `versionAsOf`, we will add the following new APIs in `SupportsCatalogOptions`:\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Extracts the timestamp string for time travel from the given options.\r\n   */\r\n  default Optional<String> extractTimeTravelTimestamp(CaseInsensitiveStringMap options) {\r\n    return Optional.empty();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Extracts the version string for time travel from the given options.\r\n   */\r\n  default Optional<String> extractTimeTravelVersion(CaseInsensitiveStringMap options) {\r\n    return Optional.empty();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIn addition, a couple of new APIs in `TableCatalog` will be added to support time travel:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTable loadTable(Identifier ident, String version)\r\n\r\nTable loadTable(Identifier ident, long timestamp)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, please see section 2\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnew

In this PR, the [timestamp types](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#timestamp) of Parquet are mapped to the two timestamp types in Spark:\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr colspan=\"3\">\r\n        <th colspan=\"3\">Parquet type</th>\r\n        <th>Spark Catalyst Type</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td rowspan=\"4\">INT64 Timestamp</td>\r\n        <td rowspan=\"2\">isAdjustedToUTC = false</td>\r\n        <td>unit = MILLIS</td>\r\n        <td>TimestampNTZType</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>unit = MICROS</td>\r\n        <td>TimestampNTZType</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td rowspan=\"2\">isAdjustedToUTC = true</td>\r\n        <td>unit = MILLIS</td>\r\n        <td>TimestampType</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>unit = MICROS</td>\r\n        <td>TimestampType</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>INT96 Timestamp</td>\r\n        <td> - </td>\r\n        <td> - </td>\r\n        <td> TimestampType </td>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n#### Parquet writer\r\nFor TIMESTAMP_NTZ columns, it follows the Parquet Logical Type Definitions and sets the field `isAdjustedToUTC` as `false` on writing TIMESTAMP_NTZ columns. The output type is always INT64 in the MICROS time unit. Parquet's timestamp logical annotation can only be used for INT64 so that we won't support writing TIMESTAMP_NTZ as INT96. Otherwise, it is hard to decide the timestamp type on the reader side.\r\n\r\n#### Parquet reader\r\n\r\n- INT96 columns: The reader behavior is the same with Spark 3.2 or prior.\r\n- Schema inference for INT64 Timestamp columns: for schema inference of one file, Spark infers TIMESTAMP_NTZ or TIMESTAMP_LTZ type according to the annotation flag `isAdjustedToUTC`.\r\n- Row converter for INT64 Timestamp columns during reading\r\n    - Given a TIMESTAMP_NTZ Parquet column and a catalyst schema of TIMESTAMP_LTZ type, Spark **allows** the read \r\n       operation since TIMESTAMP_LTZ is the \"wider\" type.\r\n    - Given a TIMESTAMP_LTZ Parquet column and a catalyst schema of TIMESTAMP_NTZ type, Spark **disallows** the read operation since TIMESTAMP_NTZ is the \"narrower\" type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-29295 introduces a mechanism that writes to external tables is a dynamic partition method, and the data in the target partition will be deleted first.\r\n\r\nAssuming that 1001 partitions are written, the data of 10001 partitions will be deleted first, but because `hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions` is 1000 by default, loadDynamicPartitions will fail at this time, but the data of 1001 partitions has been deleted.\r\n\r\nSo we can check whether the number of dynamic partitions is greater than `hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions` before deleting, it should fail quickly at this time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid data that cannot be recovered when the job fails.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince #YARN-3813/2.9.0/3.0.0, YARN supports ApplicationTimeouts. It helps enforce lifetime application SLAs. Currently, lifetime indicates the overall time spent by an application in YARN. It is calculated from its submit time to finish time, including running time and the waiting time for resource allocation.\r\n\r\nYARN allows admins to set lifetime of an application at leaf-queue. It also allows users to set it programmatically. During application submission, user can set it in  `ApplicationSubmissionContext#setApplicationTimeouts(Map<ApplicationTimeoutType, Long> applicationTimeouts)`.\r\n\r\nSo far, YARN supports for one timeout type - LIFETIME.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we `setApplicationTimeouts` when the YARN dependency is available, e.g. the default Hadoop 3.3 or user-specified Hadoop 2.9+ when Hadoop is provided at compile phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis can enforce the application SLAs.\r\nFor example, when the YARN queue is hit its limits of app concurrency or cpu/mem, an app will be pending for a very long time or even get stuck in  `ACCEPTED` state forever and do nothing. \r\n\r\nSometimes, users also may want their app to succeed or timeout/failed with proper time constraints.\r\n\r\nThis is necessary for end-users use spark througth serverless spark platform like apache kyuubi(incubating) to prevent issue like https://github.com/apache/incubator-kyuubi/issues/1039, https://github.com/apache/incubator-kyuubi/issues/278 and so on.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, we add a new conf but do not change the current behavior\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of #31427 , which introduced two issues:\r\n1. When we lookup `spark_catalog.t`, we failed earlier with `The namespace in session catalog must have exactly one name part` before that PR, now we fail very late in `CheckAnalysis` with `NoSuchTableException`\r\n2. The error message is a bit confusing now. We report `Table t not found` even if table `t` exists.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the 2 issues.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd configs to allow mapping the Spark gpu/fpga resource type to a custom YARN resource type. \r\nCurrently Spark hardcodes the mapping of resource \"gpu\" to \"yarn.io/gpu\" and \"fpga\" to \"yarn.io/fpga\". This PR just allows the user to specify the \"yarn.io/*\" resource side. \r\n\r\nNote it would be nice to put this in 3.2.1 as well, let me know if any objections.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nYARN supports custom resource types and in Hadoop 3.3.1 made it easier for users to plugin in custom resource types. This means users may create a custom resource type that represents a GPU or FPGAs because they want additional logic that the YARN built in versions don't have.  Ideally Spark users still just  use the generic \"gpu\" or \"fpga\" types in Spark.  So this adds that ability so Spark end users don't need to know about changes to YARN resource types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nConfigs added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTested manually with Hadoop 3.3.1 plugin https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/DevelopYourOwnDevicePlugin.html\r\nand unit tests added here.","created_at":"2021-11-04T18:10:04Z","updated_at":"2021-11-08T14:47:15Z","closed_at":"2021-11-05T21:19:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f2345e48fd8aa7750ba1452334f7929deff1c0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34485/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34485/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34485/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c68b268a1f67c5cd23aa246a01f53531fc1d8aed","head":{"label":"tgravescs:migyarnlatest","ref":"migyarnlatest","sha":"c68b268a1f67c5cd23aa246a01f53531fc1d8aed","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a minor folllowup that proposes to move `python/pyproject.toml` to `dev/pyproject.toml`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`pyproject.toml` can potentially affect how PySpark package interacts with pip. For example, the fork of PySpark in Databricks attempts to build a wheel as a test. Previously, it passed permissively but now it fails as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: Could not build wheels for pyspark, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `python/pyproject.toml` is only for tests, it should be best to minimise such potential impact.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested in the CI of the fork.","created_at":"2021-11-04T01:44:44Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:52:17Z","closed_at":"2021-11-05T02:42:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c6d20a8610be7fec26cfb8e2079e30e0a5f2936","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/efe2675c785ae1b59a658157c1b9b8d5b49f8d40","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-36989-followup","ref":"SPARK-36989-followup","sha":"efe2675c785ae1b59a658157c1b9b8d5b49f8d40","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pull request synchronizes `RDD.toDF` annotations with `SparkSession.createDataFrame` and `SQLContext.createDataFrame` variants.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it fixes recent regression in `SQLContext.createDataFrame` (SPARK-37077), where `RDD` is no longer consider a valid input.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Adds support for providing `str` schema.\r\n- Add supports for converting `RDDs` of \"atomic\" values, if schema is provided.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it introduces a `TypeVar` representing supported \"atomic\" values. This was done to avoid issue with manual data tests, where the following\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsc.parallelize([1]).toDF(schema=IntegerType())\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in \r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: No overload variant of \"toDF\" of \"RDD\" matches argument type \"IntegerType\"  [call-overload]\r\nnote: Possible overload variants:\r\nnote:     def toDF(self, schema: Union[List[str], Tuple[str, ...], None] = ..., sampleRatio: Optional[float] = ...) -> DataFrame\r\nnote:     def toDF(self, schema: Union[StructType, str, None] = ...) -> DataFrame\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen `Union` type is used (this problem doesn't surface when non-self bound is used).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nType checker only.\r\n\r\nPlease note, that these annotations serve primarily to support documentation, as checks on `self` types are still very limited.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests and manual data tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n__Note__:\r\n\r\nUpdated data tests to reflect new expected traceback, after

After the change, \r\n`assert(namedObservation.get === Map(\"percentile_approx_val\" -> 49))`\r\n`java.io.NotSerializableException` will not happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix `NotSerializableException` when observe with `TypedImperativeAggregate`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This PR change the implement of `AggregatingAccumulator` who

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a new function wrapper called `RegisteredSimpleFunction`, so that we can identify\r\nthe functions among all the expressions. Because of this, when creating temp views,\r\nwe can collect all temporary functions created both by SQL or catalog API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfix regression. After we choose to store the sql text instead of a logical plan for a view, we couldn't\r\ncollect the temporary functions registered by catalog API. For example:\r\n```scala\r\nval func = CatalogFunction(FunctionIdentifier(\"tempFunc\", None), ...)\r\nval builder = (e: Seq[Expression]) => e.head\r\nspark.sessionState.catalog.registerFunction(func, Some(builder))\r\nsql(\"create temp view tv as select temp1(a, b) from values (1, 2) t(a, b)\")\r\nsql(\"select * from tv\").collect()\r\n```\r\nWe will get an exception for the above code:\r\n```\r\nUndefined function: 'tempFunc'. This function is neither a registered temporary function nor a permanent function registered in the database 'default'.;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, it's a bug-fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnewly added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplements a vectorized version of the parquet reader for DELTA_BINARY_PACKED encoding\r\nThis PR includes a previous PR for this issue which passed the read request thru to the parquet implementation and which was not vectorized. The current PR builds on top of that PR (hence both are included).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently Spark throws an exception when reading data with these encodings if vectorized reader is enabled\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdditional unit tests for the encoding for both long and integer types (mirroring the unit tests in the Parquet implementation)","created_at":"2021-11-02T22:13:05Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T19:42:02Z","closed_at":"2022-01-05T17:53:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a4f5e7fa16a2706916409e318792132dad3bcc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6bb21f07415c30f7218547df43f3fa03ee66da48","head":{"label":"parthchandra:SPARK-36879-PR1","ref":"SPARK-36879-PR1","sha":"6bb21f07415c30f7218547df43f3fa03ee66da48","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187921479,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc5MjE0Nzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"parthchandra/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPass a new parameter `dynamicPartition` to `FileFormatWriter.write` so that we can distinguish if we need local sort or not.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid unnecessary sort in FileFormatWriter if it's not dynamic partition\r\n\r\n`FileFormatWriter.write` will sort the partition and bucket column before writing. I think this code path assumed the input `partitionColumns` are dynamic but actually it's not. It now is used by three code path:\r\n- `FileStreamSink`; it should be always dynamic partition\r\n- `SaveAsHiveFile`; it followed the assuming that `InsertIntoHiveTable` has removed the static partition and `InsertIntoHiveDirCommand` has no partition\r\n- `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`; it passed `partitionColumns` into `FileFormatWriter.write` without removing static partition because we need it to generate the partition path in `DynamicPartitionDataWriter`\r\n\r\nIt shows that the unnecessary sort only affected the `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` if we write data with static partition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nIt should not affect the existed behavior, just improve perf.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDynamicJoinSelection.shouldDemoteBroadcastHashJoin will prevent AQE from converting Sort merge join into a broadcast join because SMJ is faster when the side that would be broadcast has a lot of empty partitions.\r\nThis makes sense for inner joins which can short circuit if one side is empty.\r\nFor (left,right) outer join, the streaming side still has to be processed so demoting broadcast join doesn't have the same advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it may cause AQE to choose BHJ more often than before with better performance\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nSpark UTs\r\nAlso empirical

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR improves error messages for `Cast` when ANSI mode is enabled. See [Cast](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-ansi-compliance.html#cast) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make error messages under ANSI mode more actionable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Certain error messages will be changed.\r\n\r\nFor example `SELECT next_day(\"xx\", \"Mon\")`\r\nBefore\r\n```\r\njava.time.DateTimeException\r\nCannot cast xx to DateType.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n```\r\njava.time.DateTimeException\r\nCannot cast xx to DateType. To return NULL instead, use 'try_cast'. If necessary set spark.sql.ansi.enabled to false to bypass this error.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the code in `StructType` to allow merging `DecimalType` values with different precision but the same scale. \r\n\r\nWe could allow merging DecimalType values with different precision if the scale is the same for both types since there should not be any data correctness issues as one of the types will be extended, for example, `DECIMAL(12, 2)` -> `DECIMAL(17, 2)`; however, this is not the case for upcasting when the scale is different - this would depend on the actual values.\r\n\r\nThis also affects Parquet schema merge which is where this issue was discovered originally.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFixes the issue of not allowing to consolidate different DecimalTypes when it should be fine to do so in case of the same scale value.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests in StructTypeSuite and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAt high level, created a helper method `getMapSizesByExecutorIdImpl` on which `getMapSizesByExecutorId` and `getPushBasedShuffleMapSizesByExecutorId` can rely. It takes a parameter `useMergeResult`, which helps to check if fetching merge result is needed or not, and pass it as `canFetchMergeResult` into `getStatuses`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDuring some stage retry cases, the `shuffleDependency.shuffleMergeEnabled` can be set to false, but there will be `mergeStatus` since the Driver has already collected the merged status for its shuffle dependency. If this is the case, the current implementation would set the enableBatchFetch to false, since there are mergeStatus, to cause the assertion in `MapOutoutputTracker.getMapSizesByExecutorId` failed:\r\n```\r\nassert(mapSizesByExecutorId.enableBatchFetch == true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix helps resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPassed the existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd Spark appname as a label to pods.\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n- there were a `SPARK_APP_ID_LABEL`: is the unique spark APP applicationId with spark prefix (like \"spark-{applicationId}\")\r\n- `SPARK_APP_NAME_LABEL` in this patch is the Spark APP name, it's more friendly and readable for k8s cluster maintainer to figure out the spark app name of specific pods. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThen we can find out all pods (driver/executor) list by using: `k get pods -l spark.app.name=xxx`, also can figure out the spark app name of specific pods.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd label to pods.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a config `spark.sql.ansi.allowCastBetweenDatetimeAndNumeric`to allow casting between Datetime and Numeric. The default value of the configuration is `false`.\r\nAlso, casting double/float type to timestamp should raise exceptions if there is overflow or the input is Nan/infinate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better adoption of ANSI SQL mode:\r\n- As we did some data science, we found that many Spark SQL users are actually using `Cast(Timestamp as Numeric)` and `Cast(Numeric as Timestamp)`. There are also some usages of `Cast(Date as Numeric)`.\r\n- The Spark SQL connector for Tableau is using this feature for DateTime math. e.g.\r\n `CAST(FROM_UNIXTIME(CAST(CAST(%1 AS BIGINT) + (%2 * 86400) AS BIGINT)) AS TIMESTAMP)`\r\n\r\nSo, having a new configuration can provide users an alternative choice on turning on ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, adding a config `spark.sql.ansi.allowCastBetweenDatetimeAndNumeric`to allow casting between Datetime and Numeric. The default value of the configuration is `false`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`PodGroup` is a group of pods with strong association and is mainly used in batch scheduling, is of a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) type in Kubernetes, PodGroup concept which was approved by  Kuberentes community in [KEP-583 Coscheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-scheduling/583-coscheduling).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1736354/139654361-5e05e42c-2904-4012-8663-00b235b76d09.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the PodGroup support for Kuberentes:\r\n- Add PodGroup configuration: Introduce configurations to enable PodGroup support: `spark.kubernetes.enablePodGroup`, and also adds two configurations (`spark.kubernetes.podgroup.min.[cpu|memory]`) to helps user specifing min CPU and min Memory for a PodGroup.\r\n- Add Volcano implementaions: if user specify the spark k8s scheduler as `volcano`, will create the PodGroup with minReousrce requirement in Volcano automically,  If available resources in the cluster cannot satisfy the requirement, no pod in the PodGroup will be scheduled.\r\n- Driver/Executor pod would be labeled with `scheduling.k8s.io/group-name` key and value s\"${kubernetesConf.resourceNamePrefix}-podgroup\".\r\n\r\nSuch as, user can use below configuration to request a group of pods with  4 CPU/ 8G Mem as min requirement, the volcano will help user create these pods if the meet the min requirement (4 CPUU, 8G Mem), If available resources in the cluster cannot satisfy the requirement, no pod in the PodGroup will be scheduled.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.driver.scheduler.name=volcano \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.enablePodGroup=true \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.podgroup.min.cpu=4 \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.podgroup.min.memory=8G \\\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvide feature to request minimum resources before scheduling jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, add podgroup related configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- UT\r\n- e2e test:\r\n```shell\r\n# Setup K8S\r\nminikube start --cpus 3 --memory 4096\r\nkubectl create serviceaccount spark\r\nkubectl

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange `JsonInferSchema#infer`'s exception handle logic to be aligned with `JacksonParser#parse`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo reduce behavior inconsistency, users can have the same expectation for schema infer and json parse when dealing with some malformed input.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nBefore this patch, json's inferring schema could be failed for some malformed input but succeeded when parsing.\r\nAfter this patch, they have the same exception handle logic.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded one new test and modify one exist test to cover the new case.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-01T08:15:35Z","updated_at":"2021-11-05T03:08:31Z","closed_at":"2021-11-02T09:40:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1a712a8cac31fb81cb1b6622534338b146cc8a84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34455/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34455/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34455/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8dae1818f724db02c2d26d9d235fca1ed3498f9b","head":{"label":"advancedxy:SPARK-37176","ref":"SPARK-37176","sha":"8dae1818f724db02c2d26d9d235fca1ed3498f9b","user":{"login":"advancedxy","id":807537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy","html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18693947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODY5Mzk0Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"advancedxy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"advancedxy","id":807537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy","html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy/spark","description":"Mirror

TABLESAMPLE is not supported by all the databases. It is implemented using postgresql in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce IO and improve performance. For SAMPLE, e.g. `SELECT * FROM t TABLESAMPLE (1 PERCENT)`, Spark retrieves all the data from table and then return 1% rows. It will dramatically reduce the transferred data size and improve performance if we can push Sample to data source side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. new interface `SupportsPushDownTableSample`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to pin the version of PySpark to be installed in the live notebook environment for tagged commits.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nI noticed that the PySpark `3.1.2` is installed in the live notebook environment even though the notebook is for PySpark `3.2.0`.\r\nhttp://spark.apache.org/docs/3.2.0/api/python/getting_started/index.html\r\n\r\nI guess someone accessed to Binder and built the container image with `v3.2.0` before we published the `pyspark` package to PyPi.\r\nhttps://mybinder.org/\r\n\r\nI think it's difficult to rebuild the image manually.\r\nTo avoid such accident, I'll propose this change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nConfirmed that if a commit is tagged, we can avoid building the container image with unexpected version of `pyspark` in Binder.\r\n```\r\n...\r\n  Downloading plotly-5.3.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (23.9 MB)\r\n^[[91mERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement
