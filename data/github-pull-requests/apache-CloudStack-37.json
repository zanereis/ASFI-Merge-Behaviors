Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nOn this PR [#2636]((https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/2636)), @rafaelweingartner proposed a consistent validation mechanism to select a storage pool to deploy a volume when a virtual machine is deployed or when a new data disk is allocated.\r\nThe following table presents the scenarios when the storage_pool supports or not a new data disk.\r\n\r\n| #\t| Disk offering tags\t| Storage tags\t| Does the storage support the disk offering?\t|\r\n|---| ---\t\t\t\t\t| ---\t\t\t| ---\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\r\n| 1\t| A,B\t\t\t\t\t| A\t\t\t\t| NO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\r\n| 2\t| A,B,C\t\t\t\t\t| A,B,C,D,X\t\t| YES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\r\n| 3\t| A,B,C\t\t\t\t\t| X,Y,Z\t\t\t| NO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\r\n| 4\t| null\t\t\t\t\t| A,S,D\t\t\t| YES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\r\n| 5\t| A\t\t\t\t\t\t| null\t\t\t| NO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\r\n| 6\t| null\t\t\t\t\t| null\t\t\t| YES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\r\n\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, this PR enables `updateDiskOfferingCmd` to edit storage pool tags for `diskoffering`. Thus, providing greater control to ADMINS decide where disks will be allocated.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

created 2 storage pools.\r\nStorage Pools:\r\n- spool01 \t        with tag hdd\r\n- spool02\t\twith tag hdd2\r\n\r\nAnd create one disk Offering:\r\n- Test \t\twithout tag\r\n\r\n#### Test 01\r\n- Create a volume using Test diskoffering\r\n- Attach the volume to an instance\r\n- Update the disk's diskoffering to another one that has a tag that does not have a corresponding Storage pool\r\n- Detach the volume\r\n- try to migrate the disk\r\n\r\n**Expected:** we expect an exception since no storage tags match with the diskoffering tag\r\n**Result:** \r\n```\r\nMigration target pool [null, tags:null] has no matching tags for volume [small, uuid:ce026b50-8b04-44d6-bb66-3d324b64ca7d, tags:fake]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Test 02\r\n- Using the same volume from Test 01\r\n- Update the disk's diskoffering tag to hdd2\r\n- try to migrate the disk to spool02\r\n\r\n**Expected:** Migrate the volume to spool02 storage.\r\n**Result:** all good, as expected\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for the OOBM Redfish protocol, implementing a Java client to send HTTP requests to Redfish supported systems.\r\n\r\nImplementation overview:\r\n- Redfish Java client: a Java Client for Redfish that makes Redfish actions available to the HA workflow via an OOB driver.\r\n- OOB Redfish driver: a new Out-of-band driver was created for Redfish, allowing to integrate the Redfish Client with the CloudStack Out-of-band management implementation.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nFixes: #3624\r\n\r\n**Thanks note:** this implementation had valuable help from our friends at [Yourhosting](https://www.yourhosting.nl/).\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\nConfigure OOBM with Redfish driver\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5025148/85565017-1fa1a380-b605-11ea-97d0-786d9eb976da.png)\r\nCheck OOBM host tab\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5025148/85565051-26c8b180-b605-11ea-9a5c-aa393ec44fa3.png)\r\nTest powering On and Off hosts. Host status is properly shown\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5025148/85567065-eff39b00-b606-11ea-94b2-7809aa5504be.png)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nWe have been able to test on Dell and Supermicro machines and it works fine:\r\n\r\n1. via the CloudStack UI, enable Redfish oob driver for a KVM node with support for Redfish\r\n2. verified that ACS can retrieve the redfish system ID and system power state\r\n3. powering Off node works as expected, host state transition worked well and the host was indeed powered off\r\n4. powering On also worked as expected, CloudStack host state transition as expected, host is indeed up again\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen a host connects to a management server, the host IP address and the certificate are stored in memory on the management server. This mapping is checked periodically to determine if any certificates are due to expire.\r\n\r\nBefore a certificate is renewed, a few checks are done to determine if the host is connected to the management server by fetching the host record from the database. The problem here is if the wrong record is fetched, the host is not checked for renewal.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the host record fetch from the database by looking only at hosts that are not removed.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\nFixes: #4129 \r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

This is to ensure that a certificate is up for renewal as soon as it is issued.\r\nThen watch the management server logs to see if auto-renewal happens.\r\n\r\nThis has also been tested by using two

Description\r\nThis fixes the issue of listVirtualMachinesMetrics to extend ListVMsCmd instead of ListVMsCmdByAdmin which is a potential security bug.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen a template is downloaded, the first 1MB of the template is validated to determine if the template is of correct file type. On failure, the download is aborted and the input stream is set to null. This leads to a second error when the try-with-resources block tries to auto-close the stream and throws an ioexception. The \"stream closed\" error message is then written to the db. \r\n\r\nThis PR checks if an error has been stored before setting a new error message.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\nFixes: #4127 \r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nFixes #4090\r\n\r\nWhen trying to migrate a VM across 2 clusters, if a snapshot has been deleted and garbage collection has run to update the removed field, it is not possible to migrate the instance due to a null pointer.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing

may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nThis has been tested by migrating an instance to another Xenserver cluster using XCP-NG as the hypervisor in both clusters.\r\n\r\nProcess to follow:\r\n\r\n* Create a zone with 2 clusters.\r\n* Create an instance in 1 cluster.\r\n* Take a root volume snapshot of the instance.\r\n* Delete the snapshot.\r\n* Wait for the removed field to be populated in the snapshots table.\r\n* Migrate the instance.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

For more details on this,  please see the documentation at [KVM volume Snapshot specifics](\r\nhttp://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/en/latest/adminguide/storage.html?highlight=kvm.snapshot.enabled#kvm-volume-snapshot-specifics) section.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the log message is not clear about why KVM does not support it. This PR enhances the log message so the user knows why there is such a limitation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nKVM Snapshot is not supported for Running VMs. It is disabled by default due to a possible volume corruption in certain cases. To enable it set global settings kvm.snapshot.enabled to True. See the documentation for more details.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

TransactionLegacy instances are tracked by TransactionMBeanImpl in a\r\nconcurrent hashmap.

This adds code to remove the TransactionLegacy\r\ninstance from the mbean when the instance is close().\r\n\r\n    NOTE: This only happens when the new B&R feature is enabled in 4.14.0.0, the sync thread seems to get stuck while performing DB query and ends up consuming most of the TransactionLegacy instances\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/3987\r\n\r\nLeaks seen by MAT:\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-06-01 16-47-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95203/83434109-7b8a6980-a457-11ea-88a5-30375dcc20cc.png)\r\n\r\nThe MBean explore shows a steady increase in  the leaks:\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-06-01 22-21-32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95203/83434055-69103000-a457-11ea-9501-fb3c20256a4c.png)\r\n\r\nserver: fix leak by moving backup usage updation via usage events\r\n\r\nBackupSync task would switch between databases to update backup usage\r\nmetrics in the cloud_usage.usage_backup table. The current framework\r\nand the usage in ManagedContext causes database connection\r\n(LegacyTransaction) leaks. When the thread runs faster, the issue is\r\neasily reproducible and checking via heap dump analysis or using JMX\r\nMBeans. This fixes by moving the task of backup data updation for\r\nusage data to the usage server by publishing usage events instead of\r\nswitching between databases in a local thread while in a\r\nManagedContextRunnable.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nSometimes a host is down (admins know) but CS keeps VMs in the 'Running' state to avoid data corruption. An example of that is when a KVM host using Ceph halts. CloudStack cannot check if VM still writing on disk, therefore it leaves it in the \"Running\" state and HA will not be triggered for those VMs.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, this PR proposes an API-call to declare a Host as \"Degraded\". All \"Running\"  VMs on that Host should then be set to 'Stopped' so HA can kick in.\r\n\r\n1. Command name: `declareHostAsDegraded`; parameters: id (id of the host); description: _Declare host as 'Degraded'. The host must be on 'Disconnected' or 'Alert' state._\r\n2. Command name: `cancelHostAsDegraded`; parameters: id (id of the host); description: _Cancel host status from 'Degraded'. The host will transit back to status 'Enabled'._\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n\r\nAdmin **MUST** check if there are VMs running on the problematic host and call such API command just if he/she is **100%** sure that can deploy the Running VMs on another host.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nExample of how host Resource State is shown on UI when a host is declared 'Degraded' (taken when this PR was using state \"Dead\"):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5025148/84510874-10813400-ac9c-11ea-8bff-580dc2c4d9a5.png)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n**Note:** tests were performed on two KVM hosts with HA enabled: _Host01_ and _Host02_.\r\n\r\n#### Test 01: declareHostAsDegraded\r\n**ha.force = false**\r\n1. Deploy VMs on host Host01\r\n- deploy 2 VMs shared storage, HA enabled (VM01, VM02)\r\n- deploy 1 VM shared storage, HA disabled (VM03)\r\n- deploy 1 VM local storage, HA disabled (VM04)\r\n2. Stop cloudstack-agent.service on Host1\r\n3. Run Virsh command to shutdown/destroy all VMs in Host10\r\n4. All VMs are in \"Running\" state, the host is in \"Disconnected\"\r\n5. call API command declareHostsAsDegraded\r\n- Host state migrated to \"Degraded\"\r\n- VMs with HA + Shared started on Host02 (transit from Running to Stopped, Stopped -> Starting, Starting -> Running)\r\n- VMs with no HA were marked as Stopped (transit from Running to Stopped, restart Scheduler ignores non-HA VMs)\r\n\r\n**ha.force=true**\r\n- Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 executed again.\r\n- VMs VM01, VM02, and VM03 got re-started by HA\r\n- VM04 did not start due to its local storage (this is the correct behavior).\r\n\r\nTest conclusion: all working as expected.\r\n\r\n#### Test 02:  cancelHostAsDegraded:\r\n1. Start cloudstack-agent.service on Host01\r\n2. Call API command cancelHostAsDegraded\r\n3. Assert that VMs can be deployed/migrated on Host01\r\nTest conclusion: all working as expected.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

This could definitely be fine tuned by someone who's more intimate with these scripts but I just wanted the issue fixed without interfering in the logic.\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing

Description\r\n\r\nCentralised logging capability.\r\n \r\nThis is an improvements to systemvm which allow Cloudstack administrator to access systemvms logs inside the management server. It removes the difficulty of downloading logs from systemvms. Logs are forwarded to the management server automatically, and administrators can access them in `/var/log/rsyslog/%HOSTNAME%/syslog`.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit the #4093 issue.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nCreated a Cloudstack environment with three KVM hypervisor and one management server.

Description\r\nThis feature allows administrators to unmanage guest virtual machines from CloudStack. Once unmanaged, CloudStack can no longer monitor, control or administer the provisioning and orchestration related operations on a virtual machine.\r\n\r\nA new API method has been added: `unmanageVirtualMachine`, accepting the virtual machine UUID as parameter The execution of this API method performs the unmanaging of a guest virtual machine. It has the following pre-conditions:\r\n\r\n- The virtual machine must not be destroyed\r\n- The virtual machine state must be 'Running’ or ‘Stopped’\r\n- The virtual machine must be a VMware virtual machine\r\n\r\nAssuming these pre-conditions are met, the API execution will perform the following pre-checks, failing if they are not met:\r\n\r\n- There are no volume snapshots associated with any of the virtual machine volumes\r\n- There is no ISO attached to the virtual machine\r\n\r\nAn additional check is performed prior to unmanaging the virtual machine from CloudStack: the hypervisor returns checks that the virtual machine exists, searching the virtual machine by its instance name. If it is not found, then the operation fails.\r\n\r\n### Global setting\r\nA new boolean zone setting has been added: `unmanage.vm.preserve.nics`, with default value = ‘false’. If set to true, the virtual machine NICs (and their MAC addresses) are preserved when unmanaging it. Otherwise, NICs are removed and MAC addresses can be reassigned.\r\n\r\n### Unmanaging virtual machine actions:\r\n- Clean up virtual machine NICs and deallocate network resources used such as IP addresses and DHCP entries on virtual routers.\r\n   - If ‘unmanage.vm.preserve.nics’ = ‘false’ then the NICs are deallocated and removed from CloudStack\r\n   - If ‘unmanage.vm.preserve.nics’ = ‘true’ then the NICs remain allocated and are not removed from the database. The NIC’s MAC addresses remain preserved and therefore cannot be assigned to any new NIC.\r\n- Clean up virtual machine volumes in the CloudStack database\r\n- Clean up virtual machine snapshots in the CloudStack database (if any) · Revoke host access to any managed volumes attached to the VM\r\n- Clean up the virtual machine from the following:\r\n   - Remove the virtual machine from security groups (if any)\r\n   - Remove the virtual machine from instance groups (if any)\r\n   - Remove firewall rules for the virtual machine (if any)\r\n   - Remove forwarding rules for the virtual machine (if any)\r\n   - Remove load balancing rules for the virtual machine (if any)\r\n   - Disable static NAT (if the virtual machine is assigned to it)\r\n   - Remove the virtual machine from affinity groups (if any)\r\n- Set VM details as removed in the CloudStack database\r\n- Decrement the account resources count for volumes and virtual machines\r\n- Generate usage events:\r\n   - For volumes destroyed, with type: ‘VOLUME.DELETE’\r\n   - For virtual machine snapshots destroyed (if any), with type: ‘VMSNAPSHOT.DELETE’\r\n   - For virtual machine NICs destroyed: with type: ‘NETWORK.OFFERING.REMOVE’\r\n   - For the virtual machine being unmanaged: stopped and destroyed usage events (similar as the generated usage events when expunging a virtual machine), with types: ‘VM.STOP’ and ‘VM.DESTROY\r\n\r\n### Changes on the VM import functionality\r\nA new parameter has been added to the `importUnmanagedInstances` API:\r\n- forced: booolean (false by default): If true, a VM is imported despite some of its NIC's MAC addresses being already present. The `forced` parameter is false by default and prevents importing a VM which has a NIC containing a MAC address that has been previously assigned by CloudStack. If it is set to true, the NICs with MAC addresses which already exist in the CloudStack database have the existing MAC addresses reassigned to its NICs.\r\n\r\nThe usage events generated when importing unmanaged instances have been refactored:\r\n- The usage event with type: ‘VM.IMPORT’ has been replaced by the usage event with type: ‘VM.CREATE’.\r\n-  If the imported VM is powered on, then the VM import feture generates the usage event with type: ‘VM.START’\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-27T00:42:47Z","updated_at":"2020-11-08T20:27:16Z","closed_at":"2020-06-26T11:31:44Z","merged_at":"2020-06-26T11:31:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"8c1d749360657a4909c558c3df5dec57ca66c977","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073207,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vmware","name":"component:vmware","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1150675549,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTUwNjc1NTQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"4471c4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/12","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/12","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/12/labels","id":4965208,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDk2NTIwOA==","number":12,"title":"4.15.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"andrijapanicsb","id":45762285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzYyMjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45762285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb","html_url":"https://github.com/andrijapanicsb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":242,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-12-31T11:55:38Z","updated_at":"2021-01-11T08:58:34Z","due_on":"2020-12-24T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-01-11T08:58:34Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/4103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/4103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/4103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/ad672c3280162ced801cd9bf951833097379a088","head":{"label":"shapeblue:unmanageinstances","ref":"unmanageinstances","sha":"ad672c3280162ced801cd9bf951833097379a088","user":{"login":"shapeblue","id":6001764,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYwMDE3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6001764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue","html_url":"https://github.com/shapeblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shapeblue/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35481491,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQ4MTQ5MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"shapeblue/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sh

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThe handling of the exception of RabbitMQ `getConnection()` method can be improved.\r\nExample of issues that I have noticed:\r\n```\r\nFailed to create a connection to AMQP server due to null\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot all exceptions hold a message; therefore, some exceptions might result in a `null` output instead of the Exception message/stack.\r\n\r\nWith the fix, the error message looks like:\r\n```\r\nFailed to create a connection to AMQP server [AMQP host:amqp.host.org, port:123] due to: java.net.UnknownHostException: amqp.host.org: Name or service not known\r\nFailed to create a connection to AMQP server [AMQP host:null, port:null] due to: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused (Connection refused)\r\n```\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

upgrade to support newer algorithms\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nCloudStack is using the trilead-ssh2 library for ssh communications, but doesn't have support for the latest MAC algorithms, which can be a blocker of adopting Cloudstack for certain companies with more strict security requirements.\r\n\r\nThe issue with the current version of trilead-ssh2 is that it is only supporting older MAC algorithms, so if one would like to add a hypervisor host to a cluster and the host runs a sshd with old algos excluded, it will be unable to add the host.\r\n\r\nThere's a forked version of trilead-ssh2 which is still being maintained.\r\nUpgrade to this fork/version of trilead-ssh2 would provide the possibility to use newer algorithms for SSH without the need to touch actual business logic. \r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/3255\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nRefactor on `UsageManagerImpl.createVPNUserEvent`. Currently, the present method creates and removes a VPN user event.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds minor version support when mounting nfs on the SSVM as requested in #2861 \r\n\r\nThe global setting \"secstorage.nfs.version\" has been changed to use String data type which allows any minor version to be specified.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nAdvanced Network with Security Groups is a great option for deploying a Zone with IPv6 address support. However, it is not possible to set **IPv6 DNS** + **IPv6 CIDR** + **IPv6 gateway** via the zoneWizard UI.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the workaround is to either (i) create a new network (the default guest network would not support IPv6), (ii) deploy a zone via API, or (iii) to run a MySQL update query to set the default guest network IPv6 config.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a small enhancement on the UI Zone deployment to allow deploying a Zone with Advanced Network with Security Groups + IPv6 CIDR, IPv6 gateway, and IPv6 DNS.\r\n\r\nNote that API [[1]](https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.13/apis/createNetwork.html) offers full support for such action, therefore there is no need for changing the API. It is just a small enhancement on UI that might be useful in the meantime that we wait for the new ACS UI.\r\n\r\n[1] https://cloudstack.apache.org/api/apidocs-4.13/apis/createNetwork.html\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nThis update turns on certificate revocation checking for uploaded certificates:\r\n\r\n- Updated `CertServiceImpl` to be able to enable revocation checking.\r\n- Introduced a new parameter `ENABLED_REVOCATION_CHECK` for `UploadSslCertCmd`.\r\n- Updated `CertServiceTest`.\r\n\r\nEven if no CLRs are specified via `PKIXParameters`, the certificates\r\nthemselves may still provide info for revocation checking:\r\n\r\n- The AIA extension may contains a URL to the OCSP responder.\r\n- The CLRDP extension contains a URL to the CLR.\r\n\r\nThose extensions may need to be explicitly enabled by setting the system properties `com.sun.security.enableAIAcaIssuers` and `com.sun.security.enableCRLDP` to true. See [Java PKI Programmer's Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/security/java-pki-programmers-guide.html).\r\n\r\nUsing a revoked certificate may be dangerous. One of the most common reasons why a certificate authority (CA) revokes a certificate is that the private key has been compromised. For example, the private key might have been stolen by an adversary.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, the `CertServiceImpl` bean is used for operations with certificates on a load balancer. In particular, it validates a certificate chain without revocation checking while uploading a certificate. If a compromised revoked certificate is then used by the load balancer, then it may result to compromising TLS connections. However, the attacker has to be able to implement man-in-the-middle attack to compromise the connections. So the attacker has to be quite powerful. Therefore, such an attack is definitely not easy to implement. On the other hand, the impact may be significant because of loss of confidentiality.\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed on security@cloudstack.apache.org\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an

Description\r\nIf the template from which VR is created got deleted, the state\r\nis set to inactive and removed to null.\r\nSince the template is already deleted, the VR can't be created\r\nusing this template again.\r\n\r\nIf someone restarts network with cleanup then it will try to\r\ndeploy the vr from the old non existing template again.\r\nSo search only for active template which are not yet deleted.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a sentence to all CIDR_LIST and DEST_CIDR_LIST API parameter and return value annotations that documents how to pass a list of CIDRs.\r\n\r\nThis is a rarely used feature, but may be necessary for certain scenarios, such as automatic firewall rule generation/matching, VPNs with multiple routed networks, etc.\r\n\r\nThere may be other cases where the APIs accept lists, but this was out of scope for this PR.\r\n \r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nI tested what values the API calls createFirewallRule and createLoadBalancerRule accept for the cidrlist parameter, and what is returned in listFirewallRules and listLoadBalancerRules.\r\n\r\nAnything besides a single comma is not accepted.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, createFirewallRule returns an error because the parameter is deprecated.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the
