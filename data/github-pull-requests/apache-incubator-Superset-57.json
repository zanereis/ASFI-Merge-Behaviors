SUMMARY\r\nLegacy PivotTable throw an invalid exception caused by missing jQuery library in to embedded template.\r\nI just added missing script tag to avoid this problem.

to convert `SqlEditor`'s Enzyme tests to React Testing Library with a secondary goal of removing act errors.\r\n\r\nMost tests were checking if a component rendered or not. So the changes made were to render with RTL and check if a visual element that the user would only see if the component were or weren't there, instead of checking whether the component itself exists.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- cd into `superset-frontend`\r\n- `npm run test -- src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditor/SqlEditor.test.jsx`\r\n- Check for passing tests and act errors\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nLegacy PivotTable throw an invalid exception caused by missing jQuery library in to embedded template.\r\nI just added missing script tag to avoid this problem.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR adds a 'select all' functionality to the synchronous Select component. This functionality has been requested by a large number of users and contributors. The select component has been previously split into sync and async components to simplify the code. The sync select component is the more widely used component, and a select all for the sync case is much easier to implement. This PR simply adds the option for selectAllEnabled only when the select component is in multi-select mode. The option is by default set to false. This is part of the greater task to rework the select component for the select all functionality outlined by @michael-s-molina in this PR: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20143\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nImplements a custom tooltip positioning function that ensures that the tooltip never overlaps with the pointer during normal use. In addition this fixes a bug that would cause the tooltip to stay on screen if the tooltip was visible when the user navigated away from the page.\r\n\r\nThis PR also cleans up some types on the ECharts plugin package (these kinda needed to be fixed as the code was becoming difficult to manage.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow tooltips are allowed to overflow other charts:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/203587143-d3604907-5412-4d9f-96c1-415bdcff2439.mp4\r\n\r\nIn addition, the sticky hover bug is also gone:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/203587757-8f91b009-b68d-403c-b425-de9cdecb5738.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nBefore, the pointer would overflow the tooltip if the chart was small enough and never utilized free space next to the chart:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/203589170-ceb21fe3-4745-443e-bf7f-2ee8209dd407.mp4\r\n\r\nAlso navigating away from the page with the chart would sometimes leave the tooltip stuck in the middle of the screen:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/203589238-961925bb-9f31-4326-8f3d-aa3b3d013dcb.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to eph env and open the \"tooltip test\" dashboard.\r\n2. Try to make the tooltip overlap the pointer of fall outside the screen (note that scrolling can still make the tooltip go outside)\r\n3. Navigate away from the dashboard page while the tooltip is open (by using keyboard shortcuts) - the tooltip will no longer be stuck on the screen after navigation.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue\r\n\r\n\r\n:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere is no database driver for Amazon DynamoDB so far. I developed a Python DB API 2.0 (PEP 249) client for Amazon DynamoDB and did some work to be compatible with Superset. My Project is [here](https://github.com/passren/PyDynamoDB). The latest version is 0.4.2 which have already supported Superset connector.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7568620/200768289-242505e7-b8f2-4ea9-8e64-97303f8806c2.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nAdd the unit test for db_engine_spec of pydynamodb.\r\nFor the setup in the Superset, please refer to the doc in my project.\r\nhttps://github.com/passren/PyDynamoDB/wiki/5.-Superset\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases\">react-router-dom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>react-router-dom@6.4.0-pre.15</h2>\n<h3>Patch Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>fix: remove internal router singleton (<a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/HEAD/packages/react-router-dom/issues/9227\">#9227</a>)</p>\n<p>This change removes the internal module-level <code>routerSingleton</code> we create and maintain inside our data routers since it was causing a number of headaches for non-simple use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unit tests are a pain because you need to find a way to reset the singleton in-between tests\n<ul>\n<li>Use use a <code>_resetModuleScope</code> singleton for our tests</li>\n<li>...but this isn't exposed to users who may want to do their own tests around our router</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The JSX children <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> objects cause non-intuitive behavior based on idiomatic react expectations\n<ul>\n<li>Conditional runtime <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>'s won't get picked up</li>\n<li>Adding new <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>'s during local dev won't get picked up during HMR</li>\n<li>Using external state in your elements doesn't work as one might expect (see <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/HEAD/packages/react-router-dom/issues/9225\">#9225</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead, we are going to lift the singleton out into user-land, so that they create the router singleton and manage it outside the react tree - which is what react 18 is encouraging with <code>useSyncExternalStore</code> anyways! This also means that since users create the router - there's no longer any difference in the rendering aspect for memory/browser/hash routers (which only impacts router/history creation) - so we can get rid of those and trim to a simple <code>RouterProvider</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>// Before\nfunction App() {\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n      &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;/Route&gt;\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n}\n<p>// After\nlet router = createBrowserRouter([{\npath: &quot;/&quot;,\nelement: &lt;Layout /&gt;,\nchildren: [{\nindex: true,\nelement: &lt;Home /&gt;,\n}]\n}]);</p>\n<p>function App() {\nreturn &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>If folks still prefer the JSX notation, they can leverage <code>createRoutesFromElements</code> (aliased from <code>createRoutesFromChildren</code> since they are not &quot;children&quot; in this usage):</p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>let routes = createRoutesFromElements(\n  &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n  &lt;/Route&gt;\n);\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21713 —via `git revert`. @zhaoyongjie and @villebro though I love the essence of this PR—which is somewhat akin to what Tableau does; making SQL more attainable especially as it relates to handling `NULL`—sadly I don't believe the change is ready for primetime. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. Aspects of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21713#pullrequestreview-1132542047 haven't been addressed.\r\n2. The `None` use case never materializes as far as I'm concerned (see attached screenshots) given that this is interpreted as the string `'None'`. \r\n3. The `CUSTOM SQL` tab in the ad-hoc filter modal doesn't reflect the `SIMPLE` tab logic and thus there's a disconnect between the SQL rendered in the modal and the executed SQL (see attached screenshots). \r\n4. We already have the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` options which this functionality is replacing. Collectively as a community we need to decide whether the filters map one-to-one with SQL—which is currently how the ad-hoc filter model is defined given the symbiotic relationship between the `SIMPLE` and `CUSTOM SQL` tabs—or should depart from SQL and represent what is commonly perceived user intent, especially if users aren't well versed with the nuances when handling NULLs. \r\n \r\nI think for consistency it first makes sense to revert said logic before the issues/inconsistencies have been addressed. Furthermore such a change could actually break existing charts—if the author was unaware of the nuances around `NULL`—and thus a line item in UPDATING.md is likely required so various installations can send out the appropriate PSA to their users. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### Handling of None\r\n\r\n##### SIMPLE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"349\" alt=\"Screen Shot

SUMMARY\r\nThere's [an open issue](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/11123) that is hard to distinguish icons between running and successful query state in sqllab.\r\n~This commit adds the animated dimming translation for running statue to be distinguishing the running state easily.~\r\nThis commit updates the icon color for running state to be distinguishing the running and finish states. It also adds the icons for success and fail status to help red/green colorblind to distinguish the color status.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n- Before:\r\n\r\n<img

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nlong history but schema and table selector isn't enabled the reload feature when [Dataset creation modal implemented](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/10104/files#diff-8c9115b0992f26d4cd78ff12e49f36832c9c0478e660c9e80c233b6f7366aabfR370).\r\n\r\nDue to the cached dataset, user cannot create a new dataset using \"Add dataset\" modal when a new table recently added. In order to do so, user must hit the refresh request on sqllab page and then reload the modal again.\r\n\r\nThis commit enables the refresh button for formMode (which is only used on DatasetModal) in order to reduce the UX inconvenience. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"660\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-03 at 3 28 48 PM\"

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI'm not exactly sure why this issue didn't surface prior to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21936 when `np.vectorize` was being leveraged, but the JSON serialization failed when an `np.array` was undefined, i.e., `np.array(None)`, i.e., in SQL Lab one would see the following,\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnserializable object None of type <class 'numpy.ndarray'>\r\n```\r\n\r\nif the column was an array but the array was null.\r\n\r\nThe issue was that the `base_json_conv` treated a return value of `None` as representing an object which wasn't able to be converted however some converted types can have a return value of `None`, i.e., `np.array(None).tolist()` is `None`. \r\n\r\nThe fix is to make `base_json_conv` raise a `TypeError` if the type is unknown and to reorganize the logic for the JSON serializers. See the inline comments for more details.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nAdded unit

Originally, the value for this color was held in a local variable that referenced [this line from our LESS variables file](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/assets/stylesheets/less/variables.less#L34), but was assigned to the color `#F5F5F5`.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR implements support for changing the native filters bar location.\r\n\r\n1. Clicking on menu items updates Redux state (`dashboardInfo.filterBarLocation`) and sends a PUT request to `api/v1/dashboard/{id}` endpoint with updated `json_metadata`.\r\n2. Initial Redux state of `dashboardInfo.filterBarLocation` is populated in dashboard's `hydrate` function\r\n3. Clicking on menu item applies checkmark next to selected item immediately, without waiting for backend response (for better user experience). If backend returns an error, the selection is reverted. The actual position of the filter bar depends on backend response.\r\n4. If there's an error, a toast message appears\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/199560452-ad5b52dc-5505-479f-9475-1d8ce964fb72.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `HORIZONTAL_FILTER_BAR` ff\r\n2. Go to dashboard and click on a gear icon in native filters bar\r\n3. Verify that clicking on menu items dispatches Redux actions and API requests with the new `filter_bar_location` in the body\r\n4. Verify that if an error occurs (by for example disconnecting your internet), then a toast message appears, selection in gear icon menu is reverted and no Redux action related to filter bar is dispatched\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn #21968, it replaces the `json-bigint` by `json-bigint-native` to fix the invalid float number handling by escaping BigNumber(BigInt) wrapper.\r\nHowever, `json-bigint-native` uses native BigInt only which has limit compatibility of Math functions that throws [TypeError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Cant_convert_BigInt_to_number) several cases.\r\n\r\nThis commit reverts the commit in order to keep it back to use `BigNumber` (which is compatible with Math functions).\r\nInstead it adds a custom logic to escape the BigNumber for floating numbers. It also adds a `todo` comment to fix the root cause by open source in the future.\r\n\r\ncc: @john-bodley @ktmud @villebro @zhaoyongjie \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Background\r\nThis PR intends to introduce a new control that `XAxisSortControl` and a new post-processing operator. The goal is to resolve whether the axis could be sorted by the `x-axis` or any metric. \r\n\r\nBefore introducing this feature, let's talk about some of the current sorting logic. There are two kinds of sorting logic on the current master branch.\r\n\r\n1) **order by** on the **main query** if `Sort By` is set on the control panel\r\n<img width=\"409\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/200323352-464593fb-3168-46a2-87d3-8bc21eeff102.png\">\r\n\r\n2) **order by** on the **main query** and the **sub-query** if `Series limit` and `Dimensions` is given.\r\n<img width=\"406\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/200324134-b3af8cf7-78a5-469a-a7f2-d6dec25a7b15.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth of these sorting methods are sorting on query data results, which means that these sorting occurs at the database stage. The limitation of this approach is that we cannot sort the pivot results. For example, timeseries charts(echart version) are pivoted charts.\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\n\r\nImagine that there are request for such analysis, but the data sorting is kept to a fixed metric(in the other words, the database should return static topN):\r\n1. Bar chart should sort the bar by one of several metrics, for example, there are `sum(sales)`, `max(sales)` in the metrics, but the `max(sales)` should be sorted.\r\n2. Bar chart should sort the bar by the x-axis values.\r\n\r\nThis PR is designed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Limitation\r\nThe current design doesn't support multiple series(dimensions control in the control panel). The reason is that the extra query should be provided for this use case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/200834806-3fed22f8-1344-4818-add0-c7440153f72a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a follow up PR based on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21922 (So I'd suggest checking that one first so we can rebase this PR).

SUMMARY\r\nWe're seeing some sqlalchemy errors related to the dual writes of the sip68 models, so I'm removing the dual writing so that we can decide whether to move forward again and do another backfill migration or start over smaller with one model at a time. We also haven't been writing permissions to the models, so we would need to run a migration for that in the future regardless of whether we stopped dual writing or not, so it seemed to make sense to take a step back and stop the errors for now. \r\n\r\nI also fixed a test on dataset deletion due to sqlalchemy not having access to the database relationship in the session. The fix was to eagerly load the database with the dataset on lookup. I found other logs of this happening for this command, and fixed it here for the tests to pass. There was a query in the after update hook that I removed that was re-loading the database into the session as an unexpected side-effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nNormal dataset crud operations should work as normal.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nMany small improvements to error handling:\r\n- Map exceptions from the `requests` library to Superset exceptions for both Trino and Druid (both use `requests` for communication, and has \"clean\" error messages that shouldn't contain sensitive info)\r\n- In SQL Lab, both table and schema metadata requests only show a generic error message on failure; this adds the error message to provide additional context on what the error was.\r\n- In Explore, unexpected exceptions are not shown in the error toast. Similar to SQL Lab table and schema errors, this adds the sanitized error message to the Explore error toast if available.\r\n- `BaseEngineSpec` was missing `get_dbapi_mapped_exception` in many methods that potentially raised database-specific exceptions - these are added here + exception chaining as recommended [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#exception-chaining).\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nWhen trying to Explore a dataset that has an error, the toast now shows the error message:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/198996047-cac67b7d-6c47-4a97-b40a-64f1b64f4398.png)\r\n\r\nError messages are also surfaced in SQL Lab when fetching schemas/tables:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/198996100-c4ae72c9-ec14-4832-a115-c53b6948b8f5.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nOn Explore, a generic uninformative error was toasted:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/198996145-8d9db079-1892-4c7e-9e50-b5c1bc6f71d8.png)\r\n\r\nIn SQL Lab, previously the table error message wasn't always raised, and no error context was available for either schema or table error toasts:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/198996180-48d97dbd-1ea8-4a5c-bbc7-171abfb25191.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIn native filter, every time we switch the filter, we will reset the activeKey of the collapsing panel (control behavior), which will lead to some unnecessary rendering, but in fact we just need to set the default value and let the component control itself (uncontrol behavior)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!---

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n**Background**: Currently the forecasting feature requires using a temporal x-axis. The majority of the advanced analytics controls are also currently specific to temporal x-axis, so they will need to be hidden when a non-temporal x-axis is selected.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Currently only dynamic control is supported, but not section-level.  So this pr adds the ability to allows a section to be displayed dynamically and reset the value when hidden.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### after\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/198889737-93f5cc59-baee-4e68-ae80-dd4ddb5942cd.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nFollowup to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21627\r\nIn order to be able to log celery errors and warnings separately, I am focusing on report errors for both slack and email and raising either a ReportScheduleClientErrorsException or ReportScheduleSystemErrorsException and then logging according to the status code of each (4xx or 500). \r\nFor slack errors, I am also catching each error from the slack api and raising an appropriate http status code, which then helps to inform the logging level for celery.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR updates native filter dividers to display correctly when native filters are rendered as a horizontal bar, which will be supported in a future PR.  In this PR, the divider is factored out into its own component, `FilterDivider`, which now supports three view modes:\r\n- **Vertical**: Same as current; displays full title and full description, if set.\r\n- **Horizontal**: Displays title, subject to truncation.  If title is truncated or if there is a description set, an icon appears with a tooltip showing the full title (if truncated) and/or the description (if set).\r\n- **Horizontal overflow**: Displays title and description, if set, both subject to truncation.  Hovering over truncated description or title will show full text.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nVertical (same as before):\r\n<img width=\"315\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-28 at 4 27 49 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/198752602-9d62db8a-074f-4d34-871a-9ca313eb79a7.png\">\r\n\r\nHorizontal:\r\n<img width=\"348\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-28 at 4 27 59 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/198752611-0d303a78-60bd-49f6-a47b-acae3b8fccde.png\">\r\n<img width=\"310\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-28 at 4 28 09 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/198752616-04943b0a-cb4d-4e41-a196-7829c2b83b7f.png\">\r\n<img width=\"263\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-28 at 4 28 26 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/198752618-e9ad4221-4453-4ebf-bd57-113139267d5a.png\">\r\n<img width=\"285\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-28 at 4 28 37 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/198752622-db2decc9-87bc-4f01-89d7-1e8b4d280e33.png\">\r\n\r\nHorizontal overflow:\r\n<img width=\"314\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-28 at 4 28 44 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/198752631-1dbdc499-dc79-49b4-b4a2-14a35bf35c79.png\">\r\n<img width=\"277\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-28 at 4 28 56 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/198752633-ecacd0ef-05c7-4b1c-a22e-ec61a1ac65e8.png\">\r\n<img width=\"314\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-28 at 4 29 10 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/198752644-811004aa-e5ec-4d35-8754-327416220bc1.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis commit fixes the regression from #21937\r\nThere's [a known issue](https://github.com/sidorares/json-bigint/issues/74#issuecomment-1284992714) for floating value formatting on current latest version of `json-bigint` open source.\r\n\r\nSince the main contributor no longer maintain the new release, this commit replaces the open-source library by `json-bigint-native` which is branched out from `json-bigint@1.0.0 (latest version)` and fixes the known bugs including float value issue.\r\nThis commit also adds the extra specs to verify the floating value formatting.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore: (returns NaN

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR implements 2 improvements to the releasing of Helm chart:\r\n- Support for running [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) to generate a README for the chart, automatically generated from the `Chart.yaml` and annotated `values.yaml`. It will be enforced both as a `pre-commit` check, as well as a CI check.\r\n- Fix the helm `chart-releaser` action which seems broken due to missing dependency on the bitnami chart repo (which prevented the release of the updated chart from #21806 ) - this may need some trial & error to confirm a successful release.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a (useless) bump of the chart version to force the CI to go through a Helm release.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nSee [generated Chart](https://github.com/one-acre-fund/superset/tree/helm-docs/helm/superset) `README`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59641363/198537267-8c4c6a1b-92f8-4ac3-b4c8-d8b839b65eb6.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n- For the `helm-docs` pre-commit:\r\n  - Check out project\r\n  - Update pre-commit (`pre-commit install`)\r\n  - Make some chart update (e.g. bump up the version in `Chart.yaml`) and stage the change\r\n  - Try to commit. Git should raise an error complaining that a pre-commit check has failed\r\n  - Run `pre-commit run helm-docs` to force execute the helm-docs generation, stage the resulting change and commit again\r\n- For the chart releaser fix: merge the PR and hope for helm chart v0.7.6 to be released!\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: #21806 (merge failed to release)\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-28T08:07:49Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:40:11Z","closed_at":"2022-10-29T23:29:54Z","merged_at":"2022-10-29T23:29:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae9a30b37cbed73101b93d660a32940f266c0075","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6575674535,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABh_DUpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.1.0","name":"🚢

Externalized code referencing <code>React.useInsertionEffect</code> to a separate <code>@emotion/use-insertion-effect-with-fallbacks</code> package. This package should be used in your defined externals if you bundle Emotion for whatever reason. It references <code>useInsertionEffect</code> in a very specific way that allows us to use it conditionally. However, if the code consuming Emotion is bundled as a library with Emotion in it then some bundlers might change the way in which we reference <code>useInsertionEffect</code> and that might create problems for bundlers used to consume the said library code. By externalizing this new package you can still bundle Emotion if you want to without running into this problem as you won't &quot;destroy&quot; the carefully crafted reference to <code>useInsertionEffect</code> in the process.</p>\n<p>Note that we don't recommend bundling Emotion. You should have very specific reasons to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updated dependencies [<a href=\"https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/89b6dbb3c13d49ef1fa3d88888672d810853f05a\"><code>89b6dbb3</code></a>]:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>@​emotion/use-insertion-effect-with-fallbacks</code><a href=\"https://github.com/1\"><code>@​1</code></a>.0.0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><code>@​emotion/react</code><a href=\"https://github.com/11\"><code>@​11</code></a>.10.0</h2>\n<h3>Minor Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/emotion-js/emotion/pull/2819\">#2819</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/commit/bbad8c79937f8dfd5d93bf485c1e9ec44124d228\"><code>bbad8c79</code></a> Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/nicksrandall\"><code>@​nicksrandall</code></a>! - <code>exports</code> field has been added to the <code>package.json</code> manifest.
