What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22932 .\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark writes Spark version number into Hive Table properties with `spark.sql.create.version`.\r\n```\r\nparameters:{\r\n  spark.sql.sources.schema.part.0={\r\n    \"type\":\"struct\",\r\n    \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"a\",\"type\":\"integer\",\"nullable\":true,\"metadata\":{}}]\r\n  },\r\n  transient_lastDdlTime=1541142761,\r\n  spark.sql.sources.schema.numParts=1,\r\n  spark.sql.create.version=2.4.0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to write Spark versions to ORC/Parquet file metadata with `org.apache.spark.sql.create.version` because we used `org.apache.` prefix in Parquet metadata already. It's different from Hive Table property key `spark.sql.create.version`, but it seems that we cannot change Hive Table property for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, ORC and Parquet file generated by Spark will have the following metadata.\r\n\r\n**ORC (`native` and `hive` implmentation)**\r\n```\r\n$ orc-tools meta /tmp/o\r\nFile Version: 0.12 with ...\r\n...\r\nUser Metadata:\r\n  org.apache.spark.sql.create.version=3.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**PARQUET**\r\n```\r\n$ parquet-tools meta /tmp/p\r\n...\r\ncreator:     parquet-mr version 1.10.0 (build 031a6654009e3b82020012a18434c582bd74c73a)\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.sql.create.version = 3.0.0\r\nextra:       org.apache.spark.sql.parquet.row.metadata =

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a new parquet/avro file metadata: `org.apache.spark.legacyDatetime`. It indicates that the file was written with the \"rebaseInWrite\" config enabled, and spark need to do rebase when reading it.\r\n\r\nThis makes Spark be able to do rebase more smartly:\r\n1. If we don't know which Spark version writes the file, do rebase if the \"rebaseInRead\" config is true. \r\n2. If the file was written by Spark 2.4 and earlier, then do rebase.\r\n3. If the file was written by Spark 3.0 and later, do rebase if the `org.apache.spark.legacyDatetime` exists in file metadata.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's very easy to have mixed-calendar parquet/avro files: e.g. A user upgrades to Spark 3.0 and writes some parquet files to an existing directory. Then he realizes that the directory contains legacy datetime values before 1582. However, it's too late and he has to find out all the legacy files manually and read them separately.\r\n\r\nTo support mixed-calendar parquet/avro files, we need to decide to rebase or not based on the file metadata.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated

Run a job with shuffle.\r\n`scala> sc.parallelize(1 to 10).map(x => (x, x)).reduceByKey(_ + _).collect`\r\n\r\n2. Visit StagePage for the stage writing shuffle data and check `Shuffle Write Time`.\r\n<img width=\"401\" alt=\"check-shuffle-write-time\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/78557730-4513e200-784c-11ea-8b42-a5053b9489a5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Run a job with no shuffle.\r\n`scala> sc.parallelize(1 to 10).collect`\r\n\r\n4. Visit StagePage for the last stage.\r\n<img width=\"956\" alt=\"hungup\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/78557746-4f35e080-784c-11ea-83e8-5db745b88535.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue is caused by following reason.\r\n\r\nIn stagepage.js, an array `optionalColumns` has indices for columns for optional metrics.\r\nIf a stage doesn't perform shuffle read or write, the corresponding indices are removed from the array.\r\nStagePage doesn't try to create column for such metrics, even if the state of corresponding optional metrics are preserved as \"visible\".\r\nBut, if a stage doesn't perform both shuffle read and write, the index for `Shuffle Write Time` isn't removed.\r\nIn that case, StagePage tries to create a column for `Shuffle Write Time` even though there are no metrics for shuffle write, leading hungup.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI tested with operations I explained above and confirmed that StagePage won't be hung-up.","created_at":"2020-04-06T12:21:27Z","updated_at":"2020-04-06T19:38:26Z","closed_at":"2020-04-06T19:38:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdbb61f5e10b67fb3c7fb6f3ce919a6fa65b037d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to improve the error message from Scalar iterator pandas UDF.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo show the correct error messages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but only in unreleased branches.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, PandasUDFType\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf('long', PandasUDFType.SCALAR_ITER)\r\ndef pandas_plus_one(iterator):\r\n      for _ in iterator:\r\n            yield pd.Series(1)\r\n\r\nspark.range(10).repartition(1).select(pandas_plus_one(\"id\")).show()\r\n```\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf,

iterator UDF should \r\nbe the same with input rows. The input rows number is 10 but the output \r\nrows number is 1.\r\n```\r\n```\r\nAssertionError: Pandas MAP_ITER UDF outputted more rows than input rows.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nRuntimeError: The length of output in Scalar iterator pandas UDF should be \r\nthe same with the input's; however, the length of output was 1 and the length \r\nof input was 10.\r\n```\r\n```\r\nAssertionError: Pandas SCALAR_ITER UDF outputted more rows than input rows.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were fixed accordingly.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-06T08:41:05Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:44:58Z","closed_at":"2020-04-09T04:14:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b76b36a0010d0c343c7a08e25629fe601f410cdf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6309034703fd7b342e65ad0e936c9366a89e6c21","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-26412-followup","ref":"SPARK-26412-followup","sha":"6309034703fd7b342e65ad0e936c9366a89e6c21","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPR introduces overloaded methods for\r\n* `stat.approxQuantile`\r\n* `stat.corr`\r\n* `stat.cov`\r\n* `stat.crosstab`\r\n* `stat.freqItems`\r\n\r\nto work with arguments passed as `Column`s rather than column names.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSome other functions from `StatFunctions` module already provide `Column`-based versions, namely:\r\n* `stat.bloomFilter`\r\n* `stat.countMinSketch`\r\n* `stat.sampleBy`\r\n\r\nThe change proposed allows more flexible usage patterns along side with API consistency.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, new signatures for stat API functions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCorresponding test cases are included.\r\n\r\n### Thoughts\r\n\r\n* Python and R API should probably also be revisited (I can do this in separate PR or include here)\r\n* `stat.freqItems` with `Array` argument is overloaded, but `stat.freqItems` with Scala-only `Seq` API could not be overloaded to provide same functionality (because of type erasure)\r\n* I decided to keep old versions of helper functions from `StatFunctions`, e.g. `pearsonCorrelation` and add new `pearsonCorrelationByColumn` (it seems like API is internal but it's public and removal of public method might introduce issues)\r\n* `resolveColumn` helper introduces for `StatFunctions` should probably be the part of `Dataset` API (e.g. `Dataset.drop` uses quite the same approach when dealing with `Column` arguments), should I move it in this PR or create another one (don't want to put to many changes in a single bucket)?","created_at":"2020-04-06T01:21:37Z","updated_at":"2020-07-24T00:32:35Z","closed_at":"2020-07-24T00:32:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a195db731a01972453f3ab7584277649aa78723f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c580634e16b246af621dce1abf0ed26fa8449bb2","head":{"label":"kachayev:fix-31156","ref":"fix-31156","sha":"c580634e16b246af621dce1abf0ed26fa8449bb2","user":{"login":"kachayev","id":485647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTY0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/485647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev","html_url":"https://github.com/kachayev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":244213711,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDQyMTM3MTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"kachayev/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kachayev","id":485647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NTY0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/485647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev","html_url":"https://github.com/kachayev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kachayev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kachayev/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe auto-generated alias name of built-in function `version()` is `sparkversion()`. After this PR, it is updated to `version()`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBased on our auto-generated alias name convention for the built-in functions, the alias names should be consistent with the function names. \r\n\r\nThis built-in function `version` is added in the upcoming Spark 3.0. Thus, we should fix it before the release.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Update the column name in schema if users do not specify the alias.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to set the `America/Los_Angeles` time zone in the date-time benchmarks `DateTimeBenchmark` and `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` via `withDefaultTimeZone(LA)` and `withSQLConf(SQLConf.SESSION_LOCAL_TIMEZONE.key -> LA.getId)`.\r\n\r\nThe results of affected benchmarks was given on an Amazon EC2 instance w/ the configuration:\r\n| Item | Description |\r\n| ---- | ----|\r\n| Region | us-west-2 (Oregon) |\r\n| Instance | r3.xlarge |\r\n| AMI | ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-20190722.1 (ami-06f2f779464715dc5) |\r\n| Java | OpenJDK8/11 |\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPerformance of date-time functions can depend on the system JVM time zone or SQL config `spark.sql.session.timeZone`. The changes allow to avoid any fluctuations of benchmarks results related to time zones, and set a reliable baseline for future optimization. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy regenerating results of DateTimeBenchmark and DateTimeRebaseBenchmark.","created_at":"2020-04-05T13:31:28Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:47:08Z","closed_at":"2020-04-06T05:21:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f00c313397582490c16179273f3ba6e9dbd06088","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f3ed1d9ce57724a90aa86b8d9ee4a011976ba0a4","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:set-timezone-in-benchmarks","ref":"set-timezone-in-benchmarks","sha":"f3ed1d9ce57724a90aa86b8d9ee4a011976ba0a4","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to optimise the `DateTimeUtils`.`rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` and `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` functions, and make them faster by using pre-calculated rebasing tables. This approach allows to avoid expensive conversions via local timestamps. For example, the `America/Los_Angeles` time zone has just a few time points when difference between Proleptic Gregorian calendar and the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian since 1582-10-15) is changed in the time interval 0001-01-01 .. 2100-01-01:\r\n\r\n| i | local  timestamp | Proleptic Greg. seconds | Hybrid (Julian+Greg) seconds | difference in minutes| \r\n| -- | ------- |----|----| ---- |\r\n|0|0001-01-01 00:00|-62135568422|-62135740800|-2872|\r\n|1|0100-03-01 00:00|-59006333222|-59006419200|-1432|\r\n|...|...|...|...|...|\r\n|13|1582-10-15 00:00|-12219264422|-12219264000|7|\r\n|14|1883-11-18 12:00|-2717640000|-2717640000|0|\r\n\r\nThe difference in microseconds between Proleptic and hybrid calendars for any local timestamp in time intervals `[local timestamp(i), local timestamp(i+1))`, and for any microseconds in the time interval `[Gregorian micros(i), Gregorian micros(i+1))` is the same. In this way, we can rebase an input micros by following the steps:\r\n1. Look at the table, and find the time interval where the micros falls to\r\n2. Take the difference between 2 calendars for this time interval\r\n3. Add the difference to the input micros. The result is rebased microseconds that has the same local timestamp representation.\r\n\r\nHere are details of the implementation:\r\n- Pre-calculated tables are stored to JSON files `gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json` and `julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json` in the resource folder of `sql/catalyst`. The diffs and switch time points are stored as seconds, for example:\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"tz\" : \"America/Los_Angeles\",\r\n    \"switches\" : [ -62135740800, -59006419200, ... , -2717640000 ],\r\n    \"diffs\" : [ 172378, 85978, ..., 0 ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n  The JSON files are generated by 2 tests in `RebaseDateTimeSuite` - `generate 'gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json'` and `generate 'julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json'`. Both tests are disabled by default. \r\n  The `switches` time points are ordered from old to recent timestamps. This condition is checked by the test `validate rebase records in JSON files` in `RebaseDateTimeSuite`. Also sizes of the `switches` and `diffs` arrays are the same (this is checked by the same test).\r\n\r\n- The **_Asia/Tehran, Iran, Africa/Casablanca and Africa/El_Aaiun_** time zones weren't added to the JSON files, see [SPARK-31385](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31385)\r\n- The rebase info from the JSON files is placed to hash tables - `gregJulianRebaseMap` and `julianGregRebaseMap`. I use `AnyRefMap` because it is almost 2 times faster than Scala's immutable Map. Also I tried `java.util.HashMap` but it has worse lookup time than `AnyRefMap` in our case.\r\nThe hash maps store the switch time points and diffs in microseconds precision to avoid conversions from microseconds to seconds in the runtime.\r\n\r\n- I moved the code related to days and microseconds rebasing to the separate object `RebaseDateTime` to do not pollute `DateTimeUtils`. Tests related to date-time rebasing are moved to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` for the same reason.\r\n\r\n- I placed rebasing via local timestamp to separate methods that require zone id as the first parameter assuming that the caller has zone id already. This allows to void unnecessary retrieving the default time zone. The methods are marked as `private[sql]` because they are used in `RebaseDateTimeSuite` as reference implementation.\r\n\r\n- Modified the `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` and `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` methods in `RebaseDateTime` to look up the rebase tables first of all. If hash maps don't contain rebasing info for the given time zone id, the methods falls back to the implementation via local timestamps. This allows to support time zones specified as zone offsets like '-08:00'.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make timestamps rebasing faster:\r\n- Saving timestamps to parquet files is ~ **x3.8 faster**\r\n- Loading timestamps from parquet files is ~**x2.8 faster**.\r\n- Loading timestamps by Vectorized reader ~**x4.6 faster**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added the test `validate rebase records in JSON files` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite`. The test validates 2 json files from the resource folder - `gregorian-julian-rebase-micros.json` and `julian-gregorian-rebase-micros.json`, and it checks per each time zone records that\r\n  - the number of switch points is equal to the number of diffs between calendars. If the numbers are different, this will violate the assumption made in `RebaseDateTime.rebaseMicros`.\r\n  - swith points are ordered from old to recent timestamps. This pre-condition is required for linear search in the `rebaseMicros` function.\r\n- Added the test `optimization of micros rebasing - Gregorian to Julian` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` which iterates over timestamps from 0001-01-01 to 2100-01-01 with the steps 1 ± 0.5 months, and checks that optimised function `RebaseDateTime`.`rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` returns the same result as non-optimised one. The check is performed for the UTC, PST, CET, Africa/Dakar, America/Los_Angeles, Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Hong_Kong, Europe/Amsterdam time zones.\r\n- Added the test `optimization of micros rebasing - Julian to Gregorian` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` which does similar checks as the test above but for rebasing from the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian) to Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\r\n- The tests for days rebasing are moved from `DateTimeUtilsSuite` to `RebaseDateTimeSuite` because the rebasing related code is moved from `DateTimeUtils` to the separate object `RebaseDateTime`.\r\n- Re-run `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` at the America/Los_Angeles time zone (it is set explicitly in the PR #28127):\r\n\r\n| Item | Description |\r\n| ---- | ----|\r\n| Region | us-west-2 (Oregon) |\r\n| Instance

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds some rules that will be used by Probot Auto Labeler to label PRs based on what paths they modify.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis should make it easier for committers to organize PRs, and it could also help drive downstream tooling like the PR dashboard.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe'll only be able to test it, I believe, after merging it in. Given that [the Avro project is using this same bot already](https://github.com/apache/avro/blob/master/.github/autolabeler.yml), I expect it will be straightforward to get this working.","created_at":"2020-04-03T18:06:47Z","updated_at":"2020-04-13T13:55:17Z","closed_at":"2020-04-13T01:01:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d2f929c66ad9e8dd3ce0ebae5cc75f9e40f2a2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28114/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28114/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28114/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2ddde694c13f006d8bbb66bccd015497c53283d2","head":{"label":"nchammas:SPARK-31330-auto-label-prs","ref":"SPARK-31330-auto-label-prs","sha":"2ddde694c13f006d8bbb66bccd015497c53283d2","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs I have show in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31334 's description,  same type of sql,  when one column type is different as string, catalyst can't analyze it right. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor test sql \r\n```\r\ntest(\"xxxxxxxx\") {\r\n    Seq(\r\n      (\"1\", \"3\"),\r\n      (\"2\", \"3\"),\r\n      (\"3\", \"6\"),\r\n      (\"4\", \"7\"),\r\n      (\"5\", \"9\"),\r\n      (\"6\", \"9\")\r\n    ).toDF(\"a\", \"b\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"testData\")\r\n\r\n    val x = sql(\r\n      \"\"\"\r\n        | SELECT b, sum(a) as a\r\n        | FROM testData\r\n        | GROUP BY b\r\n        | HAVING sum(a) > 3\r\n      \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n    x.explain()\r\n    x.show()\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nWhen analyze having clause's condition  by ResolveAggregateFunctions \r\n```\r\n'Filter ('sum('a) > 3)\r\n+- Aggregate [b#181], [b#181, sum(a#180) AS a#184L]\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias `testdata`\r\n      +- Project [_1#177 AS a#180, _2#178 AS b#181]\r\n         +- LocalRelation [_1#177, _2#178]\r\n```\r\nSince `a` is StringType type and then aggregation's `agg` expression is unresolved (Because Sum. checkInputDataTypes() need NumericType, but `a` is StringType),  so  ResolveAggregateFunctions won't make a change on above LogicalPlan, then `sum(a)` in Filter condition will be resolved in ResolveReference and this a will be resolved as aggregation's output column a#184 , then error happened .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix bug in analyzer\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a TRY function that evaluates an expression and handles certain types of execution errors by returning NULL.\r\nIn cases where it is preferable that queries produce NULL instead of failing when corrupt or invalid data is encountered, the TRY function may be useful especially when ANSI mode is on and the users need null-tolerant on certain columns or outputs.\r\n\r\nAnalysisExceptions will not be handled by this, typically errors handled by TRY function are: \r\n\r\n```scala\r\n* ArightmeticException - e.g. division by zero, numeric value out of range,\r\n* NumberFormatException - e.g. invalid casting,\r\n* IllegalArgumentException - e.g. invalid datetime pattern, missing format argument for string formatting,\r\n* DateTimeException - e.g. invalid datetime values\r\n* UnsupportedEncodingException - e.g. encode or decode string with invalid charset\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn most cases of ANSI mode and few scenarios of non-ANSI mode, we will fail when an expression meets invalid or corrupt data. This behavior covers the whole SQL lifecycle and outputs. This is not very flexible for users when there  are not ALL columns need to be that much strict, e.g.\r\ne.g. \r\n```sql\r\nselect\r\n cast(str1 as timestamp) as start,\r\n cast(str2 as timestamp) as end, \r\ncast(str3 as timestamp) as comment\r\nfrom ....\r\n```\r\nthe `cast(str3 as timestamp) as comment` may not be that important to fail the entire query, then we can use `try(cast(str3 as timestamp)) as comment` to make it nullable.\r\n\r\nTRY function offers a much more fine-grained way than `spark.sql.ansi.enabled`, which controls output with null or error per attribute. \r\n\r\nAlso, this function could make expression conjunctions much safer. e.g. COALESCE \r\n\r\nAt last, some other systems like teradata/presto have such a feature implemented.\r\n\r\nhttp://teradata.github.io/presto/docs/0.157.1-t/functions/conditional.html#try\r\nhttps://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/conditional.html\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, add a new try function support.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28022, to address three issues:\r\n1. Add an assert in `CustomShuffleReaderExec` to make sure the partitions specs are all `PartialMapperPartitionSpec` or none.\r\n2. Do not use `lazy val` for `partitionDataSizeMetrics` and `skewedPartitionMetrics`, as they will be merged into `metrics`, and `lazy val` will be serialized.\r\n3. mark `metrics` as `transient`, as it's only used at driver-side\r\n4. move `FileUtils.byteCountToDisplaySize` to `logDebug`, to save some calculation if log level is above debug.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Fix the `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` function in `DateTimeUtils` by passing the daylight saving offset associated with the input `micros` to the constructed instance of `GregorianCalendar`. The problem is in `cal.getTimeInMillis` which returns earliest instant in the case of local date-time overlaps, see https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u/blob/master/jdk/src/share/classes/java/util/GregorianCalendar.java#L2783-L2786 . I fixed the issue by keeping the standard zone offset as is, and set the DST offset only. I don't set `ZONE_OFFSET` because time zone resolution works differently in Java 8 and Java 7 time APIs. So, if I would set the standard zone offsets too, this could change the behavior, and rebasing won't give the same result as Spark 2.4.\r\n2. Fix `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` by changing resulted zoned date-time if `DST_OFFSET` is zero which means the input date-time has passed an autumn daylight savings cutover. So, I take the latest local timestamp out of 2 overlapped timestamps. Otherwise I return a zoned date-time w/o any modification because it is equal to calling the `withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()` method, so, we can optimize the case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the bug of loosing of DST offset info in rebasing timestamps via local date-time. For example, there are 2 different timestamps in the `America/Los_Angeles` time zone: `2019-11-03T01:00:00-07:00` and `2019-11-03T01:00:00-08:00`, though they are mapped to the same local date-time `2019-11-03T01:00`, see\r\n<img width=\"456\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-04-02 at 10 19 24\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1580697/78245697-95a7da00-74f0-11ea-9eba-c08138851cb3.png\">\r\nCurrently, the UTC timestamp `2019-11-03T09:00:00Z` is converted to `2019-11-03T01:00:00-08:00`, and then to `2019-11-03T01:00:00` (in the original calendar, for instance Proleptic Gregorian calendar) and back to the UTC timestamp `2019-11-03T08:00:00Z` (in the hybrid calendar - Gregorian for the timestamp). That's wrong because the local timestamp must be converted to the original timestamp `2019-11-03T09:00:00Z`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added a test to `DateTimeUtilsSuite` which checks that rebased micros are the same as the input during DST. The result must be the same if Java 8 and 7 time API functions return the same time zone offsets.\r\n- Run the following code to check that there is no difference between rebased and original micros for modern timestamps:\r\n```scala\r\n    test(\"rebasing differences\") {\r\n      withDefaultTimeZone(getZoneId(\"America/Los_Angeles\")) {\r\n        val start = instantToMicros(LocalDateTime.of(1,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackendSuite.RegisterExecutor`, change it to post `SparkListenerExecutorAdded` before `context.reply(true)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo fix flaky `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackendSuite.custom log url for Spark UI is applied`.\r\n\r\nIn this test, though we use `askSync` to register executor but `askSync` could be finished before we posting the 3rd `SparkListenerExecutorAdded` event to the listener bus due to the reason that `context.reply(true)` comes before `listenerBus.post`.\r\n\r\nThe error can be reproduced if you:\r\n- loop it for 500 times in one turn\r\n- or, insert a `Thread.sleep(1000)` between `post` and `reply`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR intends to add a new SQL config for controlling a plan explain mode in the events of (e.g., `SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart` and `SparkListenerSQLAdaptiveExecutionUpdate`) SQL listeners. In the current master, the output of `QueryExecution.toString` (this is equivalent to the \"extended\" explain mode) is stored in these events. I think it is useful to control the content via `SQLConf`. For example, the query \"Details\" content (TPCDS q66 query) of a SQL tab in a Spark web UI will be changed as follows;\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n![q66-extended](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/692303/78211668-950b4580-74e8-11ea-90c6-db52d437534b.png)\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n![q66-formatted](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/692303/78211674-9ccaea00-74e8-11ea-9d1d-43c7e2b0f314.png)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better usability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes; since Spark 3.1, SQL UI data adopts the `formatted` mode for the query plan explain results. To restore the behavior before Spark 3.0, you can set `spark.sql.ui.explainMode` to `extended`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2020-04-02T04:51:25Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T02:27:42Z","closed_at":"2020-04-03T04:09:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e319c51529058ba663ac1c1a9192c8ce7d304a99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR (SPARK-31324) aims to include stream ID in the error thrown when a stream does not stop() in time. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26771/ added a conf to set a requested timeout for stopping a stream, after which the stop() method throws. From seeing this in a production use case with several streams running, it's helpful to include which stream failed to stop in the error message.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIf a stream times out when terminating, the error message now includes the stream ID.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n`Stream Execution thread failed to stop within 2000 milliseconds (specified by spark.sql.streaming.stopTimeout). See the cause on what was being executed in the streaming query thread.`\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n`Stream Execution thread for stream [id = 8513769d-b9d2-4902-9b36-3668bd022245, runId = 21ed8c35-9bfe-423f-853d-c022d91818bc] failed to stop within 2000 milliseconds (specified by spark.sql.streaming.stopTimeout).

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis adds UI updates to support stage level scheduling and ResourceProfiles. 3 main things have been added. ResourceProfile id added to the Stage page, the Executors page now has an optional selectable column to show the ResourceProfile Id of each executor, and the Environment page now has a section with the ResourceProfile ids.  Along with this the rest api for environment page was updated to include the Resource profile information.\r\n\r\nI debating on splitting the resource profile information into its own page but I wasn't sure it called for a completely separate page. Open to peoples thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nScreen shots:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-01 at 3 07 46 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4563792/78185169-469a7000-7430-11ea-8b0c-d9ede2d41df8.png)\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-01 at 3 08 14 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4563792/78185175-48fcca00-7430-11ea-8d1d-6b9333700f32.png)\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-01 at 3 09 03 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4563792/78185176-4a2df700-7430-11ea-92d9-73c382bb0f32.png)\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-04-01 at 11 05 48 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4563792/78185186-4dc17e00-7430-11ea-8962-f749dd47ea60.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nrename `QueryPlan.collectInPlanAndSubqueries` to `collectWithSubqueries`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe old name is too verbose. `QueryPlan` is internal but it's the core of catalyst and we'd better make the API name clearer before we release it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `SaveMode` is resolved before we create `FileWriteBuilder` to build `BatchWrite`.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25876, we removed save mode for DSV2 from DataFrameWriter. So that the `mode` method is never used which makes `validateInputs` fail determinately without `mode` set.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nrm dead code. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to cache Class instance for the UDF instance in HiveFunctionWrapper to fix the case where Hive simple UDF is somehow transformed (expression is copied) and evaluated later with another classloader (for the case current thread context classloader is somehow changed). In this case, Spark throws CNFE as of now.\r\n\r\nIt's only occurred for Hive simple UDF, as HiveFunctionWrapper caches the UDF instance whereas it doesn't do for `UDF` type. The comment says Spark has to create instance every time for UDF, so we cannot simply do the same. This patch caches Class instance instead, and switch current thread context classloader to which loads the Class instance.\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the test boundary as well. We only tested with GenericUDTF for SPARK-26560, and this patch actually requires only UDF. But to avoid regression for other types as well, this patch adds all available types (UDF, GenericUDF, AbstractGenericUDAFResolver, UDAF, GenericUDTF) into the boundary of tests.\r\n\r\nCredit to @cloud-fan as he discovered the problem and proposed the solution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAbove section describes why it's a bug and how it's fixed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs added.","created_at":"2020-03-31T23:40:37Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T03:54:10Z","closed_at":"2020-04-01T03:39:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2defd64806382c8bf3a0683777a94c37f329203","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28086/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28086/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28086/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb42ff155f220cdf8bb391160d51257bd231b222","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-31312-branch-2.4","ref":"SPARK-31312-branch-2.4","sha":"eb42ff155f220cdf8bb391160d51257bd231b222","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs part of the Stage level scheduling features, add the Python api's to set resource profiles.\r\nThis also adds the functionality to properly apply the pyspark memory configuration when specified in the ResourceProfile. The pyspark memory configuration is being passed in the task local properties. This was an easy way to get it to the PythonRunner that needs it. I modeled this off how the barrier task scheduling is passing the addresses. As part of this I added in the JavaRDD api's because those are needed by python.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\npython api for this feature\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes adds the java and python apis for user to specify a ResourceProfile to use stage level scheduling.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nunit tests and manually tested on yarn. Tests also run to verify it errors properly on standalone and local mode where its not yet supported.","created_at":"2020-03-31T20:05:29Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T01:20:48Z","closed_at":"2020-04-23T01:20:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e39a71ae034375219a7ddfbc6e081b5ffbfc514e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28085/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28085/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28085/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/354fb0c09ff9ed6be985f0ca7a8b6fae835303a2","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-29641-pr-base","ref":"SPARK-29641-pr-base","sha":"354fb0c09ff9ed6be985f0ca7a8b6fae835303a2","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-21870 (cb0cddf#diff-06dc5de6163687b7810aa76e7e152a76R146-R149) caused significant performance regression in cases where the source code size is fairly large as `HashAggregateExec` uses `Block.length` to decide on splitting the code. The change in `length` makes sense as the comment and extra new lines shouldn't be taken into account when deciding on splitting, but the regular expression based approach is very slow and adds a big relative overhead to cases where the execution is quick (small number of rows).\r\nThis PR:\r\n- restores `Block.length` to its original form\r\n- places comments in `HashAggragateExec` with `CodegenContext.registerComment` so as to appear only when comments are enabled (`spark.sql.codegen.comments=true`)\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\ndeeply nested struct field r/w:           Best

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace the following SQL configs:\r\n1.  `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.rebaseDateTime.enabled` by\r\n    - `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.rebaseDateTimeInWrite.enabled` (`false` by default). The config enables rebasing dates/timestamps while saving to Parquet files. If it is set to `true`, dates/timestamps are converted to local date-time in Proleptic Gregorian calendar, date-time fields are extracted, and used in building new local date-time in the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian). The resulted local date-time is converted to days or microseconds since the epoch.\r\n    - `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.rebaseDateTimeInRead.enabled` (`false` by default). The config enables rebasing of dates/timestamps in reading from Parquet files.\r\n2. `spark.sql.legacy.avro.rebaseDateTime.enabled` by\r\n    - `spark.sql.legacy.avro.rebaseDateTimeInWrite.enabled` (`false` by default). It enables dates/timestamps rebasing from Proleptic Gregorian calendar to the hybrid calendar via local date/timestamps.\r\n    - `spark.sql.legacy.avro.rebaseDateTimeInRead.enabled` (`false` by default).  It enables rebasing dates/timestamps from the hybrid calendar to Proleptic Gregorian calendar in read. The rebasing is performed by converting micros/millis/days to a local date/timestamp in the source calendar, interpreting the resulted date/timestamp in the target calendar, and getting the number of micros/millis/days since the epoch 1970-01-01 00:00:00Z.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis allows to load dates/timestamps saved by Spark 2.4, and save to Parquet/Avro files without rebasing. And the reverse use case - load data saved by Spark 3.0, and save it in the form which is compatible with Spark 2.4.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, users have to use new SQL configs. Old SQL configs are removed by the PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites `AvroV1Suite`, `AvroV2Suite` and `ParquetIOSuite`.","created_at":"2020-03-31T11:52:19Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:55Z","closed_at":"2020-04-01T04:56:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1698349f125ca46b0151b99f91d86d426f90a0ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28082/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28082/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28082/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b15982d4dd3e697d5ebea598e8976c6dd2072dc0","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:split-rebase-configs","ref":"split-rebase-configs","sha":"b15982d4dd3e697d5ebea598e8976c6dd2072dc0","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter my investigation, `SQLQueryTestSuite` spent a lot of time compiling the generated java code.\r\nTake `group-by.sql` as an example.\r\nAt first, I added some debug log into `SQLQueryTestSuite`.\r\nPlease reference https://github.com/beliefer/spark/blob/92b6af740c73e33007c21592023eb65635bb0f07/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SQLQueryTestSuite.scala#L402\r\nThe execution command is as follows:\r\n`build/sbt \"~sql/test-only *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z group-by.sql\"`\r\nThe output show below:\r\n```\r\n00:56:06.192 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite: group-by.sql using configs: spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=true. run time: 20604\r\n00:56:13.719 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite: group-by.sql using configs: spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false,spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=CODEGEN_ONLY. run time: 7526\r\n00:56:18.786 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite: group-by.sql using configs: spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false,spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=NO_CODEGEN. run time: 5066\r\n```\r\nAccording to the log, we know.\r\n\r\nConfig | Run time(ms)\r\n-- | --\r\nspark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=true | 20604\r\nspark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false,spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=CODEGEN_ONLY | 7526\r\nspark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false,spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=NO_CODEGEN | 5066\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should display the total compile time for generated java code.\r\n\r\nThis PR will add the following to `SQLQueryTestSuite`'s output.\r\n```\r\n=== Metrics of Whole Codegen ===\r\nTotal compile time: 80.564516529 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: At first, I wanted to use `CodegenMetrics.METRIC_COMPILATION_TIME` to do this. After many experiments, I found that `CodegenMetrics.METRIC_COMPILATION_TIME` is only effective for a single test case, and cannot play a role in the whole life cycle of `SQLQueryTestSuite`.\r\nI checked the type of  ` CodegenMetrics.METRIC_COMPILATION_TIME` is `Histogram` and the latter preserves 1028 elements.` Histogram` is a metric which calculates the distribution of a value.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDisplay the total compile time for generated java code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-31T11:36:49Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T07:11:17Z","closed_at":"2020-04-02T09:13:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"51a2d5806e2bb98bffbcbc0681f0725c7f350d8e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eb27c3acfcfe3b5e4ac86c6720bc02a287c4f584","head":{"label":"beliefer:output-codegen-compile-time","ref":"output-codegen-compile-time","sha":"eb27c3acfcfe3b5e4ac86c6720bc02a287c4f584","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to cache Class instance for the UDF instance in HiveFunctionWrapper to fix the case where Hive simple UDF is somehow transformed (expression is copied) and evaluated later with another classloader (for the case current thread context classloader is somehow changed). In this case, Spark throws CNFE as of now.\r\n\r\nIt's only occurred for Hive simple UDF, as HiveFunctionWrapper caches the UDF instance whereas it doesn't do for `UDF` type. The comment says Spark has to create instance every time for UDF, so we cannot simply do the same. This patch caches Class instance instead, and switch current thread context classloader to which loads the Class instance.\r\n\r\nThis patch extends the test boundary as well. We only tested with GenericUDTF for SPARK-26560, and this patch actually requires only UDF. But to avoid regression for other types as well, this patch adds all available types (UDF, GenericUDF, AbstractGenericUDAFResolver, UDAF, GenericUDTF) into the boundary of tests.\r\n\r\nCredit to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR (SPARK-31308) proposed to add python dependencies even it is not Python applications.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor now, we add `pyFiles` argument to `files` argument only for Python applications, in SparkSubmit. Like the reason in #21420, \"for some Spark applications, though they're a java program, they require not only jar dependencies, but also python dependencies.\", we need to add `pyFiles` to `files` even it is not Python applications.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. After this change, for non-PySpark applications, the Python files specified by `pyFiles` are also added to `files` like PySpark applications.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually test on jupyter notebook or do `spark-submit` with `--verbose`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSpark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new benchmarks to `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` for saving and loading dates/timestamps to/from ORC files. I extracted common code from the benchmark for Parquet datasource and place it to the methods `caseName()` and `getPath()`. Added benchmarks for ORC save/load dates before and after 1582-10-15 because an implementation may have different performance for dates before the Julian calendar cutover day, see #28067 as an example.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo have the base line for future optimizations of `fromJavaDate()`/`toJavaDate()` and `toJavaTimestamp()`/`fromJavaTimestamp()` in `DateTimeUtils`. The methods are used while saving/loading dates/timestamps by ORC datasource.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the updated benchmark `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` via the command:\r\n```\r\nSPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/test:runMain org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.DateTimeRebaseBenchmark\"\r\n```\r\nin the environment:\r\n\r\n| Item | Description |\r\n| ---- | ----|\r\n| Region | us-west-2 (Oregon) |\r\n| Instance |

shuffle temporary eagerly. This is helpful for not to fail the entire task in the scenario of occasional disk failure. But for the applications that many tasks don't actually create shuffle files, it caused overhead.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA small documentation change to clarify that the `rand()` function produces values in `[0.0, 1.0)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`rand()` uses `Rand()` - which generates values in [0, 1) ([documented here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a1dbcd13a3eeaee50cc1a46e909f9478d6d55177/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/randomExpressions.scala#L71)). The existing documentation suggests that 1.0 is a possible value returned by rand (i.e for a distribution written as `X ~ U(a, b)`, x can be a or b, so `U[0.0, 1.0]` suggests the value returned could include 1.0).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nOnly documentation changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nDocumentation changes only.","created_at":"2020-03-30T10:44:36Z","updated_at":"2020-03-31T06:17:32Z","closed_at":"2020-03-31T06:16:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5df23b9a8c239f266e50de3d583d3ab0626e57b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28071/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28071/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28071/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5768671f4e6f33b4bd6a21ea586657d78fcb8b86","head":{"label":"Smeb:master","ref":"master","sha":"5768671f4e6f33b4bd6a21ea586657d78fcb8b86","user":{"login":"Smeb","id":10359306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzU5MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10359306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb","html_url":"https://github.com/Smeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251272746,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNzI3NDY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Smeb/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Smeb","id":10359306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzU5MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10359306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb","html_url":"https://github.com/Smeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Smeb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Smeb/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace current implementation of the `rebaseGregorianToJulianDays()` and `rebaseJulianToGregorianDays()` functions in `DateTimeUtils` by new one which is based on the fact that difference between Proleptic Gregorian and the hybrid (Julian+Gregorian) calendars was changed only 14 times for entire supported range of valid dates `[0001-01-01, 9999-12-31]`:\r\n\r\n| date | Proleptic Greg. days | Hybrid (Julian+Greg) days | diff| \r\n| ---- | ----|----|----|\r\n|0001-01-01|-719162|-719164|-2|\r\n|0100-03-01|-682944|-682945|-1|\r\n|0200-03-01|-646420|-646420|0|\r\n|0300-03-01|-609896|-609895|1|\r\n|0500-03-01|-536847|-536845|2|\r\n|0600-03-01|-500323|-500320|3|\r\n|0700-03-01|-463799|-463795|4|\r\n|0900-03-01|-390750|-390745|5|\r\n|1000-03-01|-354226|-354220|6|\r\n|1100-03-01|-317702|-317695|7|\r\n|1300-03-01|-244653|-244645|8|\r\n|1400-03-01|-208129|-208120|9|\r\n|1500-03-01|-171605|-171595|10|\r\n|1582-10-15|-141427|-141427|0|\r\n\r\nFor the given days since the epoch, the proposed implementation finds the range of days which the input days belongs to, and adds the diff in days between calendars to the input. The result is rebased days since the epoch in the target calendar. \r\n\r\nFor example, if need to rebase -650000 days from Proleptic Gregorian calendar to the hybrid calendar. In that case, the input falls to the bucket [-682944, -646420), the diff associated with the range is -1. To get the rebased days in Julian calendar, we should add -1 to -650000, and the result is -650001.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make dates rebasing faster.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo, the results should be the same for valid range of the `DATE` type `[0001-01-01, 9999-12-31]`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added 2 tests to `DateTimeUtilsSuite` for the `rebaseGregorianToJulianDays()` and `rebaseJulianToGregorianDays()` functions. The tests check that results of old and new implementation (optimized version) are the same for all supported dates.\r\n- Re-run `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` on:\r\n\r\n| Item | Description |\r\n| ---- |

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR replaces the method calls of `toSet.toSeq` with `distinct`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`toSet.toSeq` is intended to make its elements unique but a bit verbose. Using `distinct` instead is easier to understand and improves readability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nTested with the existing unit tests and found no problem.","created_at":"2020-03-28T13:35:13Z","updated_at":"2020-03-29T00:27:02Z","closed_at":"2020-03-28T23:48:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b35bcdb69579a1be4e5efb60a2ee1ba5816efd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92f871bd84be41deed018896e74348e58e2c3b79","head":{"label":"sekikn:SPARK-31292","ref":"SPARK-31292","sha":"92f871bd84be41deed018896e74348e58e2c3b79","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":92109874,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MjEwOTg3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sekikn/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new benchmark `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` which should measure the performance of rebasing of dates/timestamps from/to to the hybrid calendar (Julian+Gregorian) to/from Proleptic Gregorian calendar:\r\n1. In write, it saves separately dates and timestamps before and after 1582 year w/ and w/o rebasing.\r\n2. In read, it loads previously saved parquet files by vectorized reader and by regular reader.\r\n\r\nHere is the summary of benchmarking:\r\n- Saving timestamps is **~6 times slower**\r\n- Loading timestamps w/ vectorized **off** is **~4 times slower**\r\n- Loading timestamps w/ vectorized **on** is **~10 times slower**\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo know the impact of date-time rebasing introduced by #27915, #27953, #27807.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRun the `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` benchmark

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor the stage level scheduling feature, add the ability to optionally merged resource profiles if they were specified on multiple RDD within a stage.  There is a config to enable this feature, its off by default (spark.scheduler.resourceProfile.mergeConflicts). When the config is set to true, Spark will merge the profiles selecting the max value of each resource (cores, memory, gpu, etc).  further documentation will be added with SPARK-30322.\r\n\r\nThis also added in the ability to check if an equivalent resource profile already exists. This is so that if a user is running stages and combining the same profiles over and over again we don't get an explosion in the number of profiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo allow users to specify resource on multiple RDD and not worry as much about if they go into the same stage and fail. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, when the config is turned on it now merges the profiles instead of errorring out.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make pandas function APIs (`groupby.(cogroup.)applyInPandas` and `mapInPandas`) to ignore Python type hints.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPython type hints are optional. It shouldn't affect where pandas UDFs are not used.\r\nThis is also a future work for them to support other type hints. We shouldn't at least throw an exception at this moment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's master-only change.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndef pandas_plus_one(pdf: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\r\n    return pdf + 1\r\n\r\nspark.range(10).groupby('id').applyInPandas(pandas_plus_one, schema=\"id long\").show()\r\n```\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndef pandas_plus_one(left: pd.DataFrame, right: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\r\n    return left +

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to update the doc for the `timeZone` option in JSON/CSV datasources and for the `tz` parameter of the `from_utc_timestamp()`/`to_utc_timestamp()` functions, and to restrict format of config's values to 2 forms:\r\n1. Geographical regions, such as `America/Los_Angeles`.\r\n2. Fixed offsets - a fully resolved offset from UTC. For example, `-08:00`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOther formats such as three-letter time zone IDs are ambitious, and depend on the locale. For example, `CST` could be U.S. `Central Standard Time` and `China Standard Time`. Such formats have been already deprecated in JDK, see [Three-letter time zone IDs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running `./dev/scalastyle`, and manual testing.","created_at":"2020-03-27T11:33:06Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:51Z","closed_at":"2020-03-30T04:20:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8bb673d8439b04cf9799769223ab70d591c0d8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/99ccc589ef9650f817ac2d06ab13aa1ffabff9a8","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:doc-time-zone-option","ref":"doc-time-zone-option","sha":"99ccc589ef9650f817ac2d06ab13aa1ffabff9a8","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn Pyspark/context.py, we extract the configuration of the \"spark.executorEnv\" prefix from conf and put it in env. But in PythonWorkerFactory, we have already obtained these environment variables from ProgressBuilder, thus we do not need the extra copy.\r\nIn addition, in some special environment deployments, user-configured environment variables such as \"spark.executorEnv.Path=/usr/lib:$PATH\" will be automatically parsed as actual machine confs. If we still directly copy and overwrite it, the configuration will be a wrong config.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nrun

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose 2 tests to check that rebasing of timestamps from/to the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian) to/from Proleptic Gregorian calendar works correctly.\r\n1. The test `compatibility with Spark 2.4 in reading timestamps` load ORC file saved by Spark 2.4.5 via:\r\n```shell\r\n$ export TZ=\"America/Los_Angeles\"\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"America/Los_Angeles\")\r\n\r\nscala> val df = Seq(\"1001-01-01 01:02:03.123456\").toDF(\"tsS\").select($\"tsS\".cast(\"timestamp\").as(\"ts\"))\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [ts: timestamp]\r\n\r\nscala> df.write.orc(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_ts_orc\")\r\n\r\nscala> spark.read.orc(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_ts_orc\").show(false)\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|ts                        |\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|1001-01-01 01:02:03.123456|\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n```\r\n2. The test `rebasing timestamps in write` is round trip test. Since the previous test confirms correct rebasing of timestamps in read. This test should pass only if rebasing works correctly in write.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo guarantee that rebasing works correctly for timestamps in ORC datasource.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running `OrcSourceSuite` for Hive 1.2 and 2.3 via the commands:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 \"test:testOnly *OrcSourceSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-1.2 \"test:testOnly
