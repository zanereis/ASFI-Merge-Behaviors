When an internal accumulator uses an unexpected type, it will crash.\r\n\r\nAn event log that contains such accumulator will be dropped because it cannot be converted to JSON, and it will cause weird UI issue when rendering in Spark History Server. For example, if `SparkListenerTaskEnd` is dropped because of this issue, the user will see the task is still running even if it was finished.\r\n\r\nIt's better to make `accumValueToJson` more robust because it's up to the user to pick up the accumulator name.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. Use `pa.infer_type` over `pa.Schema.from_pandas` to infer Arrow types for conversion, as it handles pandas extension types and can ignore `pd.NA` values,\r\n2. Check for the implementation of `__arrow_array__` in series' backing arrays, and if present, use it to convert pandas DataFrame columns to Arrow arrays during serialisation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes allow usage of pandas DataFrames which contain ExtensionDtype columns that are backed by arrays that implement `__arrow_array__`. DataFrames containing such columns will be returned when specifying an ExtensionDtype-extending pandas type in the `dtype` parameter when constructed, and can also be created via calling `convert_dtypes` on an existing DataFrame.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users will be able to convert a wider variety of pandas DataFrames into Spark DataFrames using any currently released pyarrow version > 0.15.1. Prior to this fix, neither the Arrow conversion path nor the fallback path would work with these DataFrames.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the check to see whether the allocated executors for the waiting application is empty before recognizing it as a possible hang application.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt's a bugfix. The warning means there are not enough resources for the application to launch at least one executor. But we can still successfully run a job under this warning, which means it does have launched executor. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, in the rule`PushPredicateThroughJoin`, if the condition predicate of `Or` operator can't be entirely pushed down, it will be thrown away.\r\nIn fact, the predicates under `Or` operators can be partially pushed down.\r\nFor example, says `a` and `b` are able to be pushed into one of the joined tables, while `c` can't be pushed down, the predicate\r\n`a or (b and c)`\r\ncan be converted as\r\n`(a or b) and (a or c)`\r\nWe can still push down `(a or b)`.\r\nWe can't push down disjunctive predicates only when one of its children is not partially convertible.\r\n\r\nThe common way is to convert the condition into conjunctive normal form(CNF), so that we can find all the predicates that can be pushed down by going over the CNF predicate.\r\nHowever, CNF conversion result can be huge, the recursive implementation can cause stack overflow on complex predicates. There were PRs for it such as #10444, #15558, #28575.\r\nThere is also non-recursive implementation: #28733 . It should be workable but this PR proposes a simpler implementation.\r\n \r\nEssentially, we just need to traverse predicate and extract the convertible sub-predicates like what we did in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24598 . There is no need to maintain the CNF result set.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove query performance. PostgreSQL, Impala and Hive support similiar feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #28730.\r\n\r\nIn `Dataset.collectAsArrowToPython`, since the code block for `serveToStream` is run in the separate thread, `withAction` finishes as soon as it starts the thread. As a result, it doesn't collect the metrics of the actual action and Query UI shows the plan graph without metrics.\r\n\r\nWe should call `serveToStream` first, then `withAction` in it.\r\n\r\nThe affected function is:\r\n\r\n- `DataFrame.toPandas()` in PySpark\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen calling toPandas, usually Query UI shows each plan node's metric:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 10, 'abc'), (2, 20, 'def')], schema=['x', 'y', 'z'])\r\n>>> df.toPandas()\r\n   x   y    z\r\n0  1  10  abc\r\n1  2  20  def\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-05 at 10 58 30 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506656/83914110-6f3b3080-a725-11ea-88c0-de83a833b05c.png)\r\n\r\nbut if Arrow execution is enabled, it shows only plan nodes and the duration is not correct:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled', True)\r\n>>> df.toPandas()\r\n   x   y    z\r\n0  1  10  abc\r\n1  2  20  def\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-05 at 10 58 42 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506656/83914127-782c0200-a725-11ea-84e4-74d861d5c20a.png)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. This PR apply `SharedThriftServer` trait to all  ThriftServer related tests including \r\n```\r\nHiveThriftBinaryServerSuite\r\nHiveThriftCleanUpScratchDirSuite\r\nHiveThriftHttpServerSuite\r\nJdbcConnectionUriSuite\r\nSingleSessionSuite\r\nSparkMetadataOperationSuite\r\nSparkThriftServerProtocolVersionsSuite\r\nUISeleniumSuite\r\n```\r\n`SharedThriftServer` can use a random free port to reduce the flakiness of these tests.\r\n\r\n2. JDBC related tests are moved to the `JdbcConnectionSuite` to test both `http` and `binary` mode. Before some of them are duplicated, and others are only tested in one mode.\r\n3. This PR also re-enabled the `UISeleniumSuite` which has been ignored since 2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. reduce the flakiness of tests.\r\n2. improve test coverage\r\n3. simplification and remove some duplicated tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nResolve the recursive calls in `FileScanRDD`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`FileScanRDD` throw a `StackOverflowError` when read a mass of empty files.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to scan a file source, i.e. `BucketedRead` and `NonBucketedRead`. When scan a file source in `NonBucketedRead` way, spark will calculate how much files will be read in each partition with two important configuration: `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` and `spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes`. With these two config, we can calculate the `maxSplitBytes` in each partition. If there are lots of input files and low parallelism, the `maxSplitBytes` will be `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes`. In my failed job, I set `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` with a large number, like 5GB. It means a spark task will read 5GB files at most. But accidentally, \r\na mass of empty files was produced in my environment. Then a spark task will read a mass of empty files. But the `FileScanRDD` read this files in recursive way:\r\n```\r\n     def hasNext: Boolean = {\r\n        // Kill the task in case it has been marked as killed. This logic is from\r\n        // InterruptibleIterator, but we inline it here instead of wrapping the iterator in order\r\n        // to avoid performance overhead.\r\n        context.killTaskIfInterrupted()\r\n        (currentIterator != null && currentIterator.hasNext) || nextIterator()\r\n      }\r\n\r\n     private def nextIterator(): Boolean = {\r\n         ...\r\n         try {\r\n           hasNext\r\n         } catch {\r\n         ...\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n`(currentIterator != null && currentIterator.hasNext)` always is `false`, and finally this will trigger a `StackOverflowError`.\r\n\r\n!!! **Have to admit**, it is a corner case as  a mass of empty files was produced in my environment accidentally.\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.StackOverflowError\r\n\tat

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we throw `SparkUpgradeException` when getting `DateTimeException` for datetime formatting in the `EXCEPTION` legacy Time Parser Policy.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`DateTimeException` is also declared by `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter#format`, but in Spark, it can barely occur. We have suspected one that due to a JDK bug so far. see https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8079628.\r\n\r\nFor `from_unixtime` function, we will suppress the DateTimeException caused by `DD` and result `NULL`. It is a silent date change that should be avoided in Java 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes,  when running on Java8 and using `from_unixtime` function with pattern `DD` to format datetimes, if dayofyear>=100, `SparkUpgradeException` will alert users instead of silently resulting null. For `date_format`, `SparkUpgradeException` take the palace of  `DateTimeException`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nadd unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR add a new rule to support push predicate through join by rewriting join condition to CNF(conjunctive normal form). The following example is the steps of this rule:\r\n\r\n1. Prepare Table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE x(a INT);\r\nCREATE TABLE y(b INT);\r\n...\r\nSELECT * FROM x JOIN y ON ((a < 0 and a > b) or a > 10);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Convert the join condition to CNF:\r\n```\r\n(a < 0 or a > 10) and (a > b or a > 10)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Split conjunctive predicates\r\n\r\nPredicates\r\n---|\r\n(a < 0 or a > 10)\r\n(a > b or a > 10)\r\n\r\n4. Push predicate\r\n\r\nTable | Predicate\r\n--- | ---\r\nx | (a < 0 or a > 10)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove query performance. PostgreSQL, [Impala](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IMPALA-9183) and Hive support this feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test and benchmark test.\r\n\r\n\r\nSQL | Before this PR | After this PR\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\nTPCDS 5T Q13 | 84s | 21s\r\nTPCDS 5T q85 | 66s | 34s\r\nTPCH 1T q19 | 37s |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `Dataset.collectAsArrowToR` and `Dataset.collectAsArrowToPython`, since the code block for `serveToStream` is run in the separate thread, `withAction` finishes as soon as it starts the thread. As a result, it doesn't collect the metrics of the actual action and Query UI shows the plan graph without metrics.\r\n\r\nWe should call `serveToStream` first, then `withAction` in it.\r\n\r\nThe affected functions are:\r\n\r\n- `collect()` in SparkR\r\n- `DataFrame.toPandas()` in PySpark\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen calling toPandas, usually Query UI shows each plan node's metric and corresponding Stage ID and Task ID:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 10, 'abc'), (2, 20, 'def')], schema=['x', 'y', 'z'])\r\n>>> df.toPandas()\r\n   x   y    z\r\n0  1  10  abc\r\n1  2  20  def\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-03 at 4 47 07 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/506656/83815735-bec22380-a675-11ea-8ecc-bf2954731f35.png)\r\n\r\nbut if Arrow execution is enabled, it shows only plan nodes and the duration is not correct:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', True)\r\n>>> df.toPandas()\r\n   x   y    z\r\n0  1  10  abc\r\n1  2  20  def\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-06-03 at 4 47 27

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSet `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` to `true` in:\r\n1. `SparkSQLEnv.init()` of Thrift server, and\r\n2. `SparkSQLSessionManager.openSession()`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Date and timestamp string literals are parsed by using Java 8 time API and Spark's session time zone. Before the changes, date/timestamp values were collected as legacy types `java.sql.Date`/`java.sql.Timestamp`, and the value of such types didn't respect the config `spark.sql.session.timeZone`. To have consistent view, users had to keep JVM time zone and Spark's session time zone in sync.\r\n2. After the changes, formatting of date values doesn't depend on JVM time zone.\r\n3. While returning dates/timestamps of Java 8 type, we can avoid dates/timestamps rebasing from Proleptic Gregorian calendar to the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian), and the issues related to calendar switching.\r\n4. Properly handle negative years (BCE).\r\n5. Consistent conversion of date/timestamp strings to/from internal Catalyst types in both direction to and from Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.

# What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all these attempts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28692 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28719 an https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28727.\r\nthey all have limitations as mentioned in their discussions.\r\n\r\nMaybe the only way is to forbid them all\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese week-based fields need Locale to express their semantics, the first day of the week varies from country to country.\r\n\r\nFrom the Java doc of WeekFields\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * Gets the first day-of-week.\r\n     * <p>\r\n     * The first day-of-week varies by culture.\r\n     * For example, the US uses Sunday, while France and the ISO-8601 standard use Monday.\r\n     * This method returns the first day using the standard {@code DayOfWeek} enum.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return the first day-of-week, not null\r\n     */\r\n    public DayOfWeek getFirstDayOfWeek() {\r\n        return firstDayOfWeek;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut for the SimpleDateFormat, the day-of-week is not localized\r\n\r\n```\r\nu\tDay number of week (1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday)\tNumber\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the default locale we use is the US, so the result moved a day or a year or a week backward.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\nFor the date `2019-12-29(Sunday)`, in the Sunday Start system(e.g. en-US), it belongs to 2020 of week-based-year, in the Monday Start system(en-GB), it goes to 2019. the week-of-week-based-year(w) will be affected too\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT to_csv(named_struct('time', to_timestamp('2019-12-29', 'yyyy-MM-dd')), map('timestampFormat', 'YYYY', 'locale', 'en-US'));\r\n2020\r\nspark-sql> SELECT to_csv(named_struct('time', to_timestamp('2019-12-29', 'yyyy-MM-dd')), map('timestampFormat', 'YYYY', 'locale', 'en-GB'));\r\n2019\r\n\r\nspark-sql> SELECT to_csv(named_struct('time', to_timestamp('2019-12-29', 'yyyy-MM-dd')), map('timestampFormat', 'YYYY-ww-uu', 'locale', 'en-US'));\r\n2020-01-01\r\nspark-sql> SELECT to_csv(named_struct('time', to_timestamp('2019-12-29', 'yyyy-MM-dd')), map('timestampFormat', 'YYYY-ww-uu', 'locale', 'en-GB'));\r\n2019-52-07\r\n\r\nspark-sql> SELECT to_csv(named_struct('time', to_timestamp('2020-01-05', 'yyyy-MM-dd')), map('timestampFormat', 'YYYY-ww-uu', 'locale', 'en-US'));\r\n2020-02-01\r\nspark-sql> SELECT to_csv(named_struct('time', to_timestamp('2020-01-05', 'yyyy-MM-dd')), map('timestampFormat', 'YYYY-ww-uu', 'locale', 'en-GB'));\r\n2020-01-07\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor other countries, please refer to [First Day of the Week in Different Countries](http://chartsbin.com/view/41671)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

# What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR set a cache entry for the `key[fisrtdayofweek + minimalDaysInFirstWeek]` (Sunday +1) with a default value `java.time.temporal.WeekFields.ISO` to provide Monday as the start of week system-widely.\r\n\r\nThe default locale and custom locale will all obey this rule. so the meaning of `u` for localized can be removed in doc as it does not change via different locales, which makes it closer to 2.4.\r\n\r\nBoth https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28692 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28719 have limitations as mentioned in their discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese week-based fields need Locale to express their semantics, the first day of the week varies from country to country.\r\n\r\nFrom the Java doc of WeekFields\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * Gets the first day-of-week.\r\n     * <p>\r\n     * The first day-of-week varies by culture.\r\n     * For example, the US uses Sunday, while France and the ISO-8601 standard use Monday.\r\n     * This method returns the first day using the standard {@code DayOfWeek} enum.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return the first day-of-week, not null\r\n     */\r\n    public DayOfWeek getFirstDayOfWeek() {\r\n        return firstDayOfWeek;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut for the SimpleDateFormat, the day-of-week is not localized\r\n\r\n```\r\nu\tDay number of week (1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday)\tNumber\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the default locale we use is the US, so the result moved a day backward.\r\n\r\nFor other countries, please refer to [First Day of the Week in Different Countries](http://chartsbin.com/view/41671)\r\n\r\nWith this change, it restores the first day of week calculating for functions when using the default locale.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, the values of week-based items will be fixed, e.g.\r\n\r\nFor the date `2019-12-29(Sunday)`, in the Sunday Start system(e.g. en-US), it belongs to 2020 of week-based-year, in the Monday Start system(en-GB), it goes to 2019. the week-of-week-based-year(w) will be affected too\r\n\r\n####

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to fix the silent result changing between Spark 2.4 and 3.0 reported by  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28692\r\n\r\nSince we can't find a way to simulate the behavior of pattern `u` in the legacy formatter API, this PR proposes to forbid `u`, and users should use `e` or  `E` instead, according to their needs. Then at least it's an explicit error instead of a silent result changing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo avoid silent result changing in Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now query will fail if `u`  exists in the datetime pattern.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26589, which caches the table relations to speed up the table lookup. However, it brings some side effects: the rule `ResolveRelations` may return exactly the same relations, while before it always returns relations with fresh attribute IDs.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to eliminate this side effect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere is no bug report yet, but this side effect may impact things like self-join. It's better to restore the 2.4 behavior and always return refresh relations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to activate `hadoop-2.7` profile by default in Kubernetes IT module.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhile SPARK-31881 added Hadoop 3.2 support, one default test dependency was moved to `hadoop-2.7` profile. It works when we give one of `hadoop-2.7` and `hadoop-3.2`, but it fails when we don't give any profile.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test-compile -pl resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests -Pkubernetes-integration-tests\r\n...\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /APACHE/spark-merge/resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/k8s/integrationtest/DepsTestsSuite.scala:23:\r\nobject amazonaws is not a member of package com\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test-compile -pl resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests -Pkubernetes-integration-tests\r\n..\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default activated profile will be override when we give `hadoop-3.2`.\r\n```\r\n$ mvn help:active-profiles -Pkubernetes-integration-tests\r\n...\r\nActive Profiles for Project 'org.apache.spark:spark-kubernetes-integration-tests_2.12:jar:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT':\r\n\r\nThe following profiles are active:\r\n\r\n - hadoop-2.7 (source: org.apache.spark:spark-kubernetes-integration-tests_2.12:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT)\r\n - kubernetes-integration-tests (source: org.apache.spark:spark-parent_2.12:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT)\r\n - test-java-home (source: org.apache.spark:spark-parent_2.12:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ mvn help:active-profiles -Pkubernetes-integration-tests -Phadoop-3.2\r\n...\r\nActive Profiles for Project 'org.apache.spark:spark-kubernetes-integration-tests_2.12:jar:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT':\r\n\r\nThe following profiles are active:\r\n\r\n - hadoop-3.2 (source: org.apache.spark:spark-kubernetes-integration-tests_2.12:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT)\r\n - hadoop-3.2 (source: org.apache.spark:spark-parent_2.12:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT)\r\n - kubernetes-integration-tests (source: org.apache.spark:spark-parent_2.12:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT)\r\n - test-java-home (source: org.apache.spark:spark-parent_2.12:3.1.0-SNAPSHOT)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins UT and IT.\r\n\r\nCurrently, all Jenkins build and tests (UT & IT) passes without this patch. This should be tested manually with the above command.\r\n\r\n`hadoop-3.2` K8s IT also passed like the following.\r\n```\r\nKubernetesSuite:\r\n- Run SparkPi with no resources\r\n- Run SparkPi with a very long application name.\r\n- Use SparkLauncher.NO_RESOURCE\r\n- Run SparkPi with a master URL without a scheme.\r\n- Run SparkPi with an argument.\r\n- Run SparkPi with custom labels, annotations,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use the specified time zone ID via `DateFormatter.apply()` or `DateFormatter.getLegacyFormatter()`, and pass it to `SimpleDateFormat`/`FastDateFormat`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the date formatter can delegate formatting/parsing to the legacy formatters in some cases but the formatters ignore the time zone specified via the `zoneId` parameter, and use another time zone returned by `TimeZone.getDefault()`. Ignoring of input parameters is bad practice.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, if the default JVM time zone and the session time zone controlled by the SQL config `spark.sql.session.timeZone` are the same. That's the default case. If an user sets different value to the session and JVM time zones, he/she can observe different results.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified tests in `DateFormatterSuite` to check that legacy date formatters don't depend on the default JVM time zone and respect to Spark's session time

What is changed?\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds the ability to migrate shuffle files during Spark's decommissioning. The design document associated with this change is at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xVO1b6KAwdUhjEJBolVPl9C6sLj7oOveErwDSYdT-pE .\r\n\r\nTo allow this change the `MapOutputTracker` has been extended to allow the location of shuffle files to be updated with `updateMapOutput`. When a shuffle block is put, a block update message will be sent which triggers the `updateMapOutput`.\r\n\r\nInstead of rejecting remote puts of shuffle blocks `BlockManager` delegates the storage of shuffle blocks to it's shufflemanager's resolver (if supported). A new, experimental, trait is added for shuffle resolvers to indicate they handle remote putting of blocks.\r\n\r\nThe existing block migration code is moved out into a separate file, and a producer/consumer model is introduced for migrating shuffle files from the host as quickly as possible while not overwhelming other executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRecomputting shuffle blocks can be expensive, we should take advantage of our decommissioning time to migrate these blocks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new configs parameters, `spark.storage.decommission.shuffleBlocks.enabled` & `spark.storage.decommission.rddBlocks.enabled` that control which blocks should be migrated during storage decommissioning.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test & expansion of the Spark on K8s decom test to assert that decommisioning with shuffle block migration means that the results are not recomputed even when the original executor is terminated.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a cleaned-up version of the previous WIP PR I made https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28331 (thanks to @attilapiros for his very helpful reviewing on it

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce UnsafeRow format validation for streaming state store.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, Structured Streaming directly puts the UnsafeRow into StateStore without any schema validation. It's a dangerous behavior when users reusing the checkpoint file during migration. Any changes or bug fix related to the aggregate function may cause random exceptions, even the wrong answer, e.g SPARK-28067.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. If the underlying changes are detected when the checkpoint is reused during migration, the InvalidUnsafeRowException will be thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT added. Will also add integrated tests for more scenario in another PR separately.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-02T18:35:21Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T06:21:18Z","closed_at":"2020-06-19T05:57:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61855ddb2ff7163155aae540d1eb1b217649ecff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR disables week-based date filed for parsing\r\n\r\ncloses #28674\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. It's an un-fixable behavior change to fill the gap between SimpleDateFormat and DateTimeFormater and backward-compatibility for different JDKs.A lot of effort has been made to prove it at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28674\r\n\r\n2. The existing behavior itself in 2.4 is confusing, e.g.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select to_timestamp('1', 'w');\r\n1969-12-28 00:00:00\r\nspark-sql> select to_timestamp('1', 'u');\r\n1970-01-05 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n  The 'u' here seems not to go to the Monday of the first week in week-based form or the first day of the year in non-week-based form but go to the Monday of the second week in week-based form.\r\n\r\nAnd, e.g.\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select to_timestamp('2020 2020', 'YYYY yyyy');\r\n2020-01-01 00:00:00\r\nspark-sql> select to_timestamp('2020 2020', 'yyyy YYYY');\r\n2019-12-29 00:00:00\r\nspark-sql> select to_timestamp('2020 2020 1', 'YYYY yyyy w');\r\nNULL\r\nspark-sql> select to_timestamp('2020 2020 1', 'yyyy YYYY w');\r\n2019-12-29 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n  I think we don't need to introduce all the weird behavior from Java\r\n\r\n3. The current test coverage for week-based date fields is almost 0%, which indicates that we've never imagined using it.\r\n\r\n4. Avoiding JDK bugs\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31880\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the 'Y/W/w/u/F/E' pattern cannot be used datetime parsing functions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nmore tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSet `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` to `true` in `hiveResultString()`, and restore it back at the end of the call.\r\n\r\nThis is the cherry-pick of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27552 from which I reverted the changes in `SparkExecuteStatementOperation.scala` because @juliuszsompolski PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28671 solves the issue of converting Java 8 types to strings.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Date and timestamp string literals are parsed by using Java 8 time API and Spark's session time zone. Before the changes, date/timestamp values were collected as legacy types `java.sql.Date`/`java.sql.Timestamp`, and the value of such types didn't respect the config `spark.sql.session.timeZone`. To have consistent view, users had to keep JVM time zone and Spark's session time zone in sync.\r\n2. After the changes, formatting of date values doesn't depend on JVM time zone.\r\n3. While returning dates/timestamps of Java 8 type, we can avoid dates/timestamps rebasing from Proleptic Gregorian calendar to the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian), and the issues related to calendar switching.\r\n4. Properly handle negative years (BCE).\r\n5. Consistent conversion of date/timestamp strings to/from internal Catalyst types in both direction to and from Spark.\r\n6. The changes make possible the optimisation made in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28687 because the date formatter becomes independent from JVM time zone settings.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select make_date(-44, 3, 15);\r\n0045-03-15\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select make_date(-44, 3, 15);\r\n-0044-03-15\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running hive-thiftserver tests. In particular:\r\n```\r\n./build/sbt -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"hive-thriftserver/test:testOnly *SparkThriftServerProtocolVersionsSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2020-06-02T09:20:11Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:45:12Z","closed_at":"2020-06-05T16:29:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"538fe8c30f70608928ea9adedabf397eaae28ec6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/74dfe4d428000ec31c6cdaac8c35301b904d1d1d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:hive-thriftserver-java8-time-api-2","ref":"hive-thriftserver-java8-time-api-2","sha":"74dfe4d428000ec31c6cdaac8c35301b904d1d1d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds user-specified fold column support to `CrossValidator`. User can assign fold numbers to dataset instead of letting Spark do random splits.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis gives `CrossValidator` users more flexibility in splitting folds.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, a new `foldCol` param is added to `CrossValidator`. User can use it to specify custom fold splitting.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2020-06-02T08:41:40Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:23:47Z","closed_at":"2020-06-16T23:46:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86a4b462df79b74abaca127dfecd64c6cd8dcb30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28704/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28704/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28704/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/218db10533bb803807e453a9288402b2415eaa30","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-31777","ref":"SPARK-31777","sha":"218db10533bb803807e453a9288402b2415eaa30","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports the change of #28627 .\r\nSome fixes for UI like #28690 should be merged to `branch-3.0` including testcases so #28627 is need to be backported.\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly adds two things.\r\n\r\n1. Real headless browser support for UI test\r\n2. A test suite using headless Chrome as one instance of  those browsers.\r\n\r\nAlso, for environment where Chrome and Chrome driver is not installed, `ChromeUITest` tag is added to filter out the test suite.\r\nBy default, test suites with `ChromeUITest` is disabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn `branch-3.0`, there are two problems for UI test.\r\n1. Lots of tests especially JavaScript related ones are done manually.\r\nAppearance is better to be confirmed by our eyes but logic should be tested by test cases ideally.\r\n \r\n2. Compared to the real web browsers, HtmlUnit doesn't seem to support JavaScript enough.\r\nI added a JavaScript related test before for SPARK-31534 using HtmlUnit which is simple library based headless browser for test.\r\nThe test I added works somehow but some JavaScript related error is shown in unit-tests.log.\r\n\r\n```\r\n======= EXCEPTION START ========\r\nException class=[net.sourceforge.htmlunit.corejs.javascript.JavaScriptException]\r\ncom.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit.ScriptException: Error: TOOLTIP: Option \"sanitizeFn\" provided type \"window\" but expected type \"(null|function)\".

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Modified `ParquetFilters.valueCanMakeFilterOn()` to accept filters with `java.time.Instant` attributes.\r\n2. Added `ParquetFilters.timestampToMicros()` to support both types `java.sql.Timestamp` and `java.time.Instant` in conversions to microseconds.\r\n3. Re-used `timestampToMicros` in constructing of Parquet filters. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support pushed down filters with `java.time.Instant` attributes. Before the changes, date filters are not pushed down to Parquet datasource when `spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled` is `true`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified tests to `ParquetFilterSuite` to check the case when Java 8 API is enabled.","created_at":"2020-06-01T17:30:53Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:45:09Z","closed_at":"2020-06-02T11:54:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a1c4cfb4f54453ace8b87604575b03d0a191ca15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28696/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28696/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28696/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a0a5923325592424ce78f5881573b337b8e4e300","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:support-instant-parquet-filters","ref":"support-instant-parquet-filters","sha":"a0a5923325592424ce78f5881573b337b8e4e300","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to check `DetectAmbiguousSelfJoin` only if there is `Join` in the plan. Currently, the checking is too strict even to non-join queries.\r\n\r\nFor example, the codes below don't have join at all but it fails as the ambiguous self-join:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Window\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.sum\r\nval df = Seq(1, 1, 2, 2).toDF(\"A\")\r\nval w = Window.partitionBy(df(\"A\"))\r\ndf.select(df(\"A\").alias(\"X\"), sum(df(\"A\")).over(w)).explain(true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is because `ExtractWindowExpressions` can create a `AttributeReference` with the same metadata but a different expression ID, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0fd98abd859049dc3b200492487041eeeaa8f737/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala#L2679\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/71c73d58f6e88d2558ed2e696897767d93bac60f/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/plans/logical/basicLogicalOperators.scala#L63\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5945d46c11a86fd85f9e65f24c2e88f368eee01f/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/namedExpressions.scala#L180\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n'Project [A#19 AS X#21, sum(A#19) windowspecdefinition(A#19, specifiedwindowframe(RowFrame, unboundedpreceding$(), unboundedfollowing$())) AS sum(A) OVER (PARTITION BY A unspecifiedframe$())#23L]\r\n+- Relation[A#19] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProject [X#21, sum(A) OVER (PARTITION BY A unspecifiedframe$())#23L]\r\n+- Project [X#21, A#19, sum(A) OVER (PARTITION BY A unspecifiedframe$())#23L, sum(A) OVER (PARTITION BY A unspecifiedframe$())#23L]\r\n   +- Window [sum(A#19) windowspecdefinition(A#19, specifiedwindowframe(RowFrame, unboundedpreceding$(), unboundedfollowing$())) AS sum(A) OVER (PARTITION BY A unspecifiedframe$())#23L], [A#19]\r\n      +- Project [A#19 AS X#21, A#19]\r\n         +- Relation[A#19] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\n`X#21` holds the same metadata of DataFrame ID and column position with `A#19` but it has a different expression ID which ends up with the checking fails.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo loose the checking and make users not surprised.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt's the changes in unreleased branches only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unittest was added.\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-01T14:09:30Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:44:38Z","closed_at":"2020-06-01T23:31:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4dfe3407a9cc455ed60ace73ec9b57ba20c8ac09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28695/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28695/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28695/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/21e4241a95b7bd7aa01c0257accbf2a017e1afa3","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-28344-followup","ref":"SPARK-28344-followup","sha":"21e4241a95b7bd7aa01c0257accbf2a017e1afa3","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a wrong coloring issue in the DAG-viz.\r\nIn the Job Page and Stage Page, nodes which are associated with \"barrier mode\" in the DAG-viz will be colored pale green.\r\nBut, with some type of jobs, nodes which are not associated with the mode will also colored.\r\nYou can reproduce with the following operation.\r\n```\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10).barrier.mapPartitions(identity).repartition(1).collect() \r\n```\r\n<img width=\"376\" alt=\"wrong-coloring\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/83403670-1711df00-a444-11ea-9457-c683f75bc566.png\">\r\n\r\nIn the screen shot above, `repartition` in `Stage 1` is not associated with barrier mode so the corresponding node should not be colored pale green.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this issue is the logic which chooses HTML elements to be colored is wrong.\r\nThe logic chooses such elements based on whether each element is associated with a style class (`clusterId` in the code). \r\nBut when an operation crosses over shuffle (like `repartition` above), a `clusterId` can be duplicated and non-barrier mode node is also associated with the same `clusterId`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNewly added test case with the following command.\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Dtest.default.exclude.tags=

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixed conversions of `java.sql.Timestamp` to milliseconds in `ParquetFilter` by using existing functions from `DateTimeUtils` `fromJavaTimestamp()` and `microsToMillis()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the bug:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.parquet.outputTimestampType\", \"TIMESTAMP_MILLIS\")\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\", \"CORRECTED\")\r\nscala> Seq(java.sql.Timestamp.valueOf(\"1000-06-14

introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the changes (for the example above):\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/ts_millis_old_filter\").filter($\"ts\" ===

# What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR switches the default Locale from the `US` to `GB` to change the behavior of the first day of the week from Sunday-started to Monday-started as same as v2.4\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n#### cases\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select to_timestamp('2020-1-1', 'YYYY-w-u');\r\n2019-12-29 00:00:00\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy=legacy;\r\nspark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy\tlegacy\r\nspark-sql> select to_timestamp('2020-1-1', 'YYYY-w-u');\r\n2019-12-30 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### reasons\r\n\r\nThese week-based fields need Locale to express their semantics, the first day of the week varies from country to country.\r\n\r\nFrom the Java doc of WeekFields\r\n```java\r\n    /**\r\n     * Gets the first day-of-week.\r\n     * <p>\r\n     * The first day-of-week varies by culture.\r\n     * For example, the US uses Sunday, while France and the ISO-8601 standard use Monday.\r\n     * This method returns the first day using the standard {@code DayOfWeek} enum.\r\n     *\r\n     * @return the first day-of-week, not null\r\n     */\r\n    public DayOfWeek getFirstDayOfWeek() {\r\n        return firstDayOfWeek;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut for the SimpleDateFormat, the day-of-week is not localized\r\n\r\n```\r\nu\tDay number of week (1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday)\tNumber\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the default locale we use is the US, so the result moved a day backward.\r\n\r\nFor other countries, please refer to [First Day of the Week in Different Countries](http://chartsbin.com/view/41671)\r\n\r\nWith this change, it restores the first day of week calculating for functions when using the default locale.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, but the behavior change is used to restore the old one of v2.4\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadd unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-01T08:45:41Z","updated_at":"2020-06-04T05:50:36Z","closed_at":"2020-06-03T06:08:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f13734aada9716b34b0e7c4824207243e0b82520","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f94c72be5edc5846b64bef8ed81a24a9109716c8","head":{"label":"yaooqinn:SPARK-31879","ref":"SPARK-31879","sha":"f94c72be5edc5846b64bef8ed81a24a9109716c8","user":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b806fc458265578fddf544363b60fb5e122439b5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Replace `def dateFormatter` to `val dateFormatter`.\r\n2. Modify the `date formatting in hive result` test in `HiveResultSuite` to check modified code on various time zones.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid creation of `DateFormatter` per every incoming date in `HiveResult.toHiveString`. This should eliminate unnecessary creation of `SimpleDateFormat` instances and compilation of the default pattern `yyyy-MM-dd`. The changes can speed up processing of legacy date values of the `java.sql.Date` type which is collected by default.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified a test in `HiveResultSuite`.","created_at":"2020-05-31T20:18:31Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T12:27:43Z","closed_at":"2020-06-03T12:00:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"51ae465719753a5cc5bba3ec192e1e9822e63270","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28687/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28687/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28687/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/698454489d63b2f7599f3f36e87eb6994362c061","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:HiveResult-val-dateFormatter","ref":"HiveResult-val-dateFormatter","sha":"698454489d63b2f7599f3f36e87eb6994362c061","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs part of **DetermineTableStats** rule we compute the stats for a HiveTableRelation, whcih can b an expensive operation. And it could happen multiple times for a query(SPARK-31850).\r\n\r\nIn most cases(the flag for converting Parquet and Orc table to datasource table is enabled by default in master branch), **RelationConversion** rule converts the HiveTableRelation to LogicalRelation.\r\nWhen the conversion happens, the stats computed as part of Hive Table relation does not get used.\r\n\r\nIn this change,  stats compute is avoided by performing the conversion before computing stats.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith the change, stats for Hive table will not be computed unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt was tested on local machine and  behaviour verified.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-31T17:59:25Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T00:39:15Z","closed_at":"2020-11-20T00:39:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f444d82248ccc733b35d23e2a3fb96676b3ecf85","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28686/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28686/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28686/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ce6fbb20204b77d20043709a7fd05c72a8b98bd","head":{"label":"karuppayya:SPARK-31877","ref":"SPARK-31877","sha":"3ce6fbb20204b77d20043709a7fd05c72a8b98bd","user":{"login":"karuppayya","id":5082742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODI3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5082742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya","html_url":"https://github.com/karuppayya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40343047,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDM0MzA0Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"karuppayya/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"karuppayya","id":5082742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODI3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5082742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya","html_url":"https://github.com/karuppayya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karuppayya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28673 and suggested via @cloud-fan at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28673#discussion_r432817075\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we disable datetime pattern in the form of `y..y` and `Y..Y` whose lengths are greater than 10 to avoid sort of JDK bug as described below\r\n\r\nhe new datetime formatter introduces silent data change like,\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select from_unixtime(1, 'yyyyyyyyyyy-MM-dd');\r\nNULL\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy=legacy;\r\nspark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy\tlegacy\r\nspark-sql> select from_unixtime(1, 'yyyyyyyyyyy-MM-dd');\r\n00000001970-01-01\r\nspark-sql>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor patterns that support `SignStyle.EXCEEDS_PAD`, e.g. `y..y`(len >=4), when using the `NumberPrinterParser` to format it\r\n\r\n```java\r\nswitch (signStyle) {\r\n  case EXCEEDS_PAD:\r\n    if (minWidth < 19 && value >= EXCEED_POINTS[minWidth]) {\r\n      buf.append(decimalStyle.getPositiveSign());\r\n    }\r\n    break;\r\n   \r\n           ....\r\n``` \r\nthe `minWidth` == `len(y..y)`\r\nthe `EXCEED_POINTS` is \r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n         * Array of 10 to the power of n.\r\n         */\r\n        static final long[] EXCEED_POINTS = new long[] {\r\n            0L,\r\n            10L,\r\n            100L,\r\n            1000L,\r\n            10000L,\r\n            100000L,\r\n            1000000L,\r\n            10000000L,\r\n            100000000L,\r\n            1000000000L,\r\n            10000000000L,\r\n        };\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when the `len(y..y)` is greater than 10, ` ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` will be raised.\r\n\r\n And at the caller side, for `from_unixtime`, the exception will be suppressed and silent data change occurs. for `date_format`, the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` will continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfix silent data change\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, SparkUpgradeException will take place of `null` result when the pattern contains 10 or more continuous  'y' or 'Y' \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Replace `SimpleDateFormat` by `FastDateFormat` as the legacy formatter of `FractionTimestampFormatter`.\r\n2. Optimise `LegacyFastTimestampFormatter` for `java.sql.Timestamp` w/o fractional part.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. By default `HiveResult`.`hiveResultString` retrieves timestamps values as instances of `java.sql.Timestamp`, and uses the legacy parser `SimpleDateFormat` to convert the timestamps to strings. After the fix https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28024, the fractional formatter and its companion - legacy formatter `SimpleDateFormat` are created per every value. By switching from `LegacySimpleTimestampFormatter` to `LegacyFastTimestampFormatter`, we can utilize the internal cache of `FastDateFormat`, and avoid parsing the default pattern `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`.\r\n2. The second change in the method `def format(ts: Timestamp): String` of `LegacyFastTimestampFormatter` is needed to optimize the formatter for patterns without the fractional part and avoid conversions to microseconds.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing tests in `TimestampFormatter`.","created_at":"2020-05-30T10:39:38Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:45:05Z","closed_at":"2020-05-31T13:05:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50bdecb4c3c74adb81051cbff1aa16ceef19cfc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5e050ea85eec9e662e5b7b49f483f3de32913931","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fastdateformat-as-legacy-frac-formatter","ref":"fastdateformat-as-legacy-frac-formatter","sha":"5e050ea85eec9e662e5b7b49f483f3de32913931","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

However, if the join type of `BroadcastHashJoinExec` is an inner-like join, the build side's info (the join keys) can be added to `BroadcastHashJoinExec`'s `outputPartitioning`.\r\n\r\n For example,\r\n```Scala\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold\", \"500\")\r\nval t1 = (0 until 100).map(i => (i % 5, i % 13)).toDF(\"i1\", \"j1\")\r\nval t2 = (0 until 100).map(i => (i % 5, i % 13)).toDF(\"i2\", \"j2\")\r\nval t3 = (0 until 20).map(i => (i % 7, i % 11)).toDF(\"i3\", \"j3\")\r\nval t4 = (0 until 100).map(i => (i % 5, i % 13)).toDF(\"i4\", \"j4\")\r\n\r\n// join1 is a sort merge join.\r\nval join1 = t1.join(t2, t1(\"i1\") === t2(\"i2\"))\r\n\r\n// join2 is a broadcast join where t3 is broadcasted.\r\nval join2 = join1.join(t3, join1(\"i1\") === t3(\"i3\"))\r\n\r\n// Join on the column from the broadcasted side (i3).\r\nval join3 = join2.join(t4, join2(\"i3\") === t4(\"i4\"))\r\n\r\njoin3.explain\r\n```\r\nYou see that `Exchange hashpartitioning(i2#103, 200)` is introduced because there is no output partitioning info from the build side.\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(6) SortMergeJoin [i3#29], [i4#40], Inner\r\n:- *(4) Sort [i3#29 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(i3#29, 200), true, [id=#55]\r\n:     +- *(3) BroadcastHashJoin [i1#7], [i3#29], Inner, BuildRight\r\n:        :- *(3) SortMergeJoin [i1#7], [i2#18], Inner\r\n:        :  :- *(1) Sort [i1#7 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:        :  :  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(i1#7, 200), true, [id=#28]\r\n:        :  :     +- LocalTableScan [i1#7, j1#8]\r\n:        :  +- *(2) Sort [i2#18 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:        :     +- Exchange hashpartitioning(i2#18, 200), true, [id=#29]\r\n:        :        +- LocalTableScan [i2#18, j2#19]\r\n:        +- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(cast(input[0, int, false] as bigint))), [id=#34]\r\n:           +- LocalTableScan [i3#29, j3#30]\r\n+- *(5) Sort [i4#40 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(i4#40, 200), true, [id=#39]\r\n      +- LocalTableScan [i4#40, j4#41]\r\n```\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce output partitioning for the build side for `BroadcastHashJoinExec` if the streamed side has a `HashPartitioning` or a collection of `HashPartitioning`s.\r\n\r\nThere is a new internal config `spark.sql.execution.broadcastHashJoin.outputPartitioningExpandLimit`, which can limit the number of partitioning a `HashPartitioning` can expand to. It can be set to \"0\" to disable this feature.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn 3.0, the new approach in datetime parser can not extract the week-based-year field, so it goes\r\nidempotently to 1970.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n\r\nspark-sql> explain select to_timestamp('1969-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-dd');\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [-28800000000 AS to_timestamp(1969-01-01, YYYY-MM-dd)#37]\r\n+-

version 2.4, the result will be the last Sunday of the past year(It is weird too!)\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select to_timestamp('1969-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-dd');\r\n1968-12-29 00:00:00\r\nspark-sql>

3.0. Since in 3.0 it is much weirder.\r\n\r\nFYI, Postgres may set a good example here, https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/functions-formatting.html \r\n\r\n> Caution\r\n--\r\nWhile to_date will reject a mixture of Gregorian and ISO week-numbering date fields, to_char will not, since output format specifications like YYYY-MM-DD (IYYY-IDDD) can be useful. But avoid writing something like IYYY-MM-DD; that would yield surprising results near the start of the year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nbugfix and behavior change restoration\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the behavior will be restored.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nadded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nthe new datetime formatter introduces silent data change like,\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select from_unixtime(1, 'yyyyyyyyyyy-MM-dd');\r\nNULL\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy=legacy;\r\nspark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy\tlegacy\r\nspark-sql> select from_unixtime(1, 'yyyyyyyyyyy-MM-dd');\r\n00000001970-01-01\r\nspark-sql>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor patterns that support `SignStyle.EXCEEDS_PAD`, e.g. `y..y`(len >=4), when using the `NumberPrinterParser` to format it\r\n\r\n```java\r\nswitch (signStyle) {\r\n  case EXCEEDS_PAD:\r\n    if (minWidth < 19 && value >= EXCEED_POINTS[minWidth]) {\r\n      buf.append(decimalStyle.getPositiveSign());\r\n    }\r\n    break;\r\n   \r\n           ....\r\n``` \r\nthe `minWidth` == `len(y..y)`\r\nthe `EXCEED_POINTS` is \r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n         * Array of 10 to the power of n.\r\n         */\r\n        static final long[] EXCEED_POINTS = new long[] {\r\n            0L,\r\n            10L,\r\n            100L,\r\n            1000L,\r\n            10000L,\r\n            100000L,\r\n            1000000L,\r\n            10000000L,\r\n            100000000L,\r\n            1000000000L,\r\n            10000000000L,\r\n        };\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when the `len(y..y)` is greater than 10, ` ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` will be raised.\r\n\r\n And at the caller side, for `from_unixtime`, the exception will be suppressed and silent data change occurs. for `date_format`, the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` will continue.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, for `EXCEPTION` mode, we wrapped exceptions from the new formatter during formatting to `SparkUpgradeException` for end-users to make proper decisions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nfix silent data change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, SparkUpgradeException will take place of `null` result when something is wrong during new formatter's formatting phase.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd unit tests,\r\n\r\nthe `sql/core/src/test/resources/sql-tests/results/datetime-corrected.sql.out` is added for different behaviors from the caller sides.","created_at":"2020-05-29T08:20:14Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T08:19:31Z","closed_at":"2020-06-03T08:19:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9aaea747ef0b6dc4b76a91edc35fdaf4c992990b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5da8c3db37e19427c8729b645c354bce707bb28","head":{"label":"yaooqinn:SPARK-31867","ref":"SPARK-31867","sha":"a5da8c3db37e19427c8729b645c354bce707bb28","user":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"91148f428b61b5e44c17bd65ceff74e0a8b4b3f5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTimestamp literals in Spark are interpreted as timestamps in local timezone spark.sql.session.timeZone.\r\n\r\nIf JDBC client is e.g. in TimeZone UTC-7, and sets spark.sql.session.timeZone to PST, and sends a query \"SELECT timestamp '2020-05-20 12:00:00'\", and the JVM timezone of the Spark cluster is e.g. UTC+2, then what currently happens is:\r\n* The timestamp literal in the query is interpreted as 12:00:00 UTC-7, i.e. 19:00:00 UTC.\r\n* When it's returned from the query, it is collected as a java.sql.Timestamp object with Dataset.collect(), and put into a Thriftserver RowSet.\r\n* Before sending it over the wire, the Timestamp is converted to String. This happens in explicitly in ColumnValue for RowBasedSet, and implicitly in ColumnBuffer for ColumnBasedSet (all non-primitive types are converted toString() there). The conversion toString uses JVM timezone, which results in a \"21:00:00\" (UTC+2) string representation.\r\n* The client JDBC application parses gets a \"21:00:00\" Timestamp back (in it's JVM timezone; if the JDBC application cares about the correct UTC internal value, it should set spark.sql.session.timeZone to be consistent with its JVM timezone)\r\n\r\nThe problem is caused by the conversion happening in Thriftserver RowSet with the generic toString() function, instead of using HiveResults.toHiveString() that takes care of correct, timezone respecting conversions. This PR fixes it by converting the Timestamp values to String earlier, in SparkExecuteStatementOperation, using that function. This fixes SPARK-31861.\r\n\r\nThriftserver also did not work spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled, because the conversions in RowSet expected an Timestamp object instead of Instant object. Using HiveResults.toHiveString() also fixes that. For this reason, we also convert Date values in SparkExecuteStatementOperation as well - so that HiveResults.toHiveString() handles LocalDate as well. This fixes SPARK-31859.\r\n\r\nThriftserver also did not correctly set the active SparkSession. Because of that, configuration obtained using SQLConf.get was not the correct session configuration. This affected getting the correct spark.sql.session.timeZone. It is fixed by extending the use of SparkExecuteStatementOperation.withSchedulerPool to also set the correct active SparkSession. When the correct session is set, we also no longer need to maintain the pool mapping in a sessionToActivePool map. The scheduler pool can be just correctly retrieved from the session config. \"withSchedulerPool\" is renamed to \"withLocalProperties\" and moved into a mixin helper trait, because it should be applied with every operation. This fixes SPARK-31863.\r\n\r\nI used the opportunity to move some repetitive code from the operations to the mixin helper

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the issue of complex query stages that contain sub stages not being reused at times due to dynamic plan changes. This PR synchronizes the \"finished\" flag between all reused stages so that the runtime replanning would always produce the same sub plan for their potentially reusable parent stages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWithout this change, complex query stages that contain sub stages will sometimes not be reused due to dynamic plan changes and the status of their child query stages not being synced.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually tested TPC-DS q47 and q57. Before this PR, the reuse of the biggest stage would happen with a 50/50 chance; and after this PR, it will happen 100% of the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR makes a minor change in deciding whether a partition is skewed by comparing the partition size to the median size of coalesced partitions instead of median size of raw partitions before coalescing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change is line with target size criteria of splitting skew join partitions and can also cope with situations of extra empty partitions caused by over-partitioning. This PR has also improved skew join tests in AQE tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR removes the excessive exception wrapping in AQE so that error messages are less verbose and mostly consistent with non-aqe execution. Exceptions from stage materialization are now only wrapped with `SparkException` if there are multiple stage failures. Also, stage cancelling errors will not be included as part the exception thrown, but rather just be error logged.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis will make the AQE error reporting more readable and debuggable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing

setters have been removed from `Params` mixins in `pyspark.ml.param.shared`. Those setters had been part of the public pyspark ML API, hence this is a breaking change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nOnly documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this

**ResolveAggregateFunctions**.\r\n- **ResolveAggregateFunctions** is part of a batch which has **FixedPoint** as its execution strategy, hence the computation can happen any number of times, based on when Fixed point is reached.\r\n- This is not specific to **ResolveAggregateFunctions**, any analyzer rule which invokes _org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer#executeSameContext_ will face this issue.\r\n- In best case , **DetermineTableStats** rule will run atleast **thrice** as part of analysis phase, twice as part of **ResolveAggregateFunctions**(assuming fixed point is reached in the first two attempts ) and once as past of **postHocResolutionRules#DetermineTableStats**\r\n\r\n **Note:** \r\n\r\n- There is no log line in DetermineTableStats to indicate that stats compute happened. Need to add a log line or use a debugger\r\n\r\n- The above can be repro-ed with first query on a created table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nStats computation might be an expensive

needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, PySpark exceptions are very unfriendly to Python users with causing a bunch of JVM stacktrace. See \"Python exception message without this change\" above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will change the exception message. See the examples above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested by\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf spark.sql.pyspark.jvmStacktrace.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nand running the examples above.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-28T05:01:49Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:44:38Z","closed_at":"2020-06-01T00:45:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f1c8ec38eafd6743af4f612382bf6069fa68aa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28661/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28661/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28661/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/28c2a516eec5ffbd527b9e62869b279a162458e4","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:python-debug","ref":"python-debug","sha":"28c2a516eec5ffbd527b9e62869b279a162458e4","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to shift to the new most local locality level if there're any new more local locality levels are added during `TaskSetManager.recomputeLocality`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a race condition between `resourceOffers` and `submitTasks`. If `submitTasks` happens before `resourceOffers`, especially when there are no executors added to `TaskSchedulerImpl` at all, the `TaskSetManager` 's `myLocalityLevels`  will only have ANY locality level, see: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8b4862953a879a9b3ba6f57e669efc383df68b7c/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSetManager.scala#L218\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, `resourceOffers` is called with new executors added to `TaskSchedulerImpl`. Then, `recomputeLocality` will be called because of `executorAdded`. During `recomputeLocality`, the TaskSetManager's `myLocalityLevels` might have PROCESS_LOCAL, NODE_LOCAL, ANY(because at this time we could find alive executors from TaskSchedulerImpl). But the `TaskSetManager` will stick to the previous locality level, which is ANY, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8b4862953a879a9b3ba6f57e669efc383df68b7c/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/TaskSetManager.scala#L1107-L1114\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result, in the first round of `resourceOffers`, the new version delay scheduling won't take effect and  `TaskSetManager` can only schedule tasks at ANY level.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the problem also exists in old version delay scheduling but the impact is minor because we always reset the locality level after successfully launching a task, which is broken in the new version of dealy scheduling.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated and added new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen I was developing some stuff based on the `DeveloperAPI ` `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.HiveThriftServer2#startWithContext`, I need to use thrift port randomly to avoid race on ports. But the `org.apache.hive.service.cli.thrift.ThriftCLIService#getPortNumber` do not respond to me with the actual bound port but always 0.\r\n\r\nAnd the server log is not right too, after starting the server, it's hard to form to the right JDBC connection string.\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO ThriftCLIService: Starting ThriftBinaryCLIService on port 0 with 5...500 worker threads\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIndeed, the `53742` is the right port\r\n```shell\r\nlsof -nP -p `cat ./pid/spark-kentyao-org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver.HiveThriftServer2-1.pid` | grep LISTEN\r\njava    18990 kentyao  288u    IPv6 0x22858e3e60d6a0a7      0t0                 TCP 10.242.189.214:53723 (LISTEN)\r\njava    18990 kentyao  290u    IPv6 0x22858e3e60d68827      0t0                 TCP *:4040 (LISTEN)\r\njava    18990 kentyao  366u    IPv6 0x22858e3e60d66987      0t0                 TCP 10.242.189.214:53724 (LISTEN)\r\njava    18990 kentyao  438u    IPv6 0x22858e3e60d65d47      0t0                 TCP *:53742 (LISTEN)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the PR, when the port is configured 0, the `portNum` will be set to the real used port during the start process.\r\n\r\nAlso use 0 in thrift related tests to avoid potential flakiness.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1 fix API bug\r\n2 reduce test flakiness\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, `org.apache.hive.service.cli.thrift.ThriftCLIService#getPortNumber` will always give you the actual port when it is configured 0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nmodified unit
