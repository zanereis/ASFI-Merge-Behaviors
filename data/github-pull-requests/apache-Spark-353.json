What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n~~https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14498 plans to remove Hive Built-in Hash Functions. 10+ test cases are broken because the results are different from the Hive golden answer files. These broken test cases are not Hive specific. Thus, it makes more sense to move them to `SQLQueryTestSuite`~~\n\nBased on file-based SQL end-to-end testing framework in `SQLQueryTestSuite`, this PR is to create test cases for joins in general.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nLogicalRelationCache is a key-value cache built on Google Guava Cache to speed up building logical plan nodes (`LogicalRelation`) for data source tables. The cache key is a unique identifier of a table. Here, the identifier is the fully qualified table name, including the database in which it resides. (In the future, it could be extended to a multi-part names when introducing federated Catalog). The value is the corresponding `LogicalRelation` that represents a specific data source table.  \nThe cache is session based. In each session, the cache is managed in two different ways at the same time. \n1. **Auto loading**: when Spark querying the cache for a user-defined data source table, the cache either returns a cached `LogicalRelation`, or else automatically builds a new one by decoding the metadata fetched from the external Catalog. \n2. **Manual caching**: Hive serde tables are represented as logical plan nodes `MetastoreRelation`. For better performance, we convert Hive serde tables to data source tables, if convertible. The conversion is not completed at the stage of metadata loading. Instead, it is conducted during semantic analysis. If a Hive serde table is convertible, we first try to get the value (by the fully qualified table name) from the metadata cache. If existed, we use it directly; otherwise, build a new one and also push it into the cache for the future reuse.\n\nCurrently, the file `HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala` contains different entities/functions since all of them require interaction with the cache, called `cachedDataSourceTables`. This PR is to cleanup `HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala`. \n\n**Proposal**: To avoid mixing everything related to cache in the same file, we abstract and define the following API for cache operations. After the code changes, `HiveMetastoreatalog.scala` only contains the cache API implementation. The file name can be renamed to `MetadataCache.scala`\n\n``` Scala\n// cacheTable is a wrapper of cache.put(key, value). It associates value with key in this cache.\n// If the cache previously contained a value associated with key, the old value is replaced by value.\ndef cacheTable(tableIdent: TableIdentifier, plan: LogicalPlan): Unit\n```\n\n``` Scala\n// getTableIfPresent is a wrapper of cache.getIfPresent(key) that never causes values to be automatically loaded.\ndef getTableIfPresent(tableIdent: TableIdentifier): Option[LogicalPlan]\n```\n\n``` Scala\n// getTable is a wrapper of cache.get(key). If cache misses, Caches loaded by a CacheLoader will call\n// CacheLoader.load(K) to load new values into the cache. That means, it will call the function load.\ndef getTable(tableIdent: TableIdentifier): LogicalPlan\n```\n\n``` Scala\n// refreshTable is a wrapper of cache.invalidate. It does not eagerly reload the cache.\n// It just invalidate the cache. Next time when we use the table, it will be populated in the cache.\ndef refreshTable(tableIdent: TableIdentifier): Unit\n```\n\n``` Scala\n// Discards all entries in the cache. It is a wrapper of cache.invalidateAll.\ndef invalidateAll(): Unit\n```\n\nThis PR also moves three Hive-specific Analyzer rules `CreateTables`, `OrcConversions` and `ParquetConversions` from `HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala` to `HiveStrategies.scala`.\n\n**Note:** The LOC is large and it is not easy to review. Please check the change commit history. \n\n**Future work:** Move `MetadataCache` to `sql/core` when we deciding to use it as a cache for all the external catalogs.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWith [SPARK-13992](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13992), Spark supports persisting data into off-heap memory, but the usage of on-heap and off-heap memory is not exposed currently, it is not so convenient for user to monitor and profile, so here propose to expose off-heap memory as well as on-heap memory usage in various places:\n1. Spark UI's executor page will display both on-heap and off-heap memory usage.\n2. REST request returns both on-heap and off-heap memory.\n3. Also this can be gotten from MetricsSystem.\n4. Last this usage can be obtained programmatically from SparkListener.\n\nAttach the UI changes:\n\n![screen shot 2016-08-12 at 11 20 44 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/850797/17612032/6c2f4480-607f-11e6-82e8-a27fb8cbb4ae.png)\n\nBackward compatibility is also considered for event-log and REST API.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds expression `UnresolvedOrdinal` to represent the ordinal in GROUP BY or ORDER BY, and fixes the rules when resolving ordinals.\n\nOrdinals in GROUP BY or ORDER BY like `1` in `order by 1` or `group by 1` should be considered as unresolved before analysis. But in current code, it uses `Literal` expression to store the ordinal. This is inappropriate as `Literal` itself is a resolved expression, it gives the user a wrong message that the ordinals has already been resolved. \n### Before this change\n\nOrdinal is stored as `Literal` expression\n\n```\nscala> sc.setLogLevel(\"TRACE\")\nscala> sql(\"select a from t group by 1 order by 1\")\n...\n'Sort [1 ASC], true  \n +- 'Aggregate [1], ['a]\n     +- 'UnresolvedRelation `t\n```\n\nFor query:\n\n```\nscala> Seq(1).toDF(\"a\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t\")\nscala> sql(\"select count(a), a from t group by 2 having a > 0\").show\n```\n\nDuring analysis, the intermediate plan before applying rule `ResolveAggregateFunctions` is:\n\n```\n'Filter ('a > 0)\n   +- Aggregate [2], [count(1) AS count(1)#83L, a#81]\n        +- LocalRelation [value#7 AS a#9]\n```\n\nBefore this PR, rule `ResolveAggregateFunctions` believes all expressions of `Aggregate` have already been resolved, and tries to resolve the expressions in `Filter` directly. But this is wrong, as ordinal `2` in Aggregate is not really resolved!\n### After this change\n\nOrdinals are stored as `UnresolvedOrdinal`.\n\n```\nscala> sc.setLogLevel(\"TRACE\")\nscala> sql(\"select a from t group by 1 order by 1\")\n...\n'Sort [unresolvedordinal(1) ASC], true\n +- 'Aggregate [unresolvedordinal(1)], ['a]\n      +- 'UnresolvedRelation `t`\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\n\nregisterTempTable(createDataFrame(iris), \"iris\")\nstr(collect(sql(\"select cast('1' as double) as x, cast('2' as decimal) as y  from iris limit 5\")))\n\n'data.frame':   5 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ x: num  1 1 1 1 1\n $ y:List of 5\n  ..$ : num 2\n  ..$ : num 2\n  ..$ : num 2\n  ..$ : num 2\n  ..$ : num 2\n\nThe problem is that spark returns `decimal(10, 0)` col type, instead of `decimal`. Thus, `decimal(10, 0)` is not handled correctly. It should be handled as \"double\".\n\nAs discussed in JIRA thread, we can have two potential fixes:\n1). Scala side fix to add a new case when writing the object back; However, I can't use spark.sql.types._ in Spark core due to dependency issues. I don't find a way of doing type case match;\n\n2). SparkR side fix: Add a helper function to check special type like `\"decimal(10, 0)\"` and replace it with `double`, which is PRIMITIVE type. This special helper is generic for adding new types handling in the future. \n\nI open this PR to discuss pros and cons of both approaches. If we want to do Scala side fix, we need to find a way to match the case of DecimalType and StructType in Spark Core.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark 2.0 parses negative numeric literals as the unary minus of positive literals. This introduces problems for the edge cases such as -9223372036854775809 being parsed as decimal instead of bigint.\n\nThis PR fixes it by make negative integral a direct literal in parser.\n## How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch improves error handling for group-by/order-by ordinals:\n1. Report error position in more places.\n2. Throw AnalysisException instead of UnresolvedException, which is an internal exception not meant for end-users.\n3. Made error messages more consistent.\n\nError messages look like the following:\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException\nGROUP BY position 3 is an aggregate function, and aggregate functions are not allowed in GROUP BY; line 1 pos 39\n```\n\n```\nStar (*) is not allowed in select list when GROUP BY ordinal position is used;\n```\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException\nORDER BY position 3 is not in select list (valid range is [1, 2]); line 1 pos 28\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is tested in SPARK-17015 but I'm submitting this part in isolation so it is easier to back port into branch-2.0. I will submit a separate pull request for SPARK-17015.\n","created_at":"2016-08-11T06:16:57Z","updated_at":"2016-08-11T17:52:06Z","closed_at":"2016-08-11T17:52:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"248ca23c80d71d9a645d475faaef1df1ac895c7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/156d5d8169b5bc5f11f259c889d29a198056d404","head":{"label":"petermaxlee:SPARK-17016","ref":"SPARK-17016","sha":"156d5d8169b5bc5f11f259c889d29a198056d404","user":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62184923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjE4NDkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"petermaxlee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch enhances SQLQueryTestSuite in two ways:\n1. SPARK-17009: Use a new SparkSession for each test case to provide stronger isolation (e.g. config changes in one test case does not impact another). That said, we do not currently isolate catalog changes.\n2. SPARK-17008: Normalize query output using sorting, inspired by HiveComparisonTest.\n\nI also ported a few new test cases over from SQLQuerySuite.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a test harness

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch moves all the test data files in sql/core/src/test/resources to sql/core/src/test/resources/test-data, so we don't clutter the top level

Also deleted sql/core/src/test/resources/old-repeated.parquet since it is no longer used.\n\nThe change will make it easier to spot sql-tests directory.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch introduces a new private ReduceAggregator interface that is a subclass of Aggregator. ReduceAggregator only requires a single associative and commutative reduce function. ReduceAggregator is also used to implement KeyValueGroupedDataset.reduceGroups in order to support partial aggregation.\n\nNote that the pull request was initially done by viirya.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCovered by original tests for reduceGroups, as well as a new test suite for ReduceAggregator.\n","created_at":"2016-08-10T05:48:03Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T08:40:59Z","closed_at":"2016-08-18T08:39:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0af18b9c9c1f5d739086490ec69069cb308d3b1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14576/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14576/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14576/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50ed0d8b39c9305840b326aef034561be487e7c5","head":{"label":"rxin:reduceAggregator","ref":"reduceAggregator","sha":"50ed0d8b39c9305840b326aef034561be487e7c5","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn our cluster, sometimes the sql output maybe overrided. When I submit some sql, all insert into the same table, and the sql will cost less one minute, here is the detail,\n1 sql1, 11:03 insert into table.\n2 sql2, 11:04:11 insert into table.\n3 sql3, 11:04:48 insert into table.\n4 sql4, 11:05 insert into table.\n5 sql5, 11:06 insert into table.\nThe sql3's output file will override the sql2's output file. here is the log:\n\n```\n16/05/04 11:04:11 INFO hive.SparkHiveHadoopWriter: XXfinalPath=hdfs://tl-sng-gdt-nn-tdw.tencent-distribute.com:54310/tmp/assorz/tdw-tdwadmin/20160504/04559505496526517_-1_1204544348/10000/_tmp.p_20160428/attempt_201605041104_0001_m_000000_1\n\n16/05/04 11:04:48 INFO hive.SparkHiveHadoopWriter: XXfinalPath=hdfs://tl-sng-gdt-nn-tdw.tencent-distribute.com:54310/tmp/assorz/tdw-tdwadmin/20160504/04559505496526517_-1_212180468/10000/_tmp.p_20160428/attempt_201605041104_0001_m_000000_1\n\n```\n\nThe reason is the output file use SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyyMMddHHmm\"), if two sql insert into the same table in the same minute, the output will be overrite. I think we should change dateFormat to \"yyyyMMddHHmmss\", in our cluster, we can't finished a sql in one second.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds a code style validation script named `dev/py-validate.sh` to enforce pep8 recommendations.\n\nThe execution of this script will format a lot of files. I did not put them into this PR. I plan to execute this smoothly and reformat the code in various Pull Requests to ease reviews.\n\nFirst one is automatic formatting of the examples in the documentations: See #14830.\n\nFeatures of the current patch:\n- add a `python/.editconfig` file (Scala files use 2 space indentation, while Python files uses 4) for compatible editors (almost every editors has a plugin to support .editconfig file)\n- use `autopep8` to fix basic pep8 mistakes\n- use `isort` to automatically split \"import\" statement and organise them into logically linked order (see doc [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isort#multi-line-output-modes). The most important thing is that it split import statements that imports more than one object into several lines. This will increase the number of line of the file, but this facilitates a lot file maintainance and file merges if needed.\n- add a `py-validate.sh` script in order to automatise the correction (need isort and autopep8 installed inside a virtualenv that has the right version of the tools, this is documented in the script)\n\nYou can see similar script in prod in the [Buildbot](https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/blob/master/common/validate.sh) project\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nSimple tests on my machines has been done (local mode only). There should not have any regression or feature change at all with this pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nOriginally this PR was based on #14491 but I realised that fixing examples are more sensible rather than comments. \n\nThis PR fixes three things below:\n- Fix two wrong examples in `structured-streaming-programming-guide.md`. Loading via `read.load(..)` without `as` will be `Dataset<Row>` not `Dataset<String>` in Java.\n- Fix indentation across `structured-streaming-programming-guide.md`. Python has 4 spaces and Scala and Java have double spaces. These are inconsistent across the examples. \n- Fix `StructuredNetworkWordCountWindowed` and  `StructuredNetworkWordCount` in Java and Scala to initially load `DataFrame` and `Dataset<Row>` to be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `Dataset.show()` prints all the trailing zeros for decimals. For example,\n\n``` scala\nspark.range(11).toDF(\"a\").select('a.cast(DecimalType(30, 20))).show()\n```\n\nprints below:\n\n``` bash\n+--------------------+\n|                   a|\n+--------------------+\n|               0E-20|\n|1.000000000000000...|\n|2.000000000000000...|\n|3.000000000000000...|\n|4.000000000000000...|\n|5.000000000000000...|\n|6.000000000000000...|\n|7.000000000000000...|\n|8.000000000000000...|\n|9.000000000000000...|\n|10.00000000000000...|\n+--------------------+\n```\n\nIt might be confusing, in particular, for `0E-20`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn the PR, we just allow the user to add additional options when create a new table in JDBC writer. \nThe options can be table_options or partition_options.\nE.g., \"CREATE TABLE t (name string) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8\"\n\nHere is the usage example:\n\n```\ndf.write.option(\"createTableOptions\", \"ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis package is meant to be internal, and as a result it does not make sense to mark things as private[sql] or private[spark]. It simply makes debugging harder when Spark developers need to inspect the plans at runtime.\n\nThis patch removes all private[sql] and private[spark] visibility modifiers in org.apache.spark.sql.execution.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A - just visibility

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR contains changes to the Source trait such that the scheduler can notify data sources when it is safe to discard buffered data. Summary of changes:\n- Added a method `commit(end: Offset)` that tells the Source that is OK to discard all offsets up `end`, inclusive.\n- Changed the semantics of a `None` value for the `getBatch` method to mean \"from the very beginning of the stream\"; as opposed to \"all data present in the Source's buffer\".\n- Added notes that the upper layers of the system will never call `getBatch` with a start value less than the last value passed to `commit`.\n- Added a `lastCommittedOffset` method to allow the scheduler to query the status of each Source on restart. This addition is not strictly necessary, but it seemed like a good idea -- Sources will be maintaining their own persistent state, and there may be bugs in the checkpointing code.\n- The scheduler in `StreamExecution.scala` now calls `commit` on its stream sources after marking each batch as complete in its checkpoint.\n- `MemoryStream` now cleans committed batches out of its internal buffer.\n- `TextSocketSource` now cleans committed batches from its internal buffer.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting regression tests already exercise the new code.\n","created_at":"2016-08-09T02:39:01Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T00:35:19Z","closed_at":"2016-10-27T00:35:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2ca1240c2731b24c4a72780e6ae2f314ad8a4c66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0a56e4a25b097dba6f44ad544f83171fbfc3b52a","head":{"label":"frreiss:fred-16963","ref":"fred-16963","sha":"0a56e4a25b097dba6f44ad544f83171fbfc3b52a","user":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61155195,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTE1NTE5NQ==","name":"spark-fred","full_name":"frreiss/spark-fred","private":false,"owner":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss/spark-fred","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n#### TreeBoost\n\nThis change adds TreeBoost functionality to `GBTClassifer` and `GBTRegressor`. The main change is that leaf nodes now make a prediction which optimizes the loss function, rather than always using the mean label (which is only optimal in the case of variance-based impurity).\n#### Changes: L2 and Logistic loss-based impurities\n\nThis changes the defaults to use the loss-based impurity rather than the required variance.\n\nI made this change only for L2 loss and logistic loss (adding some aliases to the names as well for parity with R's implementation, GBM). These two functions have leaf predictions that can be computed within the framework of the current impurity API. Other loss functions will require API modification, which should be its own change, SPARK-16728.\n\nNote that because loss-based impurity with L1 loss is NOT supported, the default behavior for the GBTRegressor is to use the variance-based impurity (since the aformentioned combination throws).\n## How was this patch tested?\n#### Correctness\n\nI tested defaults parameter values and new settings for the parameters with new unit tests.\n#### Accuracy\n\nExample prediction problem with [UCI half of million-song dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YearPredictionMSD). \n\nThis code is a pretty aesthetic change: the only algorithm that differed is the logistic loss one, and the accuracy is identical to that of variance. The difference could only visible in the raw prediction (and thus AUC), since leaf predictions for minimal logistic loss and the mean produced equivalent outcomes after thresholding.\n\nWith 700 trees and 0.001 shrinkage, runtime is nearly equivalent (within 2%) [script and output here](https://gist.github.com/vlad17/c22bb4e6679c9e65fcc3e93a92bd3c30).\n\n[GBM run for comparison](https://gist.github.com/vlad17/eb71cdbcc5e4f1ad891e482a84c8d82b) Everything run on my machine\n","created_at":"2016-08-08T22:14:59Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T17:17:44Z","closed_at":"2017-05-18T08:02:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c89ee227a9e86fa2ed309ca5b1b68c83b8c79f2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14547/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14547/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14547/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4e20a709e9278e18302835070a148f891e42a3c1","head":{"label":"vlad17:GBT-1","ref":"GBT-1","sha":"4e20a709e9278e18302835070a148f891e42a3c1","user":{"login":"vlad17","id":5834964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzQ5NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5834964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17","html_url":"https://github.com/vlad17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45739444,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTczOTQ0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"vlad17/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vlad17","id":5834964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MzQ5NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5834964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17","html_url":"https://github.com/vlad17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlad17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vlad17/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark supports `ordinal` in GROUP BY and ORDER BY.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch introduces a new configuration, `spark.deploy.maxExecutorRetries`, to let users configure an obscure behavior in the standalone master where the master will kill Spark applications which have experienced too many back-to-back executor failures. The current setting is a hardcoded constant (10); this patch replaces that with a new cluster-wide configuration.\n\n**Background:** This application-killing was added in 6b5980da796e0204a7735a31fb454f312bc9daac (from September 2012) and I believe that it was designed to prevent a faulty application whose executors could never launch from DOS'ing the Spark cluster via an infinite series of executor launch attempts. In a subsequent patch (#1360), this feature was refined to prevent applications which have running executors from being killed by this code path.\n\n**Motivation for making this configurable:** Previously, if a Spark Standalone application experienced more than `ApplicationState.MAX_NUM_RETRY` executor failures and was left with no executors running then the Spark master would kill that application, but this behavior is problematic in environments where the Spark executors run on unstable infrastructure and can all simultaneously die. For instance, if your Spark driver runs on an on-demand EC2 instance while all workers run on ephemeral spot instances then it's possible for all executors to die at the same time while the driver stays alive. In this case, it may be desirable to keep the Spark application alive so that it can recover once new workers and executors are available. In order to accommodate this use-case, this patch modifies the Master to never kill faulty applications if `spark.deploy.maxExecutorRetries` is negative.\n\nI'd like to merge this patch into master, branch-2.0, and branch-1.6.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI tested this manually using `spark-shell` and `local-cluster` mode. This is a tricky feature to unit test and historically this code has not changed very often, so I'd prefer to skip the additional effort of adding a testing framework and would rather rely on manual tests and review for now.\n","created_at":"2016-08-08T19:28:01Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T20:37:05Z","closed_at":"2016-08-09T18:24:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"56edd0cb58a5a7a35fe0790aea701b0640fffd7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14544/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14544/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14544/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef3297d374d34a3f5d55f83d2968e836b7e0b5d4","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:add-setting-for-max-executor-failures","ref":"add-setting-for-max-executor-failures","sha":"ef3297d374d34a3f5d55f83d2968e836b7e0b5d4","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

are two narrow races that could cause the ApplicationMaster to miss\nwhen the user application instantiates the SparkContext, which could cause\napp failures when nothing was wrong with the app. It was also possible for\na failing application to get stuck in the loop that waits for the context\nfor a long time, instead of failing quickly.\n\nThe change uses a promise to track the SparkContext instance, which gets\nrid of the races and allows for some simplification of the code.\n\nTested with existing unit tests, and a new one being added to test the\ntimeout

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nInline tables were added in to Spark SQL in 2.0, e.g.: `select * from values (1, 'A'), (2, 'B') as tbl(a, b)`\n\nThis is currently implemented using a `LocalRelation` and this relation is created during parsing. This has a weakness: type coercion is based on the first row in the relation, and all subsequent values are cast in to this type. The latter violates the principle of least surprise.\n\nThis PR fixes this by creating a dedicated `InlineTable` node. Type coercion now follows the rules for `Union`, which is similar to other systems like PostgreSQL. In order to retain optimal speed, I have extended the `ConvertToLocalRelation`, which makes sure the table gets rewritten into a `LocalRelation` during optimization.\n\nThe following SQL statement:\n\n``` SQL\nselect * from values (1, exp(1)), (2.00, 'b'), (3.0, 'tt'), (40.0001, 4) x(a, b)\n```\n\n... now yields the following plan:\n\n```\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\n'Project [*]\n+- 'SubqueryAlias x\n   +- 'InlineTable [ArrayBuffer(1 AS a#0, 'exp(1) AS b#1), ArrayBuffer(2.00 AS a#2, b AS b#3), ArrayBuffer(3.0 AS a#4, tt AS b#5), ArrayBuffer(40.0001 AS a#6, 4 AS b#7)]\n\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\n1 AS a#0: decimal(14,4), EXP(cast(1 as double)) AS b#1: string\nProject [1 AS a#0#18, EXP(cast(1 as double)) AS b#1#19]\n+- SubqueryAlias x\n   +- InlineTable [ArrayBuffer(cast(1 as decimal(14,4)) AS 1 AS a#0#18, cast(EXP(cast(1 as double)) as string) AS EXP(cast(1 as double)) AS b#1#19), ArrayBuffer(cast(2.00 as decimal(14,4)) AS 2.00 AS a#2#20, b AS b#3), ArrayBuffer(cast(3.0 as decimal(14,4)) AS 3.0 AS a#4#21, tt AS b#5), ArrayBuffer(cast(40.0001 as decimal(14,4)) AS 40.0001 AS a#6#22, cast(4 as string) AS 4 AS b#7#23)]\n\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nLocalRelation [1 AS a#0#18, EXP(cast(1 as double)) AS b#1#19]\n\n== Physical Plan ==\nLocalTableScan [1 AS a#0#18, EXP(cast(1 as double)) AS b#1#19]\n```\n\n... and the following result:\n\n```\n+-------+-----------------+\n|      a|                b|\n+-------+-----------------+\n| 1.0000|2.718281828459045|\n| 2.0000|                b|\n| 3.0000|               tt|\n|40.0001|                4|\n+-------+-----------------+\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI have updated the `PlanParseSuite` to test the parsers the new output, and I have added tests to the `ConvertToLocalRelationSuite` to tests if inline table (a-like) structures are converted into `LocalRelation`s. I still need to add tests for the `TypeCoercion` and `CheckAnalysis`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt seems `approxCountDistinct`, `toDegrees` and `toRadians` are also missed while matching the names to the ones in `FunctionRegistry`.

For `countDistinct` and `sumDistinct`, they are not registered in `FunctionRegistry`.\n\nThis PR deprecates `approxCountDistinct`, `toDegrees` and `toRadians` and introduces `approx_count_distinct`, `degrees` and `radians`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should cover

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn HiveContext, if saveAsTable[append] has different number of columns, Spark will throw Exception.\ne.g.\n\n```\n    test(\"saveAsTable[append]: too many columns\") {\n      withTable(\"saveAsTable_too_many_columns\") {\n        Seq((1, 2)).toDF(\"i\", \"j\").write.saveAsTable(\"saveAsTable_too_many_columns\")\n        val e =

assert(e.getMessage.contains(\"doesn't match\"))\n      }\n    }\n\n```\n\nHowever, in SparkSession or SQLContext, if use the above code example, the extra column in the append data will be removed silently without any warning or Exception. The table becomes\n\n```\ni j\n3 4\n1 2\n\n```\n\nI changed the code to throw Exception  if saveAsTable[apend] has different column numbers\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe existing `CREATE TABLE LIKE` command has multiple issues:\n- The generated table is non-empty when the source table is a data source table. The major reason is the data source table is using the table property `path` to store the location of table contents. Currently, we keep it unchanged. Thus, we still create the same table with the same location.\n- The table type of the generated table is `EXTERNAL` when the source table is an external Hive Serde table. Currently, we explicitly set it to `MANAGED`, but Hive is checking the table property `EXTERNAL` to decide whether the table is `EXTERNAL` or not. (See https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/ObjectStore.java#L1407-L1408) Thus, the created table is still `EXTERNAL`. \n- When the source table is a `VIEW`, the metadata of the generated table contains the original view text and view original text. So far, this does not break anything, but it could cause something wrong in Hive. (For example, https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/ObjectStore.java#L1405-L1406)\n- The issue regarding the table `comment`. To follow what Hive does, the table comment should be cleaned, but the column comments should be still kept.\n- The `INDEX` table is not supported. Thus, we should throw an exception in this case. \n- `owner` should not be retained. `ToHiveTable` set it [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e679bc3c1cd418ef0025d2ecbc547c9660cac433/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L793) no matter which value we set in `CatalogTable`. We set it to an empty string for avoiding the confusing output in Explain.\n- Add a support for temp tables\n- Like Hive, we should not copy the table properties from the source table to the created table, especially for the statistics-related properties, which could be wrong in the created table.\n- `unsupportedFeatures` should not be copied from the source table. The created table does not have these unsupported features.\n- When the type of source table is a view, the target table is using the default format of data source tables: `spark.sql.sources.default`.\n\nThis PR is to fix the above issues. \n### How was this patch tested?\n\nImprove the test coverage by adding more test cases\n","created_at":"2016-08-08T04:29:53Z","updated_at":"2016-10-16T04:47:53Z","closed_at":"2016-09-01T08:38:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01342fe8c52d5051965388fd25e506a9d4714a21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14531/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14531/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14531/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4bcb306b3a3801e1bc76be14487e097c0c517b8f","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:createTableLike","ref":"createTableLike","sha":"4bcb306b3a3801e1bc76be14487e097c0c517b8f","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

Currently, it does not remove them correctly if the arguments are string types.\n\n**Reported Scenarios**\n\n``` scala\nscala> val dfa = Seq((1, 2), (2, 3)).toDF(\"id\", \"a\").alias(\"dfa\")\nscala> val dfb = Seq((1, 0), (1, 1)).toDF(\"id\", \"b\").alias(\"dfb\")\nscala> dfa.join(dfb, dfa(\"id\") === dfb(\"id\")).dropDuplicates(Array(\"dfa.id\", \"dfb.id\"))\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Cannot resolve column name \"dfa.id\" among (id, a, id, b);\n```\n\nHere is the same result on [Databricks CE / Spark 2.0](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/6660119172909095/3193434347349241/5162191866050912/latest.html).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins tests with a newly added test case.\n","created_at":"2016-08-07T23:33:32Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T07:02:52Z","closed_at":"2016-10-10T02:25:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6400725399d1901f46739974142c3efb7c3b69c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/67ea92448463c559ef9650eead719f69b5f3b51b","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-16938","ref":"SPARK-16938","sha":"67ea92448463c559ef9650eead719f69b5f3b51b","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"72eec70bdbf6fb67c977463db5d8d95dd3040ae8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache Spark -
