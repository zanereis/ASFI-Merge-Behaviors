Marcus Sorensen <mls@apple.com>\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR Fixes #6739 (for PowerFlex/ScaleIO only, Datera still needs to be addressed), which can occur if the last host the VM ran on is deleted from CloudStack. At the point the VM is deleted, cloudstack attempts to make a final call to revoke access to volumes, passing the last host the VM ran on. If this host is gone, we get an error and are unable to delete the VM.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that there may be a more holistic fix to this by identifying all of the places where `revokeAccess()` is called and checking for null host. It's possible other storage plugins don't even need host information to revoke access to volumes and may need this call to revoke. Therefore I'm only applying this fix to the ScaleIOPrimaryDataStoreDriver to skip revoking access when there is no host to revoke access for, and this should protect us as well when a new part of the code tries to use `revokeAccess()` in the future.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested in a local branch against PowerFlex primary storage, and with internal testing environments. Repeated steps outlined in #6739.

Description\r\n\r\nFixes: #6718 \r\n\r\nChanges the default behavior of conntrackd to stop logging verbose conntrack-ed traffic to /var/log/daemon.log. This is expensive in terms of performance and also costly in terms of the limited disk capacity in a VR. In cases of large quantities of traffic, /var fills up and causes the VR to either stop passing traffic or perform necessary tasks in the VPC.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nChange applied to opt/cloud/templates/conntrackd.conf.templ in systemvm.iso inside of cloud-scripts.tgz.  systemvm.iso distributed to all Cloudstack KVM hosts and placed at /usr/share/cloudstack-common/vms/systemvm.iso.

Description\r\n\r\nFIX #6673\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the catch block with the `e.printStackTrace()`, which suppressed the Exceptions to be thrown in the CI\\CD's final report.\r\n<!--- Describe your

-->\r\nThese catch blocks will only print the the Exception information and will not raise any failure in the testing process. This behavior will lead the developer harder to notice the issue in the CI\\CD reports.\r\n\r\nI suggest removing the try-catch structure and adding some additional assertion(if possible). This will improve the readability of the test cases, and avoid missing the test failure. Even if the exception does not raise by the component that we are testing here, we can still know that we need to fix the outside conditions first to make sure the test case running under stable and consistent conditions.\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to fix a problem with a privately backported feature. The columns added for the feature are not added idem potent so people can not backport them. I propose that all DB alteration from here on in will be done with the `IDEM_POTENT_...()` set of stored procedures that we have to prevent these kind of issues for users.\r\n\r\nSo far this has only been done with one feature but I propose to regirously do this for all code.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new

Marcus Sorensen <mls@apple.com>\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows the cloud admin to set either a global or domain-specific value \"metadata.allow.expose.domain\", and when set this allows the VM to see the name and ID of the immediate domain that contains the VM in instance metadata. This can be useful or a variety of things such as bootstrapping VM configuration and access according to domain.\r\n\r\nThis PR also deletes the CloudZonesNetworkElement because it isn't referred to anywhere, and there was initially some confusion as to whether this code needed to be updated when extending metadata.  If it needs to be kept we can remove that delete from the PR.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[root@test-vm ~]# cloud-init query ds.meta_data.cloud_domain\r\nmydomain\r\n\r\n[root@test-vm ~]# cloud-init query ds.meta_data.cloud_domain_id\r\ne41e92fa-0498-4e76-b4b3-5948a44a9309\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTested in a local branch, released to an internal UAT environment for a few weeks. Also updated metadata Marvin test.\r\n\r\nTested both setting \"metadata.allow.expose.domain\" true and false, and going back and forth.

Description\r\nIs currently a POC, if someone have additional ideas or hints.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nUsers sometimes only have the option to use local storages, so they should have the option to use local storage like other storage types.\r\n\r\n**Implementation**\r\nDecided to use already existing code to prevent breaks in current behavior(adapted agent code by user to add local storage)\r\nWith this implementation it is possible to add and use local storage like other storage types. \r\n\r\n**Key properties to add a local storage**\r\nScope: HOST\r\nProtocol: Filesytem\r\nPath: mount path in KVM\r\n\r\n**Condition:** \r\nEnable local storage for User VMs = true in zone detail settings\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed.

Description\r\n\r\nFixes #6680\r\n\r\nWhile finding CPU speed for KVM host following methods will be used in the same order:\r\n1. lscpu\r\n2. value in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/base_frequency\r\n3. libvirt host capabilities\r\n4. libvirt nodeinfo\r\n\r\nThis will allow the correct value for AMD-based hosts when the first two methods don't give a value\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR  addresses parallel resource allocation as a generalization of the problem and solution described in #6644. Instead of the Global lock on the resources a reservation record is created which is added in the resource check count in the `ResourceLimitService`/`ResourceLimitManagerImpl`.  As a convenience a `CheckedReservation` is created. This is an implementation of `AutoClosable` and can be used as a guard in a try-with-resource fashion. The close method of the `CheckedReservation` wil delete the reservation record.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: #

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the API `quotaEmailTemplateUpdate` escapes JavaScript strings in the email templates for the `subject` and `body` fields. However, when using the API `quotaEmailTemplateList` the data returned were not unescaped, causing inconsistencies in the text. This PR aims to fix this behavior by removing the escape method in the API `quotaEmailTemplateUpdate` as it was unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab by changing the email templates in the `subject` and `body` field with special characters.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix the current behavior of the `min_balance` parameter of the `quotaCredits` API. This parameter is considered optional in the API documentation; however, when using the API, it is not possible to add credits without specifying the minimum balance for the account. Therefore, this behavior was fixed. If the minimum balance is not specified it is considered as 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab using the API `quotaCredits` without specifying the `min_balance` field.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, ACS only has the option to enable the Quota plugin globally. However, for some use cases having the plugin active to specific accounts and domains may be more interesting. Therefore, this PR aims to add this functionality through the quota config `quota.account.enabled`. Moreover, a new column was added to the quota summary section in the UI showing if the account has the plugin enabled. In the future, a filter will be added for accounts with the plugin enabled, disabled and for removed accounts.\r\n\r\nFinally, for the config to be used in a domain scope, when it cannot be found at user level, it is required that the following global configurations are enabled: `enable.account.settings.for.domain` and `enable.domain.settings.for.child.domain`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nList of accounts with the plugin enabled and disabled:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/197795357-9f0e814b-5e8d-464b-aca0-ecc38da72a9f.png)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab setting the `quota.account.enabled` to true and false to random accounts.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the ACS has a lot of API call with unsupported parameters. While this does not cause any problems, as any unsupported parameters are discarded, there are a lot of messages with similar content: `WARN ... Received unknown parameters for command listZones. Unknown parameters : listall`. Therefore, it can be confusing for beginner operators. Moreover, if the API does not support the parameter, it should not be used regardless.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab traversing the UI while monitoring the Management logs if there were any `WARN ...

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the `listRouters` and `listSystemVms` APIs to make them return the VM's root volume ID. So that in the future the UI may be extended to use the `findStoragePoolsForMigration` to migrate VRs and System VMs.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n####

(if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab, by calling the APIs through Cloudmonkey and checking if the VM's root volume ID was being correctly returned.\r\nSome unit tests were also added.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-29T19:09:59Z","updated_at":"2022-09-21T16:45:35Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T16:45:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be782c495c35d1c1f589a870fa8fb698d6c7c68f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6685/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6685/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/6685/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/b2c739d931eed97a733bd90f13750a9f284e75f4","head":{"label":"scclouds:return-root-uuid","ref":"return-root-uuid","sha":"b2c739d931eed97a733bd90f13750a9f284e75f4","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve the user experience upon creation of Network Offerings warning the user of the scenarios in which a VR is created. For this, the service offering field is always shown in the form and a warning message is displayed if the user's configuration does not require the creation of a VR. These scenarios include a network offering with guest type L2, and a with a guest type Shared or Isolated when none of the following services are enabled: (VPN, DHCP, DNS, Firewall, LB, UserData, SourceNat, StaticNat and/or PortForwarding). Finally, the message for the Isolated and Shared networks disappear when one of the aforementioned services are selected.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\nMessage if the guest type is **Isolated or Shared**:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/187272985-65a3715e-36eb-406f-a8e6-ae0d89dc7eb4.png)\r\n  \r\nMessage if the guest type is **L2**:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42067040/187273080-d6185ad5-46e1-49d0-afd0-25a5f2de3a71.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab using the networking offering form. The message for Shared/Isolated type was only displayed if the none of the following services (VPN, DHCP, DNS, Firewall, LB, UserData, SourceNat, StaticNat and/or PortForwarding) were not selected.\r\nFor the L2 message, it was always displayed, unless the guest type was changed.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-29T18:53:23Z","updated_at":"2022-10-09T09:51:41Z","closed_at":"2022-10-09T09:51:41Z","merged_at":"2022-10-09T09:51:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"0535d9b5e1aa8449638ccb4c813233f3e521f195","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23/labels","id":7233557,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AbmAV","number":23,"title":"4.18.0.0","description":"released","creator":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":323,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T08:55:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T07:59:31Z","due_on":"2023-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T18:50:04Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6684/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6684/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/6684/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/02092d899a14e1437e38d5f11a7cd09b1c6ce0ab","head":{"label":"scclouds:more-intuitive-service-offering-on-network-offering-creation","ref":"more-intuitive-service-offering-on-network-offering-creation","sha":"02092d899a14e1437e38d5f11a7cd09b1c6ce0ab","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR extends PR #6051 by making the `listVirtualMachines` API return the VMs' userdata, so that when the editVM form is opened in the UI, the existing userdata will be shown. \r\nA new optional boolean parameter called `userdata` was added to the `listVirtualMachines` API, that controls whether the API should return userdata or not. The default value is false.\r\nThe `sanitizeReverse` function was also moved to util.js to prevent duplicated code.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![userdata](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48719461/187267645-41632076-52a3-45ba-a5e3-31d0028d4e14.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis was tested in a local lab by creating a new VM and editing it's userdata through the UI.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to build new functionality\r\n<!--- Creation of ReadyForShutdown api and PrepareForShutdown api. The ReadyForShutdown api checks across the cloudstack whether it is ready for shutdown or not by monitoring completion of pending asynchronous jobs, and further returns true or false -->\r\nIf true safeshutdown will be triggered; if false completion will be awaited and system will be prepared for shutdown with the help of PrepareForShutdown api, this will not only monitor in_progress asynchronous jobs and wait for its completion and prevent addition of new asynchronous jobs.\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure a user can not create multiple VMs at once thus going passed their resource limit. For this purpose the part between the resource limit check and the commit of the VM has been put in a synchronized method. Also a GlobalLock is created. The problem with this is that\r\n1. a lot of regression tests fail\r\n2. users may rely on massive parallel creation of VMs\r\nTo guarantee backwards compatability, a setting has been introduced, `allow.user.parallel.vm.creation`, the defauklt is true to allow for the old behaviour, but this is deemed harmful from a quota point of view. If set to false the initial creation of a VM is not done in parallel and the limits are observed.\r\nNOTE: this only affects the creation of the VM object including any needed resources. It is not synchronising the actual deployment.\r\nNOTE: the test included in the code only tests the case where all VM creations are atempted on one MS. the multiple MS test is manual for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nprereqs:\r\n- env with three MSs\r\n- a domain with a limit of 2 user VMs\r\n- an account in that domain with `allow.user.parallel.vm.creation` set to `false`\r\n- a cmk install with preofiles `first`, `second` and `thiird` pointing to the different MSs\r\n- \r\ntest script:\r\n```\r\nfor i in 1 2 3\r\n  do\r\n    cmk -p first deploy virtualmachine templateid=aed902af-0d71-4fd3-b767-32bdb0edc7f2 zoneid=33c25232-a25b-459b-812f-0e81ff8eded0 serviceofferingid=24dd5f48-4ee2-4ebb-9375-3cf882fa1b00 &\r\n  done\r\nfor i in 1 2 3\r\n  do\r\n    cmk -p second deploy virtualmachine templateid=aed902af-0d71-4fd3-b767-32bdb0edc7f2 zoneid=33c25232-a25b-459b-812f-0e81ff8eded0 serviceofferingid=24dd5f48-4ee2-4ebb-9375-3cf882fa1b00 &  done ; for i in 1 2 3 ; do cmk -p third deploy virtualmachine templateid=aed902af-0d71-4fd3-b767-32bdb0edc7f2 zoneid=33c25232-a25b-459b-812f-0e81ff8eded0 serviceofferingid=24dd5f48-4ee2-4ebb-9375-3cf882fa1b00 & done\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-16T07:55:56Z","updated_at":"2022-09-12T09:53:14Z","closed_at":"2022-09-12T09:52:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ac0e1c013c312a29360b1d26a7e78e587698175","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR provides constructors and the associated changes to use LibvirtVMDef for creating user mode network interfaces.\r\n\r\nWhile this isn't used directly in the CloudStack KVM agent today, it could be used in the future for e.g. pod networking/management networks without needing to assign a pod IP. The VIF driver used by the CloudStack Agent is also pluggable, so this allows plugin code to create user mode network interfaces as well.\r\n\r\nNote that the user mode network already exists in the GuestNetType enum, but wasn't usable prior to this change.\r\n\r\nAlso included unit test to ensure we continue to create the expected XML.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this uncovered a null pointer on `_networkRateKBps` and this PR fixes it. The decision to add bandwidth throttling assumes this field is not null and simply checks for `> 0`.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nUnit tests.

Description\r\n\r\nACS + Xenserver works with differential snapshots. ACS takes a volume full snapshot and the next ones are referenced as a child of the previous snapshot until the chain reaches the limit defined in the global setting `snapshot.delta.max`; then, a new full snapshot is taken. PR #5297 introduced disk-only snapshots for KVM volumes. Among the changes, the delete process was also refactored. Before the changes, when one was removing a snapshot with children, ACS was marking it as `Destroyed` and it was keeping the `Image` entry on the table `cloud.snapshot_store_ref` as `Ready`. When ACS was rotating the snapshots (the max delta was reached) and all the children were already marked as removed; then, ACS would start removing the whole hierarchy, completing the differential snapshot cycle. After the changes, the snapshots with children stopped being marked as removed and the differential snapshot cycle was not being completed.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to honor again the differential snapshot cycle for XenServer, making the snapshots to be marked as removed when deleted while having children and following the differential snapshot cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, when one takes a volume snapshot and ACS backs it up to the secondary storage, ACS inserts 2 entries on table `cloud.snapshot_store_ref` (`Primary` and `Image`). When one deletes a volume snapshot, ACS first tries to remove the snapshot from the secondary storage and mark the entry `Image` as removed; then, it tries to remove the snapshot from the primary storage and mark the entry `Primary` as removed. If ACS cannot remove the snapshot from the primary storage, it will keep the snapshot as `BackedUp`; however, If it does not exist in the secondary storage and without the entry `SNAPSHOT.DELETE` on `cloud.usage_event`. In the end, after the garbage collector flow, the snapshot will be marked as `BackedUp`, with a value in the field `removed` and still being rated. This PR also addresses the correction for this situation.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThe situation was observed in XenServer environments; however, due to some internal circumstances, I had to reproduce the situation in a KVM environment (considering 2 as max deltas).\r\n\r\nI created a VM and scheduled an hourly snapshot for the `ROOT` volume, retaining 2 snapshots. After ACS take the first two snapshots (and before taking the third one), I manually changed the database to put the ID of the first snapshot as the parent of the second, to simulate the XenServer differential snapshot. After the third snapshot was generated, the first one was marked as `Destroyed`, ACS generated the entry `SNAPSHOT.DELETE` on `cloud.usage_event`, and the entries `Primary` and `Image` ended up as `Destroyed` and `Ready`, respectively. After the fourth snapshot was generated, ACS identified that the second one was the last on the hierarchy and started removing the hierarchy. In the end, the entries for the first and second snapshots were marked as removed and only the last 2 snapshots got entries in `Ready` state.\r\n\r\nI also forced errors in the deletion of the snapshot in the primary and secondary storage. At the end of both tests, ACS inserted the entries `SNAPSHOT.DELETE` on `cloud.usage_event` and the garbage collector removed the entries of the `cloud.snapshot_store_ref`.","created_at":"2022-08-10T21:05:08Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T13:22:05Z","closed_at":"2022-10-13T07:01:12Z","merged_at":"2022-10-13T07:01:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"7936eb04e9bbdd89bafdf7bdf60393ea00bde61c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"GabrielBrascher","id":5025148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5025148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBrascher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBrascher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"slavkap","id":51903378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTAzMzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51903378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap","html_url":"https://github.com/slavkap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavkap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23/labels","id":7233557,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AbmAV","number":23,"title":"4.18.0.0","description":"released","creator":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":323,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T08:55:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T07:59:31Z","due_on":"2023-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T18:50:04Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/6630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/5e268ce08096d15ce85df850b560f494fd51b0c8","head":{"label":"scclouds:fix-delete-parent-snapshot","ref":"fix-delete-parent-snapshot","sha":"5e268ce08096d15ce85df850b560f494fd51b0c8","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","g

Description\r\n\r\nWhen restoring and attaching a backup volume, the UI waits for the successfful response of the API to close the formulary. However, letting the form open after sending the command can confuse users, that might try to send the command again.\r\n\r\nNote: other formularies (like volume or snapshot creation) always are closed after sending the command to the backend.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we intend to close the formulary right after sending the command, as done with others.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested in a local lab.\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, I tried to restore and attach a backup volume. After clicking the button `Ok`, the command was sent, but the formulary was kept open. After the changes, when clicking the button `Ok`, the command is sent and the formulary is closed.","created_at":"2022-08-02T16:55:54Z","updated_at":"2022-08-03T10:50:24Z","closed_at":"2022-08-03T10:50:24Z","merged_at":"2022-08-03T10:50:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"d4d310c790e32484389b05e88e2960f71fbde3f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/23/labels","id":7233557,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AbmAV","number":23,"title":"4.18.0.0","description":"released","creator":{"login":"DaanHoogland","id":2486961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODY5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland","html_url":"https://github.com/DaanHoogland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DaanHoogland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":323,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T08:55:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T07:59:31Z","due_on":"2023-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T18:50:04Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/6603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/6603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/bdf26e4f0bb16a692351b64d7447a818b01605bc","head":{"label":"scclouds:close-restore-backup-form-on-button-action","ref":"close-restore-backup-form-on-button-action","sha":"bdf26e4f0bb16a692351b64d7447a818b01605bc","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMWare hypervisor, with the Veeam plugin active, it is not possible to remove the VM from its Backup Offering without removing its backups. To resolve this limitation, a new parameter has been added to the `removeVirtualMachineFromBackupOffering` API to allow users to disable the job but keep Veeam backups. So, when removing a VM from a Backup Offering, it is possible to pass the forced parameter to true, which will remove the job and the backups. Otherwise, the job will just be disabled and the backups will be kept.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I created a new VM and attached this VM to a Backup Offering;\r\n2. I make some manual backups;\r\n3. I removed this VM from the backup offering, without using the `force` option as false, and checked if, in Veeam, the job was still there, in the disabled state, and if the backups were still stored too;\r\n4. I repeat this process, but using true in `force` option and check if the backups and job are deleted in Veeam.

Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMWare hypervisor, with the Veeam plugin active, ACS tries to find, in Veeam, VBRViDatastore using the UUID of this storage in ACS, and VBRServer using the IP of the host in ACS. But, in some scenarios, the VBRViDatastore/VBRServer, in Veeam, can use the name of this component, which causes an exception in ACS. This PR aims to fix this behavior, improving the search of VBRViDatastore and VBRServer by using the name.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I added new storage and host in my lab, and make sure the component, in Veeam, are identified by their names;\r\n2. I created a VM (the volume is in the new storage, and VM is in the new host) and added this VM to a backup offering;\r\n3. I make some manual backups;\r\n4.

Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMWare hypervisor, with the Veeam plugin active, it is not possible to attach or detach volumes on VMs attached in a Backup Offering.

Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMWare hypervisor, with the Veeam plugin active, it is not possible to remove backups. Instead, an exception is thrown in ACS, and the only procedure that allows the removal of backups is to remove the VM from the Backup Offering, which causes all backups for that VM to be removed.\r\n\r\nThrough Veeam's documentation and user forum, it was discovered that it does not allow the removal of specific restore points. Instead, the entire backup chain is removed, leaving only the job in Veeam.\r\n\r\nTo address this limitation, a new parameter has been added to the `deleteBackup` API to allow users to remove the complete Veeam backup chain. So, when removing a backup, users can pass the `forced` parameter as `true`, to remove all the backup chain, but keeping the VM in the Backup Offering. Otherwise, an exception will be thrown notifying the user of this Veeam limitation and the `forced` option.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local lab:\r\n\r\n1. I created a new VM and attached this VM to a Backup Offering;\r\n2. I performed two manual backups;\r\n3. I attempted (using CLI) to delete one of these backups;\r\n4. Before, an exception was thrown, forcing the user to remove the VM from Backup Offering;\r\n5.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the vm autoscaling feature to support CloudStack Virtual router as LB provider\r\n\r\nThe following changes need be considered\r\n- support cloudstack virtual routers and vpc vrs as LB provider\r\n- get network/load balancer metrics from virtual routers\r\n- UI changes to create/update/remove vm groups\r\n- support more vm properties (sshkey, affinity group, userdata networks, etc)\r\n- support main hypervisors (kvm, vmware, xenserver/xcp)\r\n\r\nsome changes are good to have but not considered for now\r\n- remove load balancing from autoscaling\r\n- support networks without load balancing (e.g. shared networks)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE:

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, ACS does not have a feature to manage user password policies. New domain-scoped settings were created to allow operators to define password policies. Configured password policies will be applied whenever a user changes their password or a new user is created. The following settings were created:\r\n\r\n| Setting | Purpose |\r\n| ------ | ------ |\r\n|`password.policy.minimum.length`| Minimum password length |\r\n|`password.policy.minimum.lowercase.letters`| Minimum number of lower case letters|\r\n|`password.policy.minimum.uppercase.letters`| Minimum number of upper case letters|\r\n|`password.policy.minimum.special.characters`| Minimum number of special characters|\r\n|`password.policy.minimum.digits`| Minimum number of digits|\r\n|`password.policy.allowPasswordToContainUsername`| If the password may contain the user's username|\r\n|`password.policy.regex`| A regular expression that the password must match|\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were created for the new methods. Furthermore each configuration was individually tested in the ROOT domain. The creation of a user was tested, to ensure that verification of password policies was being called. All other tests were done by changing the user's password via the UI.\r\n\r\n| No. | Test | Result | Expected result? |\r\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| 1 |
