issue resolved #1622 \r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nThe `PORT` env var is used by Vue dev server. I only defined a new env var `FUSEKI_PORT`. The default values are the same, `8080` and `3030`.\r\n\r\nIn `pom.xml` for the Jena Fuseki UI module a Maven plug-in is used to allocate two network ports (it will search two free) and define Maven properties. In the Maven Frontend plug-in, these environment variables are then used to define `PORT` and `FUSEKI_PORT`.\r\n\r\nI tested by starting `python3 -m http.server 3030` in one terminal, `watch -n 2 netstat -tlnp` in another, and then running `mvn test` in the Jena Fuseki UI module folder.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-11-19

as a less invasive first step related to #1616\r\n\r\nAdds a new ARQ symbol `optPathFlattenExtended` that allows enabling more comprehensive path flattened transform via existing code `TransformPathFlatternStd`.  When enabled this is used in preference to the existing simpler path flattening transform.\r\n\r\nThis remains disabled by default as it can generate algebra structures that are less performant for the general case.  However users might have use cases that benefit from this so this now allows opting into it without needing deeper modification of ARQs optimiser.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n

improved: GH-1614\r\n\r\n- the GraphUtils.allNodes used in the worst case determineUngroundedStartingSet was previously computing the contents of the whole data set. this has two drawbacks, (1) not lazy (2) not easy to abort, i.e queryTimeout was not respected\r\n\r\n  changed it to Iter.distinct (unfortunately that means in worst case it will still require to load everything into memory)\r\n\r\n- the `PathLib.execUngroundedPath` and `execUngroundedPathSameVar` were both consuming the iterator fully while creating new QueryIterConcats. Drawbacks are the same as above, additionally LIMIT could not be pushed down.

href=\"https://github.com/jython/jython/blob/master/NEWS\">jython-standalone's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Jython 2.7.3</h1>\n<p>New Features</p>\n<pre><code>- The jython command respects the PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE environment\n  variable ([GH-128](https://github.com/jython/jython/issues/128)).\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Under PR <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/101\">GH-101</a>, the matching of sequence arguments to the parameters of\nJava methods is improved (and in constructors under <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/201\">GH-201</a>). A Java\nvarargs parameter does not match a final sequence in the call if an array\nparameter could do so. (Thanks Peter Holloway.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>array.array itemsize of unsigned types is now the same as their signed\ncounterparts, where previously it was mostly double. Internal\nrepresentations have changed. Anomalies have been eliminated between\nitemsize and the serialisation (tostring() etc.) for unsigned types, and\nin the range of values accepted in different contexts. The size of type\n'u' (unicode character) is 4 on all platforms. Client code that was\nworking around these anomalies may have to change. Overall, the\nexperience should be closer to that with CPython.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We no longer aspire to compile Jython with Java 7. (We may use Java 8\nfeatures.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The project has moved its home to GitHub (twice), and invites issue\nreports there (not at bugs.jython.org).\n</code></pre></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jython 2.7.3\nThe release is the same as the rc1 (apart from the version number).</p>\n<p>Jython 2.7.3rc1 Bugs fixed\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/201\">GH-201</a> ] Support vararg constructors</p>\n<p>Jython 2.7.3b1 Bugs fixed\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/192\">GH-192</a> ] PyString with non-byte value in formatting of collections\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/183\">GH-183</a> ] Console messages do not reach root logger (bjo 2896)\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/178\">GH-178</a> ] Update icu4j JAR to 71.1\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/177\">GH-177</a> ] Update Ant to 1.10.12 (Gradle build) (CVE-2020-1945, 2021-36374)\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/160\">GH-160</a> ] Improve context of &quot;Cannot create PyString with non-byte value&quot;\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/159\">GH-159</a> ] Non-byte PyString error during initialisation in Turkish locale\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/158\">GH-158</a> ] Upgrade Bouncy Castle to 1.71\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/157\">GH-157</a> ] Upgrade ASM to 9.3\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/156\">GH-156</a> ] Replace custom SHA224 digest with Java's\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/151\">GH-151</a> ] Upgrade Apache Xerces to 2.12.2 (CVE-2022-23437)\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/150\">GH-150</a> ] Upgrade Netty to 4.1.73 (various CVEs)\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/138\">GH-138</a> ] Upgrade Guava to 31.0.1 (CVE-2020-8908)\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/139\">GH-139</a> ] Make gradlew executable on Unix/Mac\n- [ <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jython/jython/issues/136\">GH-136</a> ] Use full path of cmd.exe (CVE-2019-17664)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

on from #1486  (Javadoc cleaning to get the build working for Java11, not cross-compiled)\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nThis PR has fixes and settings so the javadoc:javadoc goal can be source=11.\r\nOtherwise, we have an implicit restriction that the source code must be Java8 syntax. The case that bit me was private methods interfaces.\r\n\r\ndoclint is still set to \"none\" but with Java17 running maven, the setting \"<doclint>syntax,html,reference\" work.\r\n\r\nThere are still some warnings like:\r\n```\r\n[WARNING] javadoc: warning - The code being documented uses packages in the unnamed module, but the packages defined in https://jena.apache.org/documentation/javadoc/rdfconnection/ are in named modules.\r\n```\r\nbut they don't stop the build and seem to bee Java17 to make them go away.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nBy submitting

request Description:\r\n\r\nThis cleans the code so that `<doclint>syntax,html` is clean except: jena-iri and jena-core which ave some large HTML tables which doclint does not like but seem valid, albeit old HTML. \r\n\r\nBut.\r\n\r\nThe top level is set to `<doclint>none` because while Java17 passes, Java11 checks the \"missing\" category (despite not being asked to) and also rejects `<br/>`.\r\n\r\nThe Jena release is currently using Java17 compiling for Java11 because the javadoc search fails.\r\n\r\nBut we ought to ensure that java11 does build Jena as we support Java11.\r\n\r\n----\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I acknowledge that I am making a contribution to the Apache Software Foundation under the terms and conditions of the [Contributor's
