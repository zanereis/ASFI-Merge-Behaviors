What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport stage-level scheduling for some PySpark DataFrame APIs (mapInPandas and mapInArrow).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe introduction of barrier mode in Spark, as seen in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40520, allows for the implementation of Spark ML cases (pure Python algorithms) using DataFrame APIs such as mapInPandas and mapInArrow, so it's necessary to enable stage-level scheduling for DataFrame APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, This PR adds a new argument \"profile\" for mapInPandas and mapInArrow.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\ndef mapInPandas(\r\n    self, func: \"PandasMapIterFunction\",\r\n        schema: Union[StructType, str],\r\n        barrier: bool = False,\r\n        profile: Optional[ResourceProfile] = None,\r\n) -> \"DataFrame\":\r\n\r\ndef mapInArrow(\r\n    self, func: \"ArrowMapIterFunction\",\r\n        schema: Union[StructType, str],\r\n        barrier: bool = False,\r\n        profile: Optional[ResourceProfile] = None,\r\n) -> \"DataFrame\":\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to use it? take mapInPandas as an example,\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nfrom pyspark import TaskContext\r\ndef func(iterator):\r\n    tc = TaskContext.get()\r\n    assert tc.cpus() == 3\r\n    for batch in iterator:\r\n        yield batch\r\ndf = spark.range(10)\r\n\r\nfrom pyspark.resource import TaskResourceRequests, ResourceProfileBuilder\r\ntreqs = TaskResourceRequests().cpus(3)\r\nrp = ResourceProfileBuilder().require(treqs).build\r\n\r\ndf.mapInPandas(func, \"id long\", False, rp).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe newly added tests can pass, and some manual tests are needed for dynamic allocation on or off.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-23T10:59:33Z","updated_at":"2024-02-20T00:37:35Z","closed_at":"2024-02-19T07:32:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6282279e4c4bb6e6f527bdbc1c623498f994ed78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44852/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44852/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44852/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3a3daacc71d2fbde66596fd435be1736c4ea4c18","head":{"label":"wbo4958:df-rp","ref":"df-rp","sha":"3a3daacc71d2fbde66596fd435be1736c4ea4c18","user":{"login":"wbo4958","id":1320706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjA3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1320706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958","html_url":"https://github.com/wbo4958","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":245613513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDU2MTM1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"wbo4958/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wbo4958","id":1320706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjA3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1320706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958","html_url":"https://github.com/wbo4958","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/g

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnsure old SparkUI in HistoryServer has been detached before loading new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe error described in SPARK-43403 happened quite often when user opened SparkUIs of in-progress Apps frequently.\r\n\r\nIt happened when `FsHistoryProvider#onUIDetached` run (in thread-a) right after a new SparkUI with the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes:\r\n- Add the automated way of writing `error_classes.py` file, `from pyspark.errors.exceptions import _write_self; _write_self()`\r\n- Fix the formatting of the JSON file to be consistent\r\n- Fix typos within the error messages\r\n- Fix parameter names to be consistent (it fixes some, not all)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Now, it is difficult to add a new error class because it enforces alphabetical order or error classes, etc. When you add multiple error classes, you should manually fix and move them around which is troublesome.\r\n- In addition, the current JSON format isn't very consistent.\r\n- For consistency. This PR includes the changes of *some* of parameter naming.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it fixes a couple of typos.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were fixed together.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up the obsolete code in PySpark coverage script\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe used to use `coverage_daemon.py` for Python workers to track the coverage of the Python worker side (e.g., the coverage within Python UDF), added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20204. However, seems it does not work anymore. In fact, it has been multiple years that it stopped working. The approach of replacing the Python worker itself was a bit hacky workaround. We should just get rid of them first, and find a proper way.\r\n\r\nThis should also deflake the scheduled jobs, and speed up the build.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n./run-tests-with-coverage --python-executables=python3 --testname=\"pyspark.sql.functions.builtin\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nFinished test(python3): pyspark.sql.tests.test_functions (87s)\r\nTests passed in 87 seconds\r\nCombining collected coverage data under\r\n...\r\nCreating XML report file at python/coverage.xml\r\nWrote XML report to coverage.xml\r\nReporting the coverage data at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to rename `spark.deploy.spreadOut` to `spark.deploy.spreadOutApps`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough Apache Spark documentation clearly says it's about `applications`, this still misleads users to forget `Driver` JVMs which will be spread out always independently from this configuration.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b80e8cb4552268b771fc099457b9186807081c4a/docs/spark-standalone.md?plain=1#L282-L285\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the behavior is the same. Only it will show warnings for old config name usages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that RocksDB loads do not run into SST file Version ID mismatch issue. RocksDB has added validation to ensure exact same SST file is used during database load from snapshot. Current streaming state suffers from certain edge cases where this condition is violated resulting in state load failure. \r\n\r\nThe changes introduced are: \r\n\r\n1. Ensure that the local SST file is exactly the same DFS file (as per mapping in metadata.zip). We keep track of the DFS file path for a local SST file, and re download the SST file in case DFS file has a different UUID in metadata zip.\r\n2. Reset lastSnapshotVersion in RocksDB when Rocks DB is loaded. Changelog checkpoint relies on this version for future snapshots. Currently, if a older version is reloaded we were not uploading snapshots as lastSnapshotVersion was pointing to a higher snapshot of a cleanup database.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe need to ensure that the correct SST files are used on executor during RocksDB load as per mapping in metadata.zip. With current implementation, its possible that the executor uses a SST file (with a different UUID) from a older version which is not the exact file mapped in the metadata.zip. This can cause version Id mismatch errors while loading RocksDB leading to streaming query failures.\r\n\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46796 for failure scenarios. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded exhaustive unit testcases covering the scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Updated the `ReplaceDeduplicateWithAggregate` implementation to reuse aliases generated for an attribute.\r\n- Added a unit test to ensure scenarios with duplicate non-grouping keys are correctly optimized.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n- `ReplaceDeduplicateWithAggregate` replaces `Deduplicate` with an `Aggregate` operator with grouping expressions for the deduplication keys and aggregate expressions for the non-grouping keys (to preserve the output schema and keep the non-grouping columns).\r\n- For non-grouping key `a#X`, it generates an aggregate expression of the form `first(a#X, false) AS a#Y`\r\n- In case the non-grouping keys have a repeated attribute (with the same name and exprId), the existing logic would generate two different aggregate expressions both having two different exprId.\r\n- This then leads to duplicate rewrite attributes error (in `transformUpWithNewOutput`) when transforming the remaining tree.\r\n\r\n- For example, for the query\r\n```\r\nProject [a#0, b#1]\r\n+- Deduplicate [b#1]\r\n   +- Project [a#0, a#0, b#1]\r\n      +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1]\r\n```\r\nthe existing logic would transform it to\r\n```\r\nProject [a#3, b#1]\r\n+- Aggregate [b#1], [first(a#0, false) AS a#3, first(a#0, false) AS a#5, b#1]\r\n   +- Project [a#0, a#0, b#1]\r\n      +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1]\r\n```\r\nwith the aggregate mapping having two entries `a#0 -> a#3, a#0 -> a#5`.\r\n\r\nThe correct transformation would be \r\n```\r\nProject [a#3, b#1]\r\n+- Aggregate [b#1], [first(a#0, false) AS a#3, first(a#0, false) AS a#3, b#1]\r\n   +- Project [a#0, a#0, b#1]\r\n      +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#0, b#1]\r\n```\r\nwith the aggregate mapping having only one entry `a#0 -> a#3`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a unit test in `ResolveOperatorSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRevert [SPARK-35878][CORE] Add fs.s3a.endpoint if unset and fs.s3a.endpoint.region is null\r\n\r\nRemoving the region/endpoint patching code of SPARK-35878 avoids authentication problems with versions of the S3A connector built with AWS v2 SDK -as is the case in Hadoop 3.4.0.\r\n\r\nThat is: if fs.s3a.endpoint is unset it will stay unset.\r\n\r\nThe v2 SDK does its binding to AWS Services differently, in what can be described as \"region first\" binding. Spark setting the endpoint blocks S3 Express support and is incompatible with HADOOP-18975 S3A: Add option fs.s3a.endpoint.fips to use AWS FIPS endpoints\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/6277\r\n\r\nThe change is compatible with all releases of the s3a connector other than hadoop 3.3.1 binaries deployed outside EC2 and without the endpoint explicitly set.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAWS v2 SDK has a different/complex binding mechanism; it doesn't need the endpoint to\r\nbe set if the region (fs.s3a.region) value is set. This means the spark code to\r\nfix an endpoint is not only un-needed, it causes problems when trying to use specific\r\nstorage options (S3 Express) or security options (FIPS)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nOnly visible on hadoop 3.3.1 s3a connector when deployed outside of EC2 -the situation the original patch was added to work around. All other 3.3.x releases are good.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRemoved some obsolete tests. Relying on github and jenkins to do the testing so marking this PR as WiP until they are happy.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR modifies `LogicalRDD` to filter out all subqueries from its `constraints`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixes a correctness bug. Spark can produce incorrect results when using a checkpointed `DataFrame` with a filter containing a scalar subquery. This subquery is included in the constraints of the resulting `LogicalRDD`, and may then be propagated as a filter when joining with the checkpointed `DataFrame`. This causes the subquery to be evaluated twice: once during checkpointing and once while evaluating the query. These two subquery evaluations may return different results, e.g. when the subquery contains a limit with an underspecified sort order.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a test to `DataFrameSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRefactor ChannelBuilder into ChannelBuilder and DefaultChannelBuilder. ChannelBuilder is a abstract class with certain base functionality other possible channel builders should inherit. DefaultChannelBuilder is the current implementation of ChannelBuilder.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe concept of ChannelBuilder was introduced specifically so that different implementations of Channel Builder would exist. However, the current version makes it hard to actually implement custom functionality, because the interface of channel builder and it's standard implementation are tied so closely.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests; new e2e test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNope :)

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to add a warning log when calling `hive.getTable` throw `HiveException` and `throwException` is `false`, to propagate the server-side exception message to client logs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44364, when `throwException` is false, and error exception occurs, e.g. permission issue, the client silently swallows the exception, and reports table not exist, which is quite misleading.\r\n\r\nThere is an example, the user Spark query gets an `AnalysisException` saying table not found: `******`.`****`, but this table exists in fact.\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Table or view not found: ******.****; line 128 pos 9;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen checking the HMS logs, it shows a `MetaException` with a clear error message returned.\r\n```\r\nMetaException(message:java.security.AccessControlException: Permission denied: user=****, access=READ, inode=\"/user/****/hive_db/******.db/****\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nReview\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nLike `Union`,  support coalesce partition for partial shuffle child with `CartesianProduct`.\r\n```\r\nCartesianProduct\r\n   HashAggregate\r\n      ShuffleQueryStage\r\n   FileScan\r\n```\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLike `Union`, `CartesianProduct` does not need all children have same number of output partitions. Coalesce partition for partial shuffle child shuffle can improve performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the support of Java `Set` as bean field in `JavaTypeInference`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nScala `Set` (`scala.collection.Set`) is supported in `ScalaReflection` so users can encode Scala `Set` in Dataset. But Java `Set` is not supported in bean encoder (i.e., `JavaTypeInference`). This feature inconsistency makes Java users cannot use `Set` like Scala users do.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Java `Set` is supported to be part of Java bean when encoding with bean encoder.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLink anchors are case sensitive (at least on Safari). Many of the links in the SQL error pages use the incorrect case, so the anchor doesn't jump to the correct heading. This PR fixes those anchors.\r\n\r\nThere is also a bad link in the menu, which this PR also fixes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLinks should point to their intended target.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, user-facing documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI built the SQL docs with:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nSKIP_SCALADOC=1 SKIP_PYTHONDOC=1 SKIP_RDOC=1 bundle exec jekyll build\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I clicked around a bunch of the SQL error pages to confirm the link anchors now work correctly.\r\n\r\nI also confirmed the menu link also works correctly now.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-22T01:54:44Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T02:22:31Z","closed_at":"2024-01-23T00:12:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"183773b1d5aa85b3e4d9de7d61769a32817cf139","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d021798a564814eb54cf05f689c50e4abb996b7","head":{"label":"nchammas:sql-error-links","ref":"sql-error-links","sha":"0d021798a564814eb54cf05f689c50e4abb996b7","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

This prepares the codebase to be able to extend certain V2 optimization rules (e.g. `V2ScanRelationPushDown`) to be applied to streaming in the future.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs described above, we would like to start reuse certain V2 batch optimization rules to apply to streaming relations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is a pure refactoring, existing tests should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-20T23:22:12Z","updated_at":"2024-01-22T09:59:02Z","closed_at":"2024-01-22T09:59:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2245adb013194cebad71a581be24e92e50b201a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe [Spark docs index](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/) page hasn't been updated in a while and this PR cleans up the language and shifts the examples from RDDs => DataFrames.\r\n\r\nIf this PR gets merged, I would like to take another stab and give even more detailed installation instructions.  Showing users how to run scripts from the command line is cool, but I think it would also be nice to explain how to include Spark in a Python project and run a Jupyter notebook with Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe'd like to encourage users to use DataFrames instead of RDDs.\r\n\r\nThis post ranks for \"spark install\" searches and we would also like to make it easier for users to install Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo user facing code changes, but this would be user facing docs changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen canonicalizing `output` in `InMemoryRelation`, use `output` itself as the schema for determining the ordinals, rather than `cachedPlan.output`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`InMemoryRelation.output` and `InMemoryRelation.cachedPlan.output` don't necessarily use the same exprIds. E.g.:\r\n```\r\n+- InMemoryRelation [c1#340, c2#341], StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)\r\n      +- LocalTableScan [c1#254, c2#255]\r\n\r\n```\r\nBecause of this, `InMemoryRelation` will sometimes fail to fully canonicalize, resulting in cases where two semantically equivalent `InMemoryRelation` instances appear to be semantically nonequivalent.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view data(c1, c2) as values\r\n(1, 2),\r\n(1, 3),\r\n(3, 7),\r\n(4, 5);\r\n\r\ncache table data;\r\n\r\nselect c1, (select count(*) from data d1 where d1.c1 = d2.c1), count(c2) from data d2 group by all;\r\n```\r\nIf plan change validation checking is on (i.e., `spark.sql.planChangeValidation=true`), the failure is:\r\n```\r\n[PLAN_VALIDATION_FAILED_RULE_EXECUTOR] The input plan of org.apache.spark.sql.internal.BaseSessionStateBuilder$$anon$2 is invalid: Aggregate: Aggregate [c1#78, scalar-subquery#77 [c1#78]], [c1#78, scalar-subquery#77 [c1#78] AS scalarsubquery(c1)#90L, count(c2#79) AS count(c2)#83L]\r\n...\r\nis not a valid aggregate expression: [SCALAR_SUBQUERY_IS_IN_GROUP_BY_OR_AGGREGATE_FUNCTION] The correlated scalar subquery '\"scalarsubquery(c1)\"' is neither present in GROUP BY, nor in an aggregate function.\r\n```\r\nIf plan change validation checking is off, the failure is more mysterious:\r\n```\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] Couldn't find count(1)#163L in [c1#78,_groupingexpression#149L,count(1)#82L] SQLSTATE: XX000\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: [INTERNAL_ERROR] Couldn't find count(1)#163L in [c1#78,_groupingexpression#149L,count(1)#82L] SQLSTATE: XX000\r\n```\r\nIf you remove the cache command, the query succeeds.\r\n\r\nThe above failures happen because the subquery in the aggregate expressions and the subquery in the grouping expressions seem semantically nonequivalent since the `InMemoryRelation` in one of the subquery plans failed to completely canonicalize.\r\n\r\nIn `CacheManager#useCachedData`, two lookups for the same cached plan may create `InMemoryRelation` instances that have different exprIds in `output`. That's because the plan fragments used as lookup keys  may have been deduplicated by `DeduplicateRelations`, and thus have different exprIds in their respective output schemas. When `CacheManager#useCachedData` creates an `InMemoryRelation` instance, it borrows the output schema of the plan fragment used as the lookup key.\r\n\r\nThe failure to fully canonicalize has other effects. For example, this query fails to reuse the exchange:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view data(c1, c2) as values\r\n(1, 2),\r\n(1, 3),\r\n(2, 4),\r\n(3, 7),\r\n(7, 22);\r\n\r\ncache table data;\r\n\r\nset spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1;\r\nset spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=false;\r\n\r\nselect *\r\nfrom data l\r\njoin data r\r\non l.c1 = r.c1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdate the \"Building Spark\" docs as follows:\r\n- Add mention of Scaleway to the Jenkins section so developers understand its relevance (since we retired the project's own Jenkins infra some time back).\r\n- Add syntax highlighting to some of the code blocks.\r\n- Adjust the headings of some sections that were set too deep.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis makes the guide a bit more up-to-date and easier to read.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it changes the public documentation on building Spark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually built the docs and reviewed the results.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44368 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44513, implementing an additional type promotion from integers to decimals in the parquet vectorized reader, bringing it at parity with the non-vectorized reader in that regard.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis allows reading parquet files that have different schemas and mix decimals and integers - e.g reading files containing either `Decimal(15, 2)` and `INT32` as `Decimal(15, 2)` - as long as the requested decimal type is large enough to accommodate the integer values without precision loss.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the following now succeeds when using the vectorized Parquet reader:\r\n```\r\n  Seq(20).toDF($\"a\".cast(IntegerType)).write.parquet(path)\r\n  spark.read.schema(\"a decimal(12, 0)\").parquet(path).collect()\r\n```\r\nIt failed before with the vectorized reader and succeeded with the non-vectorized reader.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Tests added to `ParquetWideningTypeSuite`\r\n- Updated relevant `ParquetQuerySuite` test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-01-19T16:53:46Z","updated_at":"2024-01-25T00:16:38Z","closed_at":"2024-01-23T20:37:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6968735405ad13e803bc7f4339d677c6343bf12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44803/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44803/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44803/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8935b284e5519038f78fd95c8d12e66224f29d63","head":{"label":"johanl-db:SPARK-40876-widening-promotion-int-to-decimal","ref":"SPARK-40876-widening-promotion-int-to-decimal","sha":"8935b284e5519038f78fd95c8d12e66224f29d63","user":{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":556757623,"node_id":"R_kgDOIS9ydw","name":"spark","full_name":"johanl-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db/spark","description":"Apache

Also, in fact, before this PR, in the output jars built using SBT, connect-common and common-server were the same thing, because they both hit the `jar.getName.contains(\"spark-connect\")` condition.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

This consistency is important to avoid nondeterministic behaviors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid non-deterministic behaviors. After https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43243 , we can still have inconsistency if the LEGACY mode is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes for the legacy parser. Now it's more likely to infer string type instead of inferring timestamp type \"by luck\"\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr change to use include-list to generate `assemblyExcludedJars` option for the connect server module to ensure `sbt assembly` and `maven-shaded-plugin` package the same jars. The reason for no longer using the exclude list is because it requires more configuration(There are over 40 additional jars that need to be excluded)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake `sbt assembly` and `maven-shaded-plugin` package the same jars\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to upgrade Arrow from 14.0.2 to 15.0.0, this version fixes the compatibility issue with Netty 4.1.104.Final(GH-39265).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since the `arrow-vector` module uses `eclipse-collections` to replace `netty-common` as a compile-level dependency, Apache Spark has added a dependency on `eclipse-collections` after upgrading to use Arrow 15.0.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe new version brings the following major changes:\r\n\r\nBug Fixes\r\nGH-34610 - [Java] Fix valueCount and field name when loading/transferring NullVector\r\nGH-38242 - [Java] Fix incorrect internal struct accounting for DenseUnionVector#getBufferSizeFor\r\nGH-38254 - [Java] Add reusable buffer getters to char/binary vectors\r\nGH-38366 - [Java] Fix Murmur hash on buffers less than 4 bytes\r\nGH-38387 - [Java] Fix JDK8 compilation issue with TestAllTypes\r\nGH-38614 - [Java] Add VarBinary and VarCharWriter helper methods to more writers\r\nGH-38725 - [Java] decompression in Lz4CompressionCodec.java does not set writer index\r\n\r\nNew Features and Improvements\r\nGH-38511 - [Java] Add getTransferPair(Field, BufferAllocator, CallBack) for StructVector and MapVector\r\nGH-14936 - [Java] Remove netty dependency from arrow-vector\r\nGH-38990 - [Java] Upgrade to flatc version 23.5.26\r\nGH-39265 - [Java] Make it run well with the netty newest version 4.1.104\r\n\r\nThe full release notes as follows:\r\n\r\n- https://arrow.apache.org/release/15.0.0.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-19T08:10:11Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T05:27:13Z","closed_at":"2024-01-23T05:25:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59d16fb1225001e15f0e55b35de2a0b4bf471b2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/951b7e57034e65be21eaf8b6717c3881ffa38fe5","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-46718","ref":"SPARK-46718","sha":"951b7e57034e65be21eaf8b6717c3881ffa38fe5","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove legacy `docker-for-desktop` logic in favor of `docker-desktop`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Docker Desktop switched the underlying node name and context to `docker-desktop` in 2020. \r\n  - https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/5089#issuecomment-582752325\r\n- Since Apache Spark 3.2.2, we have been hiding it from the documentation via SPARK-38272 and now we can delete it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs and manually test with Docker Desktop.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Psparkr -Pkubernetes -Pkubernetes-integration-tests -Dtest.exclude.tags=minikube,local

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe are abusing Jekyll's plugin system to set flags for what API docs to build. This change maintains this overall status quo but makes the following improvements:\r\n\r\n- Rename the plugin file to be in line with its actual purpose.\r\n- Organize the code into functions so it's easier to follow and understand.\r\n- Print section headers that are easier to find in the output when building the docs.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the documentation build otherwise remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis should make maintaining this part of the doc building workflow easier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIn several ways:\r\n- I built the docs with various skip flags set and confirmed the build succeeds. I also manually browsed through some of the Scala, Java, Python, and SQL API docs.\r\n    - The only docs I didn't test building were the R docs, because I do not have R installed locally.\r\n    - Here is the build output on my machine for `SKIP_RDOC=1`: [build-docs.log.zip][build-log]\r\n    - There are some errors output when building the Java unidoc, but these are [present already in master][already].\r\n- I built the docs against `master` and diffed the resulting `_site/` directory against the one output by this branch.\r\n    - The `_site/` directories are identical except for minor differences in some general SQL function example files.\r\n    - Here is the diff: [site.diff.zip][site-diff]\r\n- I also confirmed that `./dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13` runs successfully (though I didn't try to run the modified scripts after that).\r\n\r\n[build-log]: https://github.com/apache/spark/files/13983386/build-docs.log.zip\r\n[already]: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/7594517103/job/20686140435#step:30:3876\r\n[site-diff]: https://github.com/apache/spark/files/14027280/site.diff.zip\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to revert inferring of the `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` type in the CSV/JSON datasources before the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43243.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43243, the TIMESTAMP_NTZ type inference in CSV/JSON datasource got 2 new guards which means TIMESTAMP_NTZ should be inferred either if:\r\n1. the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy` is set to `LEGACY` or\r\n2. `spark.sql.timestampType` is set to `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`.\r\n\r\notherwise CSV/JSON should try to infer `TIMESTAMP_LTZ`.\r\n\r\nBoth guards are unnecessary because:\r\n1. when `spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy` is `LEGACY` that only means Spark should use a legacy Java 7- parser: `FastDateFormat` or `SimpleDateFormat`. Both parsers are applicable for parsing `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`.\r\n2. when `spark.sql.timestampType` is set to `TIMESTAMP_LTZ`, it doesn't mean that we should skip inferring of `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` types in CSV/JSON, and try to parse the timestamp string value w/o time zone like `2024-01-19T09:10:11.123` using a LTZ format **with timezone** like `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX`. _The last one cannot match any NTZ values for sure._\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it could.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *JsonInferSchemaSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *CSVLegacyTimeParserSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBasic support of SparkSession-based memory profiler in both Spark Connect and non-Spark-Connect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe need to make the memory profiler SparkSession-based to support memory profiling in Spark Connect. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the SparkSession-based memory profiler is available.\r\n\r\nAn example is as shown below\r\n```py\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import *\r\nfrom pyspark.taskcontext import TaskContext\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.pyspark.udf.profiler\", \"memory\")\r\n\r\n@udf(\"string\")\r\ndef f(x):\r\n  if TaskContext.get().partitionId() % 2 == 0:\r\n    return str(x)\r\n  else:\r\n    return None\r\n\r\nspark.range(10).select(f(col(\"id\"))).show()\r\n\r\nspark.showMemoryProfiles()\r\n```\r\nshows profile result:\r\n```\r\n============================================================\r\nProfile of UDF<id=2>\r\n============================================================\r\nFilename:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs a part of SPARK-45869 (Revisit and Improve Spark Standalone Cluster), this PR aims to remove `*slave*` scripts from `sbin` directory for Apache Spark 4.0.0 codebase and binary distributions.\r\n```\r\nspark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3:$ ls -al sbin/*slave*\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 dongjoon  staff  981 Sep  8 19:08

are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`*slave*.sh` scripts are deprecated at Apache Spark 3.1.0 (March, 2021) via SPARK-32004 (July 2020).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but \r\n- these are only wrapper scripts for legacy environments and were removed from all documents.\r\n- the new alternative corresponding scripts have been documented instead and used for last 3 years.\r\n- we can simplify the `sbin` directory of binary distributions for a better UX.\r\n- Apache Spark 4.0.0 is a good and the last chance to clean up these.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CI and manual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace all `UnsupportedOperationException` by `SparkUnsupportedOperationException` in `sql/core` code base, and introduce new legacy error classes with the `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` prefix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo unify Spark SQL exception, and port Java exceptions on Spark exceptions with error classes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it can if user's code assumes some particular format of `UnsupportedOperationException` messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *FileBasedDataSourceSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ColumnarRulesSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-01-17T14:22:53Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T17:42:23Z","closed_at":"2024-01-23T17:42:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d96e82d690cd9cea1914816c3eec9717816b688","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to display clear `exit command` for all spark terminal, includes: \r\n`spark-shell`, `spark-sql`, `spark-connect-repl`, `pyspark` and `sparkR`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBecause some `exit commands` are `different` across different terminals, in order to promote a better user experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, when the user starts the terminal, they can clearly see `the exit command`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-17T09:18:54Z","updated_at":"2024-04-29T00:19:24Z","closed_at":"2024-04-29T00:19:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9c63664b7eb54377de013be8eb49eb8b776aa327","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406628559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI4NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SHELL","name":"SPARK

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to rename \"Spark SQL\" page to \"DataFrame API\".\r\n\r\nThis includes updating the title and any relevant references within the documentation to better highlight the centrality of the DataFrame API in PySpark.\r\n\r\nThis also includes adding SQL Reference related descriptions and links to the `pyspark.sql.SparkSession.sql` API to make it easier for users to use SQL supported by Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe change is needed to more accurately represent the content of the page, which primarily focuses on the DataFrame API – a key aspect of PySpark. Renaming the page to \"DataFrame API\" emphasizes its importance and utility in the PySpark ecosystem, making the documentation more intuitive and aligned with the common usage and understanding of PySpark's core functionalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but user-facing documentation will be updated:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main\r\n<img width=\"1245\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-17 at 3 24 46 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/0d101187-7987-4c5e-bc87-5a20a557415e\">\r\n\r\n## API Reference\r\n<img width=\"825\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-17 at 4 04 52 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/2214e1d2-63f5-4322-992e-293a1d4aaee6\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## SparkSession.sql\r\n<img width=\"769\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-17 at 3 54 23 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/ce1f5589-12e4-472c-81f9-3edbb5fcddfd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe should only convert a Hive Parquet table to a Parquet FileScan if it is a normal Hive Parquet Table by checking the SerDe and InputFormat.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is because the Hive Table may not be a normal created Parquet table thus have special handling by the user code. In this case converting directly to Parquet FileScan might skipping the special handling thus cause issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting Test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-01-17T03:46:04Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T17:10:27Z","closed_at":"2024-01-24T17:10:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea6649a6ba4896f377e1d9b67ed953943ce7b04e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44764/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44764/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44764/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6a1d3f33b3ae78ca52061b668ea75307d987e61e","head":{"label":"amaliujia:isConvertible","ref":"isConvertible","sha":"6a1d3f33b3ae78ca52061b668ea75307d987e61e","user":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":434752466,"node_id":"R_kgDOGenL0g","name":"spark","full_name":"amaliujia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"amaliujia","id":1938382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzgzODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1938382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia","html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaliujia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/amaliujia/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSimilar with SPARK-44794, propagate JobArtifactState to broadcast/subquery thread.\r\n\r\nThis is an example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval add1 = udf((i: Long) => i + 1)\r\nval tableA = spark.range(2).alias(\"a\")\r\nval tableB = broadcast(spark.range(2).select(add1(col(\"id\")).alias(\"id\"))).alias(\"b\")\r\ntableA.join(tableB).\r\n

example will throw exception `ClassNotFoundException`. Subquery and Broadcast execution use a separate ThreadPool which don't have the `JobArtifactState`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix bug.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen using pandas UDFs with iterators, if users enable the profiling spark conf, a warning indicating non-support should be raised, and profiling should be disabled.\r\n\r\nHowever, currently, after raising the not-supported warning, the memory profiler is still being enabled.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposed to fix that.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA bug fix to eliminate misleading behavior. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe noticeable changes will affect only those using the PySpark shell. This is because, in the PySpark shell, the memory profiler will raise an error, which in turn blocks the execution of the UDF.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nSetup:\r\n```py\r\n$ ./bin/pyspark --conf spark.python.profile=true\r\n\r\n>>> from typing import Iterator\r\n>>> from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to skip `Pandas`-related  or `PyArrow`-related tests in `pyspark.sql.tests.test_group` if they are not installed.\r\n\r\nThis regression was introduced by\r\n- #44322\r\n- #42767\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince `Pandas` and `PyArrow` are optional, we need to skip the tests instead of failures.\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new error class for unsupported method calls, and remove similar legacy error classes. New `apply()` method of `SparkUnsupportedOperationException` extracts method and class name from stack traces automatically, and places them to error class parameters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance by avoid boilerplate code (extract class and method names automatically), and to clean up `error-classes.json`. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it can if user's code depends on the error class or message format of `SparkUnsupportedOperationException`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ShuffleSpecSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEnable Spark configs to be assigned to documentation groups via a dedicated YAML file. These groups will be used by a new Python script to automatically build config tables for display in our documentation.\r\n\r\nInstead of having to maintain [large blocks of HTML tables][1] throughout our documentation, config tables can simply be included as follows:\r\n\r\n```liquid\r\n{% include_api_gen _generated/config_tables/sql-tuning-caching-data.html %}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`sql-tuning-caching-data` would be the name of the config group defined in the YAML file from which the above HTML table would be automatically generated for inclusion in our documentation.\r\n\r\nThis approach covers both SQL and non-SQL config docs and, if accepted, will replace `sql/gen-sql-config-docs.py`.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is an alternative to #44755 (and #44300) that does not require modifying `ConfigEntry` or `ConfigBuilder` to add a new field. Instead, the groups are defined completely outside of Spark's core.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7db85642600b1e3b39ca11e41d4e3e0bf1c8962b/docs/sql-performance-tuning.md?plain=1#L37-L56\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsing this approach we can accomplish several goals at once:\r\n\r\n- Eliminate thousands of lines of manually maintained HTML tables of Spark configs.\r\n- Ensure that internal configs are not accidentally documented publicly. (e.g. `spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes`)\r\n- Ensure that configs are documented publicly exactly as they are in the code. (e.g. unlike `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`)\r\n- Improve the presentation of the HTML tables by refining how long config names wrap, as proposed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44955.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, not for users.\r\n\r\nFor contributors, the documentation build will change so that config tables are generated only when Spark is built. For fast documentation builds -- like what we currently have via `SKIP_API=1` -- Spark won't be built and placeholders will be inserted in the place of every config table. This will be addressed in a future PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually ran the new script to generate config tables and confirmed the following:\r\n\r\n- The desired config tables are generated.\r\n- If a config is mentioned in the YAML file but is not found, the script errors.\r\n- If a config group is defined in the YAML file that uses a reserved name, the script errors.\r\n- If a config group name is invalid, the script errors.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEnable Spark configs to be assigned to documentation groups via a new `documentationGroups` field on `ConfigEntry`. These groups will be used to automatically build config tables for display in our documentation.\r\n\r\nInstead of having to maintain [large blocks of HTML tables][1] throughout our documentation, config tables can simply be included as follows:\r\n\r\n```liquid\r\n{% include_api_gen _generated/config_tables/sql-tuning-caching-data.html %}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`sql-tuning-caching-data` would be the name of a configuration group defined directly on multiple instances of `ConfigEntry` to group them together, and from which the above HTML table would be automatically generated for inclusion in our documentation.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a stripped down version of #44300 to facilitate review of the core idea.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7db85642600b1e3b39ca11e41d4e3e0bf1c8962b/docs/sql-performance-tuning.md?plain=1#L37-L56\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsing this approach we can accomplish several goals at once:\r\n\r\n- Eliminate thousands of lines of manually maintained HTML tables of Spark configs.\r\n- Ensure that internal configs are not accidentally documented publicly. (e.g. `spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes`)\r\n- Ensure that configs are documented publicly exactly as they are in the code. (e.g. unlike `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`)\r\n- Improve the presentation of the HTML tables by refining how long config names wrap, as proposed in #44955.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, not for users.\r\n\r\nFor contributors, the documentation build will change so that config tables are generated only when Spark is built. For fast documentation builds -- like what we currently have via `SKIP_API=1` -- Spark won't be built and placeholders will be inserted in the place of every config table. This will be addressed in a future PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo testing beyond what was already done in #44300, pending review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSimilar with SPARK-44794, propagate JobArtifactState to broadcast/subquery thread.\r\n\r\nThis is an example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval add1 = udf((i: Long) => i + 1)\r\nval tableA = spark.range(2).alias(\"a\")\r\nval tableB = broadcast(spark.range(2).select(add1(col(\"id\")).alias(\"id\"))).alias(\"b\")\r\ntableA.join(tableB).\r\n  where(col(\"a.id\")===col(\"b.id\")).\r\n  select(col(\"a.id\").alias(\"a_id\"), col(\"b.id\").alias(\"b_id\")).\r\n  collect().\r\n  mkString(\"[\", \", \", \"]\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this pr, this example will throw exception `ClassNotFoundException`. Subquery and Broadcast execution use a separate ThreadPool which don't have the `JobArtifactState`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix bug. Make Subquery/Broadcast thread work with Connect's artifact management.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a new test to `ReplE2ESuite`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI
