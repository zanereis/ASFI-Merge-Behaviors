Description\r\nSwitches `DictionaryIdLookup` to serialize the value dictionaries and then use mmap to load into their respective `Indexed` implementations instead of using the the `{x}2IntMap` heap collections we were previously using, resulting in dramatically more predictable heap usage at very minor performance cost.\r\n\r\nBefore (the peaks are merge/publish, 10m rows, 5m max segment size):\r\n![Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 5 54 00 PM](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/55923819-9165-4391-bca2-223dac27d073)\r\n\r\nAfter (the dips are merge/publish with the peaks at the end being bitmap index creation):\r\n![Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 5 54 36 PM](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/4d941185-ed97-41b0-b4ce-f58527d017d1)\r\n\r\nIt does add a bit extra time to the task I used in my experiment:\r\n<img width=\"585\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-23 at 5 52 53 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/54513bcf-f357-4fd4-a513-41ab50eb3c98\">\r\n\r\nbut it seems worth the cost, and probably in practice potentially faster than the heap based approach when the task has a lot less room to spare and faces more expensive gc cycles. I will be looking for other areas to improve in exchange for this change.\r\n\r\nI also refactored a few things to clean some stuff up (mainly consolidating code around reading string dictionaries when the dictionary might be front-coded or classic generic indexed based that was duplicated in a bunch of places).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] been tested in a

Description\r\nAdding the ability for mm-less ingestion to zero-downtime migrate to and from WorkerTaskRunners (using MM's)\r\n\r\nThe KubernetesAndWorkerTaskRunner is aware of tasks running on workers and tasks running on Kubernetes, so it is able to cleanly rolling upgrade to/from Kubernetes or the Worker task runner. It can choose to schedule tasks onto either workers or onto Kubernetes depending on a config. Currently this is all or nothing (there's no way to split task scheduling), but this is something that could be added in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nAdding support for zero-downtime migration to WorkerTaskRunners\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesAndWorkerTaskRunnerConfig`\r\n * `KubernetesAndWorkerTaskRunner`\r\n * `KubernetesAndWorkerTaskRunnerFactory`\r\n\r\nAlso had to make a few supporting changes in TaskMaster/TaskRunner/CliPeon\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nIn the `smartSegmentLoading` mode, the Coordinator is able to handle unlimited load queues.\r\n\r\nSo, it is safe to increase the computed values of `replicationThrottleLimit` to allow segments to reach max replication levels faster.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to even completely remove the `replicationThrottleLimit` but we would want to retain it to prevent unnecessary loads on servers in case a server disappears from the cluster intermittently.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Increase value of `replicationThrottleLimit` computed by `smartSegmentLoading` from 2% to 5% of total number of used segments.\r\n- Assign replicas to a tier even when some replicas are already being loaded in that tier\r\n- Limit the total number of replicas in load queue at start of run + replica assignments in the run to the `replicationThrottleLimit`.\r\n```java\r\nfor every tier,\r\n    num replicas in load queue at start of run + num replicas assigned in run <= replicationThrottleLimit\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Changes\r\n- Determine the default value of `balancerComputeThreads` based on number of coordinator cpus rather than number of segments. Even if the number of segments is low and we create more balancer threads, it doesn't hurt the system as threads would mostly be idle.\r\n- Remove unused field from `SegmentLoadQueueManager`\r\n\r\n### Expected values\r\n- Clusters with ~1M segments typically work with Coordinators having 16 cores or more. This would give us 8 balancer threads, which is the same as the current maximum.\r\n- On small clusters, even a single thread is enough to do the required balancing work.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nThe coordinator dynamic config now uses `num_cpus / 2` as the default value for `balancerComputeThreads` instead of the old value of `1`.\r\nThis is also the value used when `smartSegmentLoading` is enabled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the `FieldWriters` to write numerical arrays into Frames. This will allow the arrays to be written into row-based frames, which are currently being used by the MSQ engine. \r\n\r\nThe end goal is to extend this to `FrameColumnWriters` as well in follow-up patches so that the broker that can use Frame (column-based) to materialize the subquery results can also write and read numerical array columns. \r\n\r\nThe PR refactors the existing `long`, `double`, and `float` - `FieldWriters` and `FieldReaders` - to subclass from `NumericalFieldWriter` and `NumericalFieldReader`. \r\nThe new `NumericalArrayFieldWriter` and `NumericalArrayFieldReader` reuse these classes to write the numerical array.\r\n\r\n### Format\r\n\r\nThe format of the array value is written into the field as:\r\n\r\n1. 1st byte is reserved for whether the array is null or not.\r\n2. If the array is not null, we write the individual values into the memory consecutively using the preexisting field writers. There's one caveat, the null value is denoted with a 0x01 flag instead of 0x00 (which is used in normal numeric field writers), and the non-null value is denoted with a 0x02 flag instead of 0x01 (which is used in normal numeric field writers). This is done because it allows the field comparison per byte. \r\n3. We terminate the array with 0x00. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. The getObject() returns `null`\r\n\r\n| Bytes | Value | Interpretation |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| 1 | 0x00 | Denotes that the array null |\r\n\r\n_No end of array is needed in case of null array_\r\n\r\n2. The getObject returns `[]`\r\n\r\n\r\n| Bytes | Value | Interpretation |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| 1 | 0x01 | Denotes that the array is not null |\r\n| 1 | 0x00 | End of the array |\r\n\r\n4. The getObject returns `[5L, null, 6L]`\r\n\r\n| Bytes | Value | Interpretation |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| 1 | 0x01 | Denotes that the array is not null |\r\n| 2 | 0x02 | Denotes that the next element is not null |\r\n| 3-10 | transform(5) | Representation of 5 |\r\n| 11 | 0x01 | Denotes that the next element is null |\r\n| 12-19 | transform(0) | Representation of 0 (default value, the reader will ignore it if SqlCompatible mode is on | \r\n| 20 | 0x02 | Denotes that the next element is not null | \r\n| 21-28 | transform(6) | Representation of 6 | \r\n| 29 | 0x00 | End of array | \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTest cases added\r\n1. Individual test cases for the field writers and readers by the name of `<Type>ArrayFieldWriterTest` have been added.\r\n2. Added the Datasets to work with the unit tests that test out the frame creation and sorting E2E.\r\n3. (Not committed) Verified that the tests work with the `CalciteArraysQueryTests` as well. I have not committed to those changes yet since the UNNEST on MSQ https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14886 also creates the same file, and I wanted to avoid conflict since there's a high likelihood that PR might go in first. In case the reviews on this PR are completed, I'll update the PR before the merge with the changes.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility with older versions\r\nThe changes don't modify the original behavior of the frames, but add support for the newer types. Therefore the queries that were working before would continue to work as usual in case of a rolling upgrade with the newer version.\r\nThe queries that weren't working before might or might not fail in case of a rolling upgrade (when there are multiple versions of Druid in the same cluster) depending on the nodes that the workers are running on, whereas they would have definitely failed in the older cluster. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\nRow-based frames, and by extension, MSQ now supports numeric array types. This means that all queries consuming or producing arrays would also work with MSQ. Numeric arrays can also be ingested via MSQ. Post this patch, queries like, `SELECT [1, 2]` would work with MSQ since they consume a numeric array, instead of failing with an unsupported column type exception. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThe mm-less task runner differs in behavior from the other runners that run on the overlord because it tries to handle the cleanup lifecycle on its own by immediately deleting k8s jobs and clearing it's tasks map as soon as it has finished running a task.\r\n\r\nThe HttpRemoteTaskRunner and RemoteTaskRunner don't do this. Instead, they rely on the TaskQueue's handlers for the futures that all the task runners return to call shutdown on the task once it has completed.\r\n\r\nUpdating the mm-less task runner to use logic more similar to the other task runners has a couple benefits.\r\n- The task location (including the k8sPodName) is successfully persisted to taskStorage in TaskQueue.notifyStatus. Currently the mm-less task runner reports no location  in this function call because its run lifecycle will have already cleaned up the K8s Job and its tasks map.\r\n-  Currently, when a task completes, the taskQueue handler will try to call shutdown on the k8s task runner after the runner has already shut down the task. this creates a bunch of \"Ignoring request to cancel unknown task\" logs and in general seems likely to cause unexpected behavior in the future. Changing the logic will remove this duplication.\r\n\r\n**Changes**\r\n- In KubernetesPeonLifecycle, stop calling shutdown (to delete the K8s job) after a job has finished.\r\n- In KubernetesTaskRunner.doTask, stop removing the taskId from tasks in the logic of the run future.\r\n- In KubernetesTaskRunner.shutdown, remove taskId from tasks in addition to calling shutdown on the job. When taskQueue calls this shutdown function, everything in the task will be cleaned up as expected.\r\n- Remove the shutdownRequested flag from KubernetesWorkItem since we can now treat the presence (or lack of presence) of the taskId in the tasks map as a indicator of whether the task was shutdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nUpdate mm-less task runner lifecycle logic to better match the logic in the HTTP and Zookeeper worker task runners.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesPeonLifecycle`\r\n * `KubernetesTaskRunner`\r\n * `KubernetesWorkItem`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Motivation\r\n- Simplify coordinator config handling\r\n- After #14695 , something similar needs to be done for `DruidCoordinatorConfig`. This change would help build towards that.\r\n \r\n### Changes\r\n- Move following configs from `CliCoordinator` to `DruidCoordinatorConfig`:\r\n  - `druid.coordinator.kill.on`\r\n  - `druid.coordinator.kill.pendingSegments.on`\r\n  - `druid.coordinator.kill.supervisors.on`\r\n  - `druid.coordinator.kill.rules.on`\r\n  - `druid.coordinator.kill.audit.on`\r\n  - `druid.coordinator.kill.datasource.on`\r\n  - `druid.coordinator.kill.compaction.on`\r\n- In the Coordinator style used by historical management duties, always instantiate all the metadata cleanup duties but execute only if enabled. In the existing code, they are instantiated only when enabled by using optional binding with Guice.\r\n- Add a wrapper `MetadataManager` which contains handles to all the different metadata managers for rules, supervisors, segments, etc.\r\n- Add a `CoordinatorConfigManager` to simplify read and update of coordinator configs\r\n- Remove persistence related methods from `CoordinatorCompactionConfig` and `CoordinatorDynamicConfig` as these are config classes and persistence logic should not live here.\r\n- Remove annotations `@CoordinatorIndexingServiceDuty`, `@CoordinatorMetadataStoreManagementDuty`\r\n\r\n### Release Note\r\n- Druid extensions cannot bind custom coordinator duties to the duty groups `IndexingServiceDuties` and `MetadataStoreManagementDuties` anymore. These are meant to be core coordinator built-in flows and should not be affected by custom duties.\r\n- Users can still define a `CustomCoordinatorDuty` with a custom duty group and period.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis adds the option to copy query results directly to the clipboard.\r\n\r\nOther database UIs (such as BigQuery) provide a similar option and I use it all the time to copy results into github comments, slack threads etc.\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\n![demo2](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/16950874/5cad6b45-1f5f-4888-bf14-518b33aab420)\r\n(sorry for weird compression, I don't know how to make good screen-recording gifs)\r\n\r\n#### Open Questions:\r\n\r\n - Is it Ok to have `copyJSONResultsToClipboard` in `download.ts`, or should it live in its own file under `src/utils/`\r\n - Is the phrasing on the dropdown menu clear enough? \r\n - Should we impose a hidden limitation to prevent crashing the browser with a large output (max 1000 lines, etc)?\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\nAdded option to copy query results in the UI directly to the clipboard\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist below are strictly necessary, but it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR. -->\r\n\r\n#### This PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

bug where capacity for mm-less ingestion was not being properly reported\r\n### Description\r\nThis change: https://github.com/georgew5656/druid/commit/3954685aae1f9a78c81bf788e8f69d10324c28d1 to report additional metrics for mm-less ingestion changed the key of the capacity hint returned in getTotalTaskSlotCount and didn't change it in OverlordResource, causing capacity to be returned as 0.\r\n\r\n**Initial plan was:**\r\nI decided to just update the hardcoded value in OverlordResource because we can't ref classes from the optional extension in core and I couldn't really find a good constants file to put the constant in for OverlordResource. Open to changing this if someone has a strong opinion here.\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion I decided to move the logic for calculating capacity to the existing totalWorkerCapacity API instead of the /workers api. This cleans up the logic in the workers api (no need to pretend the k8s task runner has a worker), and lets us delete the isK8sTaskRunner method on the taskRunner.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n* Fix capacity response in mm-less ingestion.\r\n* Adds a new usedClusterCapacity to the GET /totalWorkerCapacity response. This API should be used to get the total ingestion capacity on the overlord.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `OverlordResource`\r\n * `TaskRunner,RemoteTaskRunner,HttpRemoteTaskRunner,KubernetesTaskRunner`\r\n\r\nK8s Task Runner with capacity of 100\r\n<img width=\"1701\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-24 at 9 52 15 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/17736581/200f54ac-655b-41a1-876e-1dc3038e1940\">\r\n\r\nHttp Remote Task runner with a worker with capacity of 5\r\n<img width=\"1724\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-24 at 9 53 29 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/17736581/41f4e2d2-0b38-4f8c-97dc-f6e6c83d6d8a\">\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

change is meant to fix a issue where passing too large of a task payload to the mm-less task runner will cause the peon to fail to startup because the payload is passed (compressed) as a environment variable (TASK_JSON). In linux systems the limit for a environment variable is commonly 128KB, for windows systems less than this. Setting a env variable longer than this results in a bunch of \"Argument list too long\" errors.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n**(1) Problem**\r\nThe goal of this patch is to prevent larger tasks from failing with mm-less ingestion due to the TASK_JSON being too large as described above.\r\n\r\n**(2) Solution**\r\nPart 1. Optionally stop setting TASK_JSON\r\n\r\nTo address the immediate problem (setting environment variables that are too large), I added a additional config for the KubernetesTaskRunner (druid.indexer.runner.taskPayloadAsEnvVariable) that defaults to true but can be optionally set to false. Setting this config to false will cause the K8s adapters to not set the task payload as the TASK_JSON env variable. This prevents the Jobs from failing to come up.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2. We still need to pass the task.json payload to the peons somehow. I explored three options for this, and ended up going with the below solution.\r\n\r\nPush the task payload into task logs deep storage and have the peon read the payload.\r\nI ended up going with this option because it was the most simple to implement and the most future-proof (no worry about task payloads getting larger than 1MB). The task logs killer will automatically delete the task.json in deep storage alongside he task logs whenever it is run.\r\n\r\nChanges Made\r\n- Introduced a new interface (TaskPayloadManager) that exposes two methods (push task payload, pull task payload) and is implemented by TaskLogs. (I only implemented it for S3TaskLogs, but it should be easy to implement for other deep storage systems).\r\n- Introduce a new config in TaskConfig (druid.indexer.task.enableTaskPayloadManagerPerTask). When set on the overlord, mm-less ingestion will push the task.json payload to deep storage before launching a k8s job. When set on the peon, the CliPeon task injector will read the task.json from deep storage instead of assuming it is available on the file system. This is currently only useable by mm-less ingestion but it technically could be used in any task running scenario.\r\n- The K8s adapters in mm-less ingestion will check deep storage if the config is set when converting K8s jobs to tasks in toTask\r\n\r\n**(3) Alternative solutions to passing the task.json payload**\r\n1. Using k8s configmaps to store the task payload and then mounting them onto the created peon pods. \r\nI decided not to go with this option because configmaps still have a 1MB size limit and I was concerned with the KubernetesTaskRunner having to manage a bunch of configmaps in addition to jobs. Having this many configmaps also pollutes K8s metadata, making it hard to see anything else going on when you're looking at configmaps.\r\n\r\n2. Updating CliPeon to use the getTaskPayload endpoint on the overlord to pull the task.json payload on startup. This didn't work because we currently have a guice injector in the peon that requires the task.json be available at injection time. In order to pull the task.json from the overlord, we need to use the ServiceLocator class which is only available once the peon lifecycle has already started (after injection). Changing this would have required many changes to the code so I didn't want to do it. Additionally, I would have had to deprecate the toTask interface on the overlords since there would be no way for the overlord to turn a K8s Job into a task definition.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Support compressed task payloads larger than 128KB in mm-less ingestion.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `CliPeon`\r\n * `KubernetesPeonLifecycle `\r\n * `PodTemplateTaskAdapter`\r\n * `K8sTaskAdapter`\r\n * `S3TaskLogs` `TaskLogs`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI can add some more documentation to this PR later but I wanted to get some feedback on this approach before doing so.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThere is no usage of the `SegmentTransactionInsertAction` which passes a non-null non-empty value of `segmentsToBeDropped`.\r\nThis is not really needed either as overshadowed segments are marked as unused by the Coordinator and need not be done in the same transaction as committing segments.\r\n\r\nThis will also help simplify the changes being made in #14407 \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Remove `segmentsToBeDropped` from the task action and all methods that have just been passing null\r\n- Remove related tests which are not needed anymore\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nDuring testing of the K8s task runner, peon pods faced challenges in achieving a graceful termination upon receiving a SIGTERM signal. Typically, they would encounter an `InterruptedException` and subsequently fail to push their `status.json`. As a result, the Druid console would display a vague \"task status not found\" message. Such graceful terminations may arise when a pod is manually deleted by K8s or is terminated due to out-of-memory conditions.\r\n\r\nThe primary issues behind this behavior are:\r\n\r\n1. When attempting to halt a task, the thread is interrupted. This interruption inadvertently prevents the completion of the task `cleanUp` operation.\r\n2. The task relies on services like `DiscoveryServiceLocator` and `OverlordClient` to execute its cleanUp work. However, since they all exist within the same lifecycle scope (NORMAL scope), there's a risk that the dependent services might be stopped before the task's `cleanUp` process concludes. To rectify this, we've transitioned the `SingleTaskBackgroundRunner` to the SERVER scope, ensuring the task stops prior to its dependent services, allowing for a successful cleanUp.\r\n\r\nNote: although the issue is from running K8sTaskRunner, but it's a general fix to peon jvms when receiving a sigint (instruction to gracefully stop) that we didn't notice before since it rarely happened within MiddleManager's\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Changes\r\n- Move logic of `NewestSegmentFirstIterator.needsCompaction` to `CompactionStatus` to improve testability and readability\r\n- Capture the list of checks performed to determine if compaction is needed in a readable manner in `CompactionStatus.CHECKS`\r\n- Make `CompactionSegmentIterator` iterate over instances of `SegmentsToCompact` instead of `List<DataSegment>`. This allows use of the `umbrellaInterval` later.\r\n- Replace usages of `QueueEntry` with `SegmentsToCompact` as they serve the same purpose\r\n- Move `SegmentsToCompact` out of `NewestSegmentFirstIterator`\r\n- Simplify `CompactionStatistics`\r\n- Reduce level of less important logs to debug\r\n- No change made to tests to ensure correctness\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Motivation\r\n\r\n- Some coordinator duties such as `CompactSegments` or `KillUnusedSegments` can be slow due to slowness on the Overlord or the metadata store.\r\n- This causes the coordinator executor to get blocked up thus delaying segment loading and hand-offs, which in turn causes ingestion failures.\r\n- With the introduction of custom coordinator duties, it becomes imperative to separate the executors to ensure that the core coordinator logic is never blocked.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Use separate executor for every duty group\r\n- This change is thread-safe as every duty group uses its own copy of `DruidCoordinatorRuntimeParams` and does not share any other mutable instances with other duty groups.\r\n- With the exception of `HistoricalManagementDuties`, duty groups are typically not very compute intensive and mostly perform database or HTTP I/O. So, coordinator resources would still mostly be available for `HistoricalManagementDuties`.\r\n\r\n### Alternative approach\r\nHave 1 executor for `HistoricalManagementDuties` and 1 for all other duty groups.\r\nHowever, this still allows users to schedule some custom duties that compete with say the `IndexingServiceDuties` or `MetadataStoreManagementDuties`.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTested locally on a small cluster with `coordinator.period`, `indexingPeriod` and `metadataStoreManagementPeriod`, all set to `PT5S`. Compaction, coordination working as expected.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

up PR to #12599 \r\n\r\nThat PR introduces some changes that can be simplified.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Rename column `used_flag_last_updated` to `used_status_last_updated`\r\n- Remove new CLI tool `UpdateTables`.\r\n  - We already have a `CreateTables` with similar functionality, which should be able to handle update cases too.\r\n  - Any user running the cluster for the first time should either just have `druid.metadata.storage.connector.createTables` enabled or run `CreateTables` which should create tables at the latest version.\r\n  - For instance, the `UpdateTables` tool would be inadequate when a new metadata table has been added to Druid, and users would have to run `CreateTables` anyway.\r\n- Remove `upgrade-prep.md` and include that info in `metadata-init.md`.  \r\n- Fix log messages to adhere to Druid style\r\n- Use lambdas\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-18T03:26:52Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:49:04Z","closed_at":"2023-08-18T18:30:05Z","merged_at":"2023-08-18T18:30:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"097b6450057426d21fbcaa8319ae582b33976690","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR removes the 'v1' grouping engine as well as the strategy selection abstraction. I found `GroupByStrategyV2` to still be a relatively handy thing to keep around since it is a nice container for grabbing the resources and stuff needed and plumbing to the underlying group by v2 engine, so I have transitioned it into a new class `GroupingEngine` which is now used in place of prior uses of `GroupByStrategySelector`. Alternatively its functionality could have been distributed among the query runner and toolchest, but it seemed a bit more disruptive.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nThe V1 group by query has been removed in favor of always using the V2 engine. Any query context parameters associated with it will now be ignored internally.\r\n\r\n`AggregatorFactory.getRequiredColumns` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you have an extension that implements `AggregatorFactory` then this method should be removed from your implementation (there is now a default definition that throws an exception about being deprecated).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

patch fixes a few issues toward #14858\r\n* some phony classes were added to enable maven to track the compilation of those classes\r\n* cyclonedx [2.7.9](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin/releases/tag/cyclonedx-maven-plugin-2.7.9) seem to handle incremental compilation better; it had a PR relating to that\r\n* needed to update root pom to `25`\r\n* update antlr to 4.5.3 \r\n  * older one didn't really worked incrementally; 4.5.3 works much better\r\n\r\n\r\nleft out:\r\n* update commit-id plugin to 6.0.0\r\n  * no idea what it was doing - but every module invoked it and it sit there for a few secs; newer version doesn't do this\r\n  * this was able to shave off around 8 seconds from the build time of these 4 modules\r\n  * unfortunately that version is not jdk8 compatible...so I had to remove it\r\n\r\n\r\nThese changes enable incremental compilation up to the `sql` module; where `javacc` regenerates some sources\r\n\r\n```\r\nclean=\"git clean -dfx\"\r\nbuild=\"mvn install -pl sql,!sql -am -Dtest=nonexistent -q -Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false -Pskip-static-checks\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n| cmd | base |

Motivation\r\n`testMigration` creates about 3k tasks and verifies their migration.

href=\"https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/releases\">com.ibm.icu:icu4j's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>ICU 73.2</h2>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Unicode® ICU 73.2. It updates to <a href=\"https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-43#h.qobmda543waj\">CLDR 43.1</a> locale data with various additions and corrections. These are maintenance releases for ICU 73 and CLDR 43, with limited sets of bug fixes and no API or structural changes.</p>\n<p>There are significant changes for <a href=\"https://ken-lunde.medium.com/the-gb-18030-2022-standard-3d0ebaeb4132\">GB18030-2022</a> compliance support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CLDR extends the support for “short” Chinese sort orders to cover some additional, required characters for Level 2. This is carried over into ICU collation.</li>\n<li>ICU has a modified character conversion table, mapping some GB18030 characters to Unicode characters that were encoded after GB18030-2005.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also changes for compatibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are optional variants of time formats with AM/PM (only for English) using ASCII spaces in CLDR that can also be used in ICU via custom data generation. This is intended to help certain implementers transition to the improved patterns, which have used a narrow no-break space between the time and AM/PM since <a href=\"https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-42#h.ck7cpcrqqrq0\">CLDR 42</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>For how to generate ICU data with this option, look for alt=&quot;ascii&quot; on<a href=\"https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/main/tools/cldr/cldr-to-icu/README.md\"> main/tools/cldr/cldr-to-icu/README.md</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The changes to the word segmentation behavior of @ sign that were in CLDR 42 (ICU 72) have been reverted. These caused problems for certain parsers that did not expect @ to join to letters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ICU 73.2 and CLDR 43.1 include several other bug fixes, including person name formatting, and Cyrillic transforms.</p>\n<p>For details, please see <a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/download/73\">https://icu.unicode.org/download/73</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The prebuilt WinARM64 binaries below should be considered alpha/experimental.</em></p>\n<h2>ICU 73.1</h2>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Unicode® ICU 73. It updates to <a href=\"https://blog.unicode.org/2023/04/the-unicode-cldr-v43-released.html\">CLDR 43</a> locale data with various additions and corrections.</p>\n<p>ICU 73 improves Japanese and Korean short-text line breaking, reduces C++ memory use in date formatting, and promotes the Java person name formatter from tech preview to draft.</p>\n<p>ICU 73 and CLDR 43 are minor releases, mostly focused on bug fixes and small enhancements. (The fall CLDR/ICU releases will update to Unicode 15.1 which is planned for September.)</p>\n<p>ICU 73 updates to the time zone data version 2023c (2023-mar). Note that pre-1970 data for a number of time zones has been removed, as has been the case in the upstream <a href=\"https://www.iana.org/time-zones\">tzdata</a> release since 2021b.</p>\n<p>For details, please see <a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/download/73\">https://icu.unicode.org/download/73</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The prebuilt WinARM64 binaries below should be considered alpha/experimental.</em></p>\n<h2>ICU 73 RC</h2>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the release candidate for Unicode® ICU 73.

is a current issue due to inconsistent metadata between worker and controller in MSQ. A controller can receive one set of segments, which are then marked as unused by, say, a compaction job. The worker would be unable to get the segment information as `MetadataResource`. \r\n\r\nThis PR resolves this by allowing the worker to fetch the segment information even if it is unused.\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n- Adds `includeUnused` as an optional parameter to the `org.apache.druid.server.http.MetadataResource#getSegment` coordinator API. The API will also return unused segments if the parameter is set.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR.

Motivation\r\n- Clean up `DruidCoordinator` and move methods to classes where they are most relevant\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n- No functional change\r\n- Add class `PrepareBalancerAndLoadQueues` which performs the same duty as `UpdateCoordinatorStateAndPrepareCluster`\r\n- Move creation, stopping and removal of `LoadQueuePeon`s from `DruidCoordinator` to `LoadQueueTaskMaster`\r\n- Make `BalancerStrategyFactory` an abstract class and move handling of the balancer executor here\r\n- Move reporting of used segment stats and historical capacity stats from `CollectSegmentAndServerStats` to `PrepareBalancerAndLoadQueues` as that is where the `DruidCluster` is created.\r\n- Move reporting of unavailable and under-replicated segment stats from `CollectSegmentAndServerStats` to `UpdateReplicationStatus` duty\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or

However, we must follow the ANTLR conventions here or the\nrelease numbers would quickly become confusing. I apologize for being unable to follow the Go release rules absolutely\nto the letter.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of changes and improvements in this release, but only the change of repo holding the runtime code,\nand possibly the removal of interfaces will cause any code changes. There are no breaking changes to the runtime\ninterfaces.</p>\n<p>ANTLR Go Maintainer: <a href=\"https://github.com/jimidle\">Jim Idle</a> - Email:  <a href=\"https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/dev/doc/mailto:jimi@idle.ws\">jimi@idle.ws</a></p>\n<h3>Code Relocation</h3>\n<p>For complicated reasons, including not breaking the builds of some users who use a monorepo and eschew modules, as well\nas not making substantial changes to the internal test suite, the Go runtime code will continue to be maintained in\nthe main ANTLR4 repo <code>antlr/antlr4</code>. If you wish to contribute changes to the Go runtime code, please continue to submit\nPRs to this main repo, against the <code>dev</code> branch.</p>\n<p>The code located in the main repo at about the depth of the Mariana Trench, means that the go tools cannot reconcile\nthe module correctly. After some debate, it was decided that we would create a dedicated release repo for the Go runtime\nso that it will behave exactly as the Go tooling expects. This repo is auto-maintained and keeps both the dev and master\nbranches up to date.</p>\n<p>Henceforth, all future projects using the ANTLR Go runtime, should import as follows:</p>\n<pre lang=\"go\"><code>import (\n    &quot;github.com/antlr4-go/antlr/v4&quot;\n    )\n</code></pre>\n<p>And use the command:</p>\n<pre lang=\"shell\"><code>go get github.com/antlr4-go/antlr\n</code></pre>\n<p>To get the module - <code>go mod tidy</code> is probably the best way once imports have been changed.</p>\n<p>Please note that there is no longer any source code kept in the ANTLR repo under <code>github.com/antlr/antlr4/runtime/Go/antlr</code>.\nIf you are using the code without modules, then sync the code from the new release repo.</p>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>Prior to this release, the godocs were essentially unusable as the go doc code was essentially copied without\nchange, from teh Java runtime. The godocs are now properly formatted for Go and pkg.dev.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to raise an issue if you find any remaining mistakes. Or submit a PR (remember - not to the new repo).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Description\r\n\r\nThis change enables the `KillUnusedSegments` coordinator duty to be scheduled continuously. Things that prevented this, or made this difficult before were the following:\r\n\r\n1. If scheduled at fast enough rate, the duty would find the same intervals to kill for the same datasources, while kill tasks submitted for those same datasources and intervals were already underway, thus wasting task slots on duplicated work.\r\n\r\n2. The task resources used by auto kill were previously unbounded.  Each duty run period, if unused\r\n segments were found for any datasource, a kill task would be submitted to kill them.\r\n\r\nThis pr solves for both of these issues:\r\n\r\n1. The duty keeps track of the end time of the last interval found when killing unused segments for each datasource, in a in memory map. The end time for each datasource, if found, is used as the start time lower bound, when searching for unused intervals for that same datasource. Each duty run, we remove any datasource keys from this map that are no longer found to match datasources in the system, or in whitelist, and also remove a datasource entry, if there is found to be no unused segments for the datasource, which happens when we fail to find an interval which includes unused segments. Removing the datasource entry from the map,  allows for searching for unusedSegments in the datasource from the beginning of time once again\r\n\r\n2. The unbounded task resource usage can be mitigated with coordinator dynamic config added as part of https://github.com/apache/druid/commit/ba957a9b97b6bdbecb166db771721cced1dac365\r\n\r\n\r\nOperators can configure continous auto kill by providing coordinator runtime properties similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndruid.coordinator.period.indexingPeriod=PT60S\r\ndruid.coordinator.kill.period=PT60S\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd providing sensible limits to the killTask usage via coordinator dynamic properties.\r\n\r\n### Release Note\r\n- The value of `druid.coordinator.kill.period` can now be as low as `druid.coordinator.period.indexingPeriod`. It was earlier required to be strictly greater than the `indexingPeriod`.\r\n- The leader Coordinator now keeps track of the last submitted `kill` task for a given datasource to avoid submitting duplicate kill tasks. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

We discovered many directories for tasks that ran long in past. After investigation, we determined that our index_hadoop jobs were not deleting the temp dir after the generate index MR job. After adding this patch into our fork, we confirmed that the temp dirs were properly cleaned up\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

For example: -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nFor each MR job, a \"temporary working directory for hadoop tasks\" is created. This is controlled via `druid.indexer.task.hadoopWorkingPath`. The contents of this directory during the task aren't relevant to this PR. Just the fact that it exists matters. At the end of the MR job, the directory is to be deleted since the files were only needed for the running of that one job.\r\n\r\n### Bug\r\n\r\nThe bug is that this temporary directory is not always cleaned up after the indexGenerator part of the index task runs. The root cause is that the indexGenerator MR job can set a dynamic version that strays from the version in the task spec. This version is used in the path for the aforementioned temporary working directory for a hadoop task. If the code that cleans up the temporary directory is not aware of the dynamic change of the version, the directory will not be cleaned up. Over time this leads to accumulation of useless files in HDFS.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nThe fix is super simple. We just need to honor the dynamic version when calling to cleanup after the indexGenerator task is complete. There is a little bit of ugliness to protect against an NPE that should be impossible, but the IDE complains so I put in some protection just in case.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.
