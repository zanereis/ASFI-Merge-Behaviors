default, when Spring parses a request mapping parameter at the end of a URL, it treats the last dot in the paramater value to be the start of a file extension, and discards the 'extension\" before passing the parameter to the handler method.\r\n\r\nSeveral of our configurable items allow dots in their IDs. And several of our REST request mappings place those IDs at the end of the URL. In those cases, Spring's default behavior truncates the ID at the last dot, and passes the truncated ID to the request handler. As a result, the request fails.                                                \r\n\r\nThis commit configure all current management REST API request mappings to allow dots in their final parameters.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Dale Emery <demery@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Jinmei Liao <jiliao@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Darrel Schneider <dschneider@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

part of eliminating `TcpServer` dependency on `geode-core`, this ticket removes `TcpServer` dependencies on `DataSerializable`.\r\n\r\nThe way we did that was to change the 6 message types used to talk to `TcpServer` so instead of deriving from `DataSerializable`—they now derive from a new `BasicSerializable` interface.\r\n\r\nThat interface is made a base for `DataSerializableFixedID`. Then we modified `geode-serialization` so it handles any `BasicSerializable` i.e. both the base type and the derived (`DataSerializableFixedID`) type. This entailed a few changes up in `geode-core`: primarily in `InternalDataSerializer`.\r\n\r\nThe six message types that are now `BasicSerializable` are:\r\n\r\n* `VersionRequest`/`Response`\r\n* `InfoRequest`/`Response`\r\n* `ShutdownRequest`/`Response`\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the on-the-wire format of the new `BasicSerializable` is the same as the old `DataSerializable`. This lets a new Geode and an old Geode communicate.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the `TcpServer` package no longer depends on anything in `geode-core` and `TcpServer` and friends (in `org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.tcpserver`)  are ready to move to their very own new module (in a future PR).\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR implements the first half of [GEODE-7344](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-7344), to wit, eliminating dependencies on `DataSerializer` from classes in the `org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.tcpserver` package.\r\n\r\nThe main change is that now we are injecting an `ObjectSerializer` and an `ObjectDeserializer` into the `TcpClient` constructor in order to break the dependency from the latter to the `DataSerializer` class. Also `TcpServer` got the same treatment!\r\n\r\nI'd like to get this approved and merged before tackling the harder second half (eliminating dependencies on `DataSerializable`).\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

expansion logic for the decrypted buffer in NioSslEngine was\r\nexpanding the buffer to twice its old capacity and wouldn't go\r\nbeyond that.  Some ciphers will compress data a lot more than that, so\r\nwe need to continually increase available space in the decryption buffer\r\nif the SslEngine reports a BUFFER_OVERFLOW status.  The changes in\r\nthis commit do that by always doubling the available space in the\r\ndecryption buffer in response to a BUFFER_OVERFLOW.\r\n\r\nAlong with that I found it unnecessary to take preemptive action to\r\nincrease the size of the buffer and deleted that code.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

with having only two wiki pages (one generated from master and one from develop) had two drawbacks:\r\n1) could not generate docs until after release shipped\r\n2) could not link to previous doc version when they get overwritten, because confluence doesn't seem to support a url syntax to refer to page version in history, and even if it did, it would be clunky\r\n3) it was confusing that develop was a sub-page of 1.10.0\r\n \r\nNow, one wiki page per release version must be (manually) allocated and added to the script, but now it generate the wiki page from develop, master, or an active release branch, so that docs can be made available earlier in the release process.\r\n\r\nSee new page tree at

preparation to put `TcpServer` and `TcpClient` into their own module, this PR breaks dependencies from those classes, to classes in `geode-core`.\r\n\r\nIn the nascent `geode-tcp-server` module, replace usages of the (broad) `SocketCreator` class (from `geode-core`) with usages of a new (narrow) [`TcpSocketCreator`](geode-core/src/main/java/org/apache/geode/distributed/internal/tcpserver/TcpSocketCreator.java) interface.\r\n\r\nThis means injecting (a reference to an object implementing that interface) everywhere we were formerly creating an instance of `SocketCreator`.
