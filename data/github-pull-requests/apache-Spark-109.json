What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark runtime filter supports bloom filter and in subquery filter.\r\nThe in subquery filter always execute `Murmur3Hash` before aggregate the join key.\r\n\r\nBecause the data size before aggregate lager than after, we can only execute `Murmur3Hash` for aggregation and it will reduce the number of calls to `Murmur3Hash` and improve performance.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove performance for semi-join runtime filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, existing `LiteralExpression` is a mixture of `Literal`, `CreateArray`, `CreateStruct` and `CreateMap`, since we have added collection functions `array`, `struct` and `create_map`, the `CreateXXX` expressions can be replaced with `UnresolvedFunction`; \r\n2, add field `dataType` in `LiteralExpression`, so we can specify the DataType if needed, a special case is the typed null;\r\n3, it is up to the `lit` function to infer the DataType, not `LiteralExpression` itself;\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRefactor LiteralExpression to support DataType\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, `LiteralExpression` is a internal class, should not expose to end users\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to merge namespaces between Spark Connect and PySpark with adding an CLI option `--remote` and `spark.remote` configuration as a symmetry of `--master` and `spark.master`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to provide the same user experience to the end users, see also the design document attached ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10XJFHnzH8a1cQq9iDf9KORAveK6uy6mBvWA8zZP7rjc/edit?usp=sharing)).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users now can use Spark Connect as below:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/pyspark --remote ... \r\n$ ./bin/pyspark --conf spark.remote ...\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n>>> # **Same as regular PySpark from here**\r\n... # Do something with `spark` that is a remote client\r\n... spark.range(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-submit --remote ... app.py\r\n$ ./bin/spark-submit --conf spark.remote ... app.py\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n# **Same as regular PySpark from here**\r\n# app.py\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\n# Do something with `spark` that is a remote client\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the design document attached ([here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10XJFHnzH8a1cQq9iDf9KORAveK6uy6mBvWA8zZP7rjc/edit?usp=sharing)).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nReusing PySpark unittests of DataFrame and functions.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-13T00:28:15Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:49:23Z","closed_at":"2022-12-21T00:13:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29ae36b8a4157a619253859dd3eafa35f03d9499","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39041/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39041/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39041/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/05467abf1409c3fdd48c7df8791f592504d967d9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:prototype_merged_pyspark","ref":"prototype_merged_pyspark","sha":"05467abf1409c3fdd48c7df8791f592504d967d9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the implicit lateral column alias on `Aggregate` case. For example,\r\n```sql\r\n-- LCA in Aggregate. The avg_salary references an attribute defined by a previous alias\r\nSELECT dept, average(salary) AS avg_salary, avg_salary + average(bonus)\r\nFROM employee\r\nGROUP BY dept\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe high level implementation idea is to insert the `Project` node above, and falling back to the resolution of lateral alias of Project code path in the last PR.\r\n\r\n* Phase 1: recognize resolved lateral alias, wrap the attributes referencing them with `LateralColumnAliasReference`\r\n* Phase 2: when the `Aggregate` operator is resolved, it goes through the whole aggregation list, extracts the aggregation expressions and grouping expressions to keep them in this `Aggregate` node, and add a `Project` above with the original output. It doesn't do anything on `LateralColumnAliasReference`, but completely leave it to the Project in the future turns of this rule.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n // Before rewrite:\r\n Aggregate [dept#14] [dept#14 AS a#12, 'a + 1, avg(salary#16) AS b#13, 'b + avg(bonus#17)]\r\n +- Child [dept#14,name#15,salary#16,bonus#17]\r\n\r\n // After phase 1:\r\n Aggregate [dept#14] [dept#14 AS a#12, lca(a) + 1, avg(salary#16) AS b#13, lca(b) + avg(bonus#17)]\r\n +- Child [dept#14,name#15,salary#16,bonus#17]\r\n\r\n // After phase 2:\r\n Project [dept#14 AS a#12, lca(a) + 1, avg(salary)#26 AS b#13, lca(b) + avg(bonus)#27]\r\n +- Aggregate [dept#14] [avg(salary#16) AS avg(salary)#26, avg(bonus#17) AS avg(bonus)#27, dept#14]\r\n     +- Child [dept#14,name#15,salary#16,bonus#17]\r\n\r\n // Now the problem falls back to the lateral alias resolution in Project.\r\n // After future rounds of this rule:\r\n Project [a#12, a#12 + 1, b#13, b#13 + avg(bonus)#27]\r\n +- Project [dept#14 AS a#12, avg(salary)#26 AS b#13]\r\n    +- Aggregate [dept#14] [avg(salary#16) AS avg(salary)#26, avg(bonus#17) AS avg(bonus)#27, dept#14]\r\n       +- Child [dept#14,name#15,salary#16,bonus#17]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilar as the last PR (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38776), because lateral column alias has higher resolution priority than outer reference, it will try to resolve an `OuterReference` using lateral column alias, similar as an `UnresolvedAttribute`. If success, it strips `OuterReference` and also wraps it with `LateralColumnAliasReference`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimilar as stated in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38776.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, as shown in the above example, it will be able to resolve lateral column alias in Aggregate.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests and newly added tests.","created_at":"2022-12-13T00:00:45Z","updated_at":"2022-12-21T02:54:05Z","closed_at":"2022-12-21T02:54:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a592d04c604b1ecea66f46395b003905190fb4f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b200da0fd23a9e6e4f2cc6b32fa66b176efb5820","head":{"label":"anchovYu:SPARK-27561-agg","ref":"SPARK-27561-agg","sha":"b200da0fd23a9e6e4f2cc6b32fa66b176efb5820","user":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286528918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODY1Mjg5MTg=","name":"spark","full_name":"anchovYu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr fixs two issues when cache enable AQE\r\n1. Make AQE propagate the SQL metrics which is in InMemoryTableScan\r\n   We do not propagate SQL metrics if the current execution id is not mapping to current query execution. The AdaptiveSparkPlanExec in InMemoryTableScan does not have its own query execution id. So we missed that SQL metrics.\r\n A simaple case is:\r\n```\r\n          ...\r\n           |\r\n  AdaptiveSparkPlanExec (queryexecution 0, no execution id)\r\n           |\r\n  InMemoryTableScanExec\r\n           |\r\n          ...\r\n           |\r\n  AdaptiveSparkPlanExec (queryexecution 1, execution id 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Update final plan if contains InMemoryTableScan\r\n   We only update final plan if contains subquery to avoid unnecessary `SparkListenerSQLAdaptiveExecutionUpdate` event, however, the AdaptiveSparkPlanExec missed updating if the final stage incude InMemoryTableScan.\r\n A simaple case is:\r\n```\r\n          ...\r\n           |\r\n  AdaptiveSparkPlanExec\r\n           |\r\n  InMemoryTableScanExec\r\n           |\r\n      ProjectExec\r\n           |\r\n  AdaptiveSparkPlanExec\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCorrect the plan and metrics if cache enable AQE. And make Spark UI work. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, after this pr, the Spark UI show the correct plan and metrics with AQE cache.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd test and manually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR unify the environment variable of `*_PROTOC_EXEC_PATH` to support that users can use the same environment variable to build and test `core`,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the stop method of SparkContext, a timeout limit is added to metricsSystem#report. When it is not completed for more than 1s, continue with the subsequent steps.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen the user does not explicitly call the stop method of SparkContext, the stop will be executed by ShutdownHook, and the Hadoop shutdown hookmanager used by Spark needs to complete the hook entry within 10s, so when the metricsSystem takes a long time to complete the report (for example, the sink occurs time out), other hooks may be blocked and cannot be executed successfully.\r\n\r\nFor example, the unregister operation in ApplicationMaster may fail to execute because the metrics report costs too much time, so the Spark job has been successfully completed, but Yarn still considers it a failed job.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\ntest manually, due to the difficulty of constructing the timeout execution of metrics#report.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36012 already added a check to avoid adding expressions containing `PlanExpression`s to `EquivalentExpressions` as those expressions might cause NPE on executors. But, for some reason, the check is still missing from `getExprState()` where we check the presence of an experssion in the equivalence map.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- adds the check to `getExprState()`\r\n- moves the check from `updateExprTree()` to `addExprTree()` so as to run it only once.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid exceptions like:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is technically a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29196 that changes Scala Style configuration to catch `AnyFunSuite` instead of `FunSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the original intention of the Scala style configuration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with `./dev/lint-scala`. CI in this PR should test it out too.","created_at":"2022-12-09T10:26:37Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:49:31Z","closed_at":"2022-12-09T17:31:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0bea9bba4bc51c5bd6189f341967dd438e1af5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39004/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39004/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39004/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a399a2f06599af134c300e8742c2393a1a2b0732","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-41466","ref":"SPARK-41466","sha":"a399a2f06599af134c300e8742c2393a1a2b0732","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change `prettyName` of `StringDecode` to `decode` to keep the name as was. It was changed from SPARK-33527.\r\n\r\nNote that I don't change `nodeName` here to keep the strings in the plan to differentiate `Decode` from `StringDecode`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is technically a beahviour change (or regression) from SPARK-33527 although we don't guarantee the compatibility there.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it changes the default output column name from `stringdecode` to `decode`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRelates unittests were fixed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR use profile named `-Puser-defined-protoc` to support that users can build and test `core` module by specifying custom `protoc` executables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs described in [SPARK-41461](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41461), the latest versions of `protoc` have the minimum version requirements for basic libraries such as `glibc` and `glibcxx`. Because of that it is not possible to compile the `core` module out of the box on CentOS 6 or CentOS 7. Instead the following error messages is shown:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] /home/disk1/spark-ut/spark/core/src/main/protobuf/org/apache/spark/status/protobuf/store_types.proto [0:0]:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nA follow-up on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38966 to update relevant documentation and remove redundant sort key.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor isotonic regression, another method for breaking ties of repeated features was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38966. This will aggregate points having the same feature value by computing the weighted average of the labels.\r\n- This only requires points to be sorted by features instead of features and labels. So, we should remove label as a secondary sorting key.\r\n- Isotonic regression documentation needs to be updated to reflect the new behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIsotonic regression documentation update. The documentation described the behavior of the algorithm when there are points in the input with repeated features. Since this behavior has changed, documentation needs to describe the new behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests passed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new layer `IsolatedThreadSafeRpcEndpoint` to extend `IsolatedRpcEndpoint` and changes all the endpoints which currently extend `IsolatedRpcEndpoint` to extend `IsolatedThreadSafeRpcEndpoint` instead. Besides, `IsolatedThreadSafeRpcEndpoint` has overridden `def threadCount(): Int = 1` with `final` to avoid mistakenly having thread count > 1 for the thread-safe endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBusy endpoints like `DriverEndpoint`, `BlockManagerMasterEndpoint` were known to be thread-safe when they extended `ThreadSafeRpcEndpoint`. After we introduce `IsolatedRpcEndpoint` in [SPARK-29398](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29398),  all these busy endpoints have been changed to extend `IsolatedRpcEndpoint`. These busy endpoints are still thread-safe since `IsolatedRpcEndpoint` by default only uses 1 thread. But that's not explicit to developers now compared to `ThreadSafeRpcEndpoint` (I actually find some people became to be confused about whether the endpoint is thread-safe or not). From time to time, `IsolatedRpcEndpoint#threadCount` might be mistakenly overridden with threadCount > 1 leading to thread-safety being broken. So this PR refactor here a bit to avoid the potential issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to:\r\n\r\n- Print out the correct error message when dependencies are not installed for `pyspark.sql.connect` in main code.\r\n- Print out the correct message if 1. dependencies are missing or 2. build is not there in Spark Connect in tests.\r\n- Ignore all MyPy errors from tests:\r\n  - Initial intention was to annotate types for public APIs only.\r\n  - Also removed unused ignores in other modules\r\n\r\nNote that, for Spark Connect, we should follow both below to make sure they are properly skipped when dependences are not there, or jars do not exist.\r\n- Always use `if should_test_connect` for `pyspark.sql.connect` and related dependency imports in tests.\r\n- Use `@unittest.skipIf(not should_test_connect, connect_requirement_message)`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- To make the development easier and faster.\r\n- To make sure our Jenkins build pass without Python dependencies installed\r\n  - See [Scaleaway](https://apache-spark.s3.fr-par.scw.cloud/index.html), see also https://github.com/apache/spark-website/blob/asf-site/developer-tools.md#test-coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev and test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested without pandas, pyarrow and grpc, and verified the error messages.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-09T06:43:34Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:49:30Z","closed_at":"2022-12-10T05:35:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5694dfb5a606749bf4050898b55ae11d414d1dff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor try_cast and the legacy cast (cast with ANSI SQL mode off), there are conversions which has the same behaviors:\r\n\r\n- cast(string as date/timestamp/TimestampNTZ)\r\n- cast(string as double/float/decimal)\r\n\r\nSo, the try_cast can be faster if it uses the evaluation code path of the legacy cast, instead of turning into ANSI cast and catching exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor better performance of `try_cast(string as datetime|Fractional numeric)`.\r\nI also observed performance regression for the method summary() after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35699 under ANSI SQL mode. The `try...catch` is actually unnecessary. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

Lang3 which fixed [LANG-1463](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-1463), but considering the following facts, I strongly suggest to avoid using empty abbrevMarker in `StringUtils.abbreviate`.\r\n\r\n- I suppose the trim algorithm of long app name is some kind of Spark internal implementation, this change should not affect Spark users.\r\n- It's a common case that users or vendors want to tune the version of some dependencies because they need to align w/ other components, this change makes the Spark compatible w/ Apache Commons Lang3 3.6~3.9 as well(specific to this case).\r\n- For those developers who are used to creating \"fat jar\" but w/o properly class relocation, a \"StringUtils\" class may be shipped by the \"fat jar\", supposing the \"fat jar\" is a plugin of Spark and it was added into `SPARK_HOME/jars`, then Spark has a chance to load that bad class, then trigger the bug. (actually we are in such situation, I know we should not blame Spark, but this PR makes Spark much tolerated) \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen restarting the history server, In history server log,\r\nwe can see many `INFO FsHIstoryProvider: Finished parsing application_xxx` followed by\r\n`INFO FsHIstoryProvider: Deleting expired event log for application_xxx`.\r\nThis is caused by the expired and unlisted log files also be parsed, and then execute `checkAndCleanLog` to delete parsed info, this means that the parsing is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIf there are a large number of expired log files in the log directory, it will affect the speed of replay.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this, we can add a logic to clean up these expired log files before calling `doMergeApplicationListing`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n    \r\n    Reduce the number of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport #38901 to branch-3.2.\r\n\r\nFix the condition for judging Netty prefer direct memory on executor start, the logic should match `org.apache.spark.network.client.TransportClientFactory`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe check logical was added in SPARK-27991, the original intention is to avoid potential Netty OOM issue when Netty uses direct memory to consume shuffle data, but the condition is not sufficient, this PR updates the logic to match `org.apache.spark.network.client.TransportClientFactory`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport #38901 to branch-3.3.\r\n\r\nFix the condition for judging Netty prefer direct memory on executor start, the logic should match `org.apache.spark.network.client.TransportClientFactory`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe check logical was added in SPARK-27991, the original intention is to avoid potential Netty OOM issue when Netty uses direct memory to consume shuffle data, but the condition is not sufficient, this PR updates the logic to match `org.apache.spark.network.client.TransportClientFactory`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch updates how `SQLMetric` merges two invalid instances where the value is both -1.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe use -1 as initial value of `SQLMetric`, and change it to 0 while merging with other `SQLMetric` instances. A `SQLMetric` will be treated as invalid and filtered out later.\r\n\r\nWhile we are developing with Spark, it is trouble behavior that two invalid `SQLMetric` instances merge to a valid `SQLMetric` because merging will set the value to 0.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR supports `Generate` with no required child output to host outer references. It updates DecorrelateInnerQuery to handle Generate and adds a new optimization for Generate and OneRowRelation in rule OptimizeOneRowRelationSubquery.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, CheckAnalysis allows `Generate` with no required child output to host outer references. However,  DecorrelateInnerQuery does not handle this case correctly.  For example\r\n```\r\nselect * from t, lateral (select explode(array(c1, c2)))\r\n```\r\nThis will throw an internal error:\r\n```\r\nAssertionError: assertion failed: Correlated column is not allowed in Generate\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests and SQL query

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdding a pre-processing step to isotonic regression in mllib to handle duplicate features. This is to match `sklearn` implementation. Input points of duplicate feature values are aggregated into a single point using as label the weighted average of the labels of the points with duplicate feature values. All points for a unique feature values are aggregated as:\r\n - Aggregated label is the weighted average of all labels\r\n - Aggregated feature is the weighted average of all equal features. It is possible that feature values to be equal up to a resolution due to representation errors, since we cannot know which feature value to use in that case, we compute the weighted average of the features. Ideally, all feature values will be equal and the weighted average is just the value at any point.\r\n - Aggregated weight is the sum of all weights\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs per discussion on ticket [[SPARK-41008]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41008), it is a bug and results should match `sklearn`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThere are no changes to the API, documentation or error messages. However, the user should expect results to change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting test cases for duplicate features failed. These tests were adjusted accordingly. Also, new tests are added.\r\n\r\nHere is a python snippet that can be used to verify the results:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.isotonic import IsotonicRegression\r\n\r\ndef test(x, y, x_test, isotonic=True):\r\n    ir = IsotonicRegression(out_of_bounds='clip', increasing=isotonic).fit(x, y)\r\n    y_test = ir.predict(x_test)\r\n    \r\n    def print_array(label, a):\r\n

partitions.\r\nwe except that all of partitions size should be bigger than `spark.sql.adaptive.rebalancePartitionsSmallPartitionFactor` and smaller than `spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes` when we use rebalance(column) in our Spark-SQL.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n No.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTransforms the SelfJoin resulting in duplicate rows used for IN predicate to aggregation.\r\nFor IN predicate, duplicate rows does not have any value. It will be overhead.\r\n\r\nEx: TPCDS Q95: following CTE is used only in IN predicates for only one column comparison ({@code ws_order_number}).\r\nThis results in exponential increase in Joined rows with too many duplicate rows.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWITH ws_wh AS\r\n(\r\n       SELECT ws1.ws_order_number,\r\n              ws1.ws_warehouse_sk wh1,\r\n              ws2.ws_warehouse_sk wh2\r\n       FROM   web_sales ws1,\r\n              web_sales ws2\r\n       WHERE  ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number\r\n       AND    ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould be optimized as below:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWITH ws_wh AS\r\n    (SELECT ws_order_number\r\n      FROM  web_sales\r\n      GROUP BY ws_order_number\r\n      HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ws_warehouse_sk) > 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptimized CTE scans table only once and results in unique rows.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOptimize TPCDS Q95,  reference code  \r\nhttps://github.com/rohankumardubey/hetu/blob/master/presto-main/src/main/java/io/prestosql/sql/planner/iterative/rule/TransformUnCorrelatedInPredicateSubQuerySelfJoinToAggregate.java\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded
