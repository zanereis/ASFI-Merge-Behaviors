To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nOnly for checking the CI-validation for every independent commit.","created_at":"2024-01-30T11:49:48Z","updated_at":"2024-07-04T13:32:47Z","closed_at":"2024-07-04T13:32:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"898ad5649e972fc5adc58b01aee0db1706c0b77b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24229/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24229/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24229/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f2e588475ed2d0e39f8828a9d6bc4db16f3d5d07","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:FLINK-33386-review-debug-0124.0130_splited_commits_forCI","ref":"FLINK-33386-review-debug-0124.0130_splited_commits_forCI","sha":"f2e588475ed2d0e39f8828a9d6bc4db16f3d5d07","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

to force registration of Avro serializer with Kryo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently the avro serializers is registered with Kryo if flink-avro is on the classpath. This also happens if avro isn't even used by the job, be it due to a mistake in the dependencies setup, branching or flink-avro being in lib. This forces users to always provide flink-avro going forward for affected jobs, because on recovery Flink complains if any of the Kryo serializers cant be loaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce a new config option that controls whether or not register avro to KryoSerializer.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nBasically covered by existing tests, while also adding some unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-30T08:45:47Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:55:55Z","closed_at":"2024-03-19T05:20:39Z","merged_at":"2024-03-19T05:20:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd382894b4da5b2d153913c92b6679fbd877b18b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f2c2765de2d7868e48527863bd6295556c268994","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:pr34121","ref":"pr34121","sha":"f2c2765de2d7868e48527863bd6295556c268994","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdds documentation for `AsyncScalarFunction`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-30T07:11:19Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:55:56Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b5df47beab3665987608182fbbb4c8753f525bdf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24224/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24224/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24224/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/148a4dbe60acaa9ca17f3e68930b8969dd5c170c","head":{"label":"AlanConfluent:add_docs_async_scalar","ref":"add_docs_async_scalar","sha":"148a4dbe60acaa9ca17f3e68930b8969dd5c170c","user":{"login":"AlanConfluent","id":57688982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg4OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57688982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":572267320,"node_id":"R_kgDOIhwbOA","name":"flink","full_name":"AlanConfluent/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlanConfluent","id":57688982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg4OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57688982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdded charset configuration support for csv format with file system source.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added CHARSET configuration option for CSVFormatOptions\r\n- Added withCharset method in CsvReaderFormat, and construct the corresponding MappingIterator with the designated charset.\r\n- Added charset support cor constructing CsvReaderFormat in CsvFileFormatFactory.\r\n- Added documents.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added UT for reading CSV with GBK encoding.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-30T02:11:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T13:00:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"acb28468483088854c83ae14ac2b0a5e92795860","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273335481,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM1NDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/FileSystem","name":"component=Connectors/FileSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9b5ce2ed53d2cd45b7ff1a11f11855ddcc8d18ed","head":{"label":"paul8263:FLINK-26760","ref":"FLINK-26760","sha":"9b5ce2ed53d2cd45b7ff1a11f11855ddcc8d18ed","user":{"login":"paul8263","id":7007327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDczMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7007327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263","html_url":"https://github.com/paul8263","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321848988,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE4NDg5ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"paul8263/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"paul8263","id":7007327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDczMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7007327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263","html_url":"https://github.com/paul8263","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/paul8263/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nAdds some restore tests for StreamExecAsyncCalc, which is utilized by using `AsyncScalarFunction`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-30T01:52:31Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:56:00Z","closed_at":"2024-02-06T17:53:36Z","merged_at":"2024-02-06T17:53:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"4264c30d367c1847d702ea5438da64876559a95d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24220/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24220/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24220/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e8bd321741e67502dcc8f1325e44e11e95de61ad","head":{"label":"AlanConfluent:restore_tests_async_calc","ref":"restore_tests_async_calc","sha":"e8bd321741e67502dcc8f1325e44e11e95de61ad","user":{"login":"AlanConfluent","id":57688982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg4OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57688982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":572267320,"node_id":"R_kgDOIhwbOA","name":"flink","full_name":"AlanConfluent/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlanConfluent","id":57688982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg4OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57688982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add a test to verify if restore test exists for ExecNode. This is as part of the Restore test completeness*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll existing restore tests PRs have been merged. There is a SKIP_LIST for python based exec nodes as well as a couple of them which might get merged in 2 weeks.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-34263\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFix error description in documentation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects the Retract Example in [TableAggregateFunction](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/table/functions/udfs/#retraction-example).\r\n\r\nThis is because `GroupTableAggFuction` will not reinvoke `getAccumulators` after `emitValue` is called.\r\n\r\nSee GroupTableAggFuction L#142~ L#146\r\n```java\r\n// get accumulator\r\naccumulators = function.getAccumulators(); // function\r\nif (!recordCounter.recordCountIsZero(accumulators)) {\r\n    function.emitValue(out, currentKey, false); \r\n    // update the state\r\n    accState.update(accumulators);\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUpdate doc\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe old example cannot generate the expected results. After correcting the example, it works.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nChange standard YAML parser to support YAML 1.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Change snakeyaml to snakeyaml engine 2.6 to support YAML 1.2\r\n  - Change pyyaml to ruamel.yaml 0.18.4 to support YAML 1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by YamlParserUtilsTest#testYaml12Features\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen using MiniCluster mode, file descriptors like /tmp/minicluster_6e62ab17ab058e0d5df56b97e9ccef71/tm_0/localState are not released after a Job completes.

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, the lastRecordTime variable, which tracks the time of the last received data element, is updated only when the WatermarkStatus transitions from IDLE to ACTIVE. However, it is not updated when WatermarkStatus is ACTIVE, which means even under continuous data flow, the condition `(currentTime - lastRecordTime > idleTimeout)` will eventually always become true, and the WatermarkStatus will erroneously be marked IDLE.\r\n\r\nI believe this bug technically causes incorrect outputs since downstream watermarks advance earlier than they otherwise would. The incorrect state doesn't last forever, though, since when the WatermarkStatus is in in the IDLE state, the next processElement will cause a WatermarkStatus.ACTIVE to be emitted. \r\n\r\nThe new unit test illustrates the flip-flop behavior before the fix:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.flink.table.runtime.operators.wmassigners.WatermarkAssignerOperatorTest.testIdleStateAvoidanceWithConsistentDataFlow -- Time elapsed: 0.013 s <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError:\r\n\r\nExpecting\r\n  [WatermarkStatus(IDLE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(ACTIVE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(IDLE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(ACTIVE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(IDLE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(ACTIVE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(IDLE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(ACTIVE),\r\n    WatermarkStatus(IDLE)]\r\nnot to contain\r\n  [WatermarkStatus(IDLE)]\r\nbut found\r\n  [WatermarkStatus(IDLE)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Update lastRecordTime in table WatermarkAssignerOperator on each record to prevent the stream from incorrectly being marked idle\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test that validates the WatermarkStatus is not set to idle when records are sent more frequently than the idleTimeout\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-29T02:15:14Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T02:14:10Z","closed_at":"2024-06-14T13:39:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a8833ae4fe3f313eaf20e81fbadf856671442d4","assignee":{"login":"1996fanrui","id":38427477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI3NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38427477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui","html_url":"https://github.com/1996fanrui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"1996fanrui","id":38427477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI3NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38427477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui","html_url":"https://github.com/1996fanrui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3b898a0c74a5dcb957ab7ab30b79dd82d01e8c0e","head":{"label":"dchristle:dchristle/FLINK-34252","ref":"dchristle/FLINK-34252","sha":"3b898a0c74a5dcb957ab7ab30b79dd82d01e8c0e","user":{"login":"dchristle","id":5257839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTc4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5257839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle","html_url":"https://github.com/dchristle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":522124009,"node_id":"R_kgDOHx766Q","name":"flink","full_name":"dchristle/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dchristle","id":5257839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTc4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5257839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle","html_url":"https://github.com/dchristle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchristle/received_events","type":"User","u

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nInclude flink-connector-datagen for AsyncIO example to fix dep missing problem and bundle it into the dist by default.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Use maven shade to package AsyncIO example instead, including flink-connector-datagen deps.\r\n\r\nNote that it was not bundled with the dist previously because we will only bundle those example jars with shortened names using the rewrite rule:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<!--simplify the name of example JARs for build-target/examples -->\r\n\t\t\t<plugin>\r\n\t\t\t\t<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\r\n\t\t\t\t<artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>\r\n\t\t\t\t<executions>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<execution>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<id>rename</id>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<configuration>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<target>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<copy file=\"${project.basedir}/target/flink-examples-streaming-${project.version}-WindowJoin.jar\" tofile=\"${project.basedir}/target/WindowJoin.jar\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<copy file=\"${project.basedir}/target/flink-examples-streaming-${project.version}-WordCount.jar\" tofile=\"${project.basedir}/target/WordCount.jar\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<copy file=\"${project.basedir}/target/flink-examples-streaming-${project.version}-SocketWindowWordCount.jar\" tofile=\"${project.basedir}/target/SocketWindowWordCount.jar\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</target>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</configuration>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</execution>\r\n\t\t\t\t</executions>\r\n\t\t\t</plugin>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change also integrates the name rewriting rule in the shade plugin config so that it is bundled by default.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually verified it by submitting it to a standalone cluster. Note that since the AsyncIO example itself mocks instable connection randomly, the job will soon fail on its own.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs a result of the changes implemented in [FLINK-32821](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32821), the build process no longer produces artifacts with the names flink-examples-streaming-1.x-yyy.jar. These artifacts were previously available and may still be expected by users as part of their application dependencies. Their removal could potentially break existing build pipelines and applications that depend on these example JARs.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Add the following config to each example's maven shade config:\r\n```xml\r\n<configuration>\r\n    <shadedArtifactAttached>true</shadedArtifactAttached>\r\n    <shadedClassifierName>$example-name</shadedClassifierName>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n2. Add a hotfix commit to additionally document why MatrixVectorMul example is not bundled with Flink dist nor deployed in Maven repo: it is platform-dependent, we expect users to compile and run it by themselves with custom jcuda version specified.\r\n\r\n**Explanation**: \r\n\r\nAfter invertigation, it turned out that the issue was resulted as follows:\r\n\r\n- The maven shade plugin will by default shade replaces with original jar with the result of shading. So, when a pom.xml includes two shades, the second shade execution will (by default) start from the result of the first shade execution ([ref](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/faq.html)).\r\n- We set the [finalName](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/shade-mojo.html#finalName) param to prevent the file replacement behavior as we'd like to build multiple independent example jars.\r\nHowever, maven by default will only install the default project artifact into the repo, omitting those shaded artifacts with finalName specified. This leads to the problem as reported in this issue.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, we can set the [shadedArtifactAttached](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/attached-artifact.html) param, which tells maven to install the shaded artifact aside from the default project artifact.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nBefore the change:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"603\" alt=\"截屏2024-01-27 23 52 04\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/22020529/c3eadef8-df77-48a3-bc7a-7bcb2784d233\">\r\n\r\nAfter the change:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"729\" alt=\"截屏2024-01-28 00 06 18\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/22020529/fee1048e-da7f-4beb-a78a-e9a226520589\">\r\n\r\nAnd the installed jar includes the datagen connector class files as expected:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"818\" alt=\"截屏2024-01-28 00 08 42\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/22020529/28896c5f-97f2-4782-8b96-c6f5ec689f24\">\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently the ClosureCleaner throws exception if {{checkSerializable} is enabled while some object is non-serializable. It includes the non-serializable (nested) object in the exception in the exception message.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the user job program gets more complex pulling multiple operators each of which pulls multiple 3rd party libraries, it is unclear how the non-serializable object is referenced as some of those objects could be nested in multiple levels. For example, following exception is not straightforward where to check:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.flink.api.common.InvalidProgramException: java.lang.Object@528c868 is not serializable. \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to include the reference stack in the exception message, as following:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.flink.api.common.InvalidProgramException: java.lang.Object@72437d8d is not serializable.\r\nReferenced via [class com.mycompany.myapp.ComplexMap, class com.mycompany.myapp.LocalMap,\r\nclass com.yourcompany.yourapp.YourPojo, class com.hercompany.herapp.Random, class java.lang.Object]...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is largely covered by existing tests, and new test case was added to `ClosureCleanerTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove DefaultSlotTracker related logic.  \r\n\r\nThe main reason for initiating this ticket is   \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-31449  &  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-34174\r\n(IIUC) as the current related logic is no longer being used.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRemove DefaultSlotTracker related logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for ChangelogNormalize node*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for ChangelogNormalize node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBugfix for FLINK-33263. Update the flink shaded guava version used in `SourceTransformationWrapper` to 32.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Update the flink shaded guava version used in `SourceTransformationWrapper` to 32.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified through CI progress.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nChange standard YAML parser to support YAML 1.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Change snakeyaml to snakeyaml engine 2.6 to support YAML 1.2\r\n  - Change pyyaml to ruamel.yaml 0.18.4 to support YAML 1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-26T06:30:36Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T06:21:17Z","closed_at":"2024-01-29T06:21:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"056e5572baec93b79188fd4e9036b30b58bc3e80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24199/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24199/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24199/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e9bd34e8bd33aba92ffcbd3c9e49c32fde27a3e0","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:update_to_yaml1.2","ref":"update_to_yaml1.2","sha":"e9bd34e8bd33aba92ffcbd3c9e49c32fde27a3e0","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

accumulates data in `currentInputFiles` and only rolls them into `inputFiles` when `snapshotState()` gets called.

If the job terminates, the final `EndCheckpoint` can arrive before the `snapshotState()` gets called.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\nWe removed the option to set JAVA_HOME in the config file with commit [24091](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24091) to improve how we handle standard YAML with BashJavaUtils. But since setting JAVA_HOME is a publicly documented feature, we need to keep it available for users. This pull request brings back the support for defining JAVA_HOME in the configuration files, keeping our public API consistent.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAssuming the env.java.home configuration must be flat, we initially employ a shell script to extract the user-defined JAVA_HOME from the configuration file. This approach allows us to directly access the custom Java home setting specified by the user before any internal handling of the configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDeprecate old serialization config methods and options listed in [FLIP-398](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-398%3A+Improve+Serialization+Configuration+And+Usage+In+Flink).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Deprecate old serialization config methods and options listed in [FLIP-398](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-398%3A+Improve+Serialization+Configuration+And+Usage+In+Flink).\r\n2. Migration usage of the old config options in UTs to the new option.\r\n3. Mark the corresponding methods in `SerializerConfig` as `@Internal` so that they can be converted to private methods after their deprecated caller methods in `ExecutionConfig` are removed in the next major Flink version.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) yes\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nI used to generate Flink config docs with the command listed in flink-docs README: \r\n\"mvn package -Dgenerate-config-docs -pl flink-docs -am -nsu DskipTests\". The command will compile Flink web frontend, which usu. takes a few minutes and is in fact unnecessary. We can add \"-Pskip-webui-build\" to the config doc generation command to save us a few minutes each time.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdd -Pskip-webui-build to the config doc generation command.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented) not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-24T16:15:02Z","updated_at":"2024-05-27T05:32:09Z","closed_at":"2024-01-29T11:27:43Z","merged_at":"2024-01-29T11:27:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"ce67b7d7c380f8639ef2b13ed7b9af34bb032726","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24190/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24190/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24190/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/52fef1b884ea88d2c74e391c1d5ae3ab9179d941","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-34230","ref":"FLINK-34230","sha":"52fef1b884ea88d2c74e391c1d5ae3ab9179d941","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-24T10:54:08Z","updated_at":"2024-02-19T10:34:23Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b4bc56d5049da1d75d95443cc9f2c5cff01b5608","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:flip-403-2","ref":"flip-403-2","sha":"b4bc56d5049da1d75d95443cc9f2c5cff01b5608","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe name `AkkaOptions` is wrong after replacing Akka with Apache Pekko in FLINK-32468. The new options should be named more generically to avoid running into the same issue in the future when/if we decide to replace Pekko with gRPC (FLINK-29281). \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Renames `AkkaOptions` into `RpcOptions` using the IDE\r\n2. Copied `RpcOptions` to `AkkaOptions`, adds `@Deprecated` annotation to `AkkaOptions` and references corresponding `RpcOptions` in `AkkaOptions`.\r\n3. Removes deprecated options from `RpcOptions` (but keeps them in `AkkaOptions`)\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs we transition to new configuration files that adhere to the standard YAML format, users are expected to manually migrate their existing config files. However, this process can be error-prone and time-consuming.\r\n\r\nTo simplify the migration, we're introducing an automated script. This script leverages BashJavaUtils to efficiently convert old flink-conf.yaml files into the new config file config.yaml, thereby reducing the effort required for migration.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nIntroduce a migration script `migrate-config-tool.sh` to transfer legacy config file to new config file.\r\nThis script accepts three input parameters: `FLINK_CONF_DIR`, `FLINK_BIN_DIR`, and `FLINK_LIB_DIR`. The output will be a newly created `config.yaml` file located in the `FLINK_CONF_DIR` directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by FlinkConfigLoaderTest#testMigrateLegacyConfigToStandardYaml and BashJavaUtilsITCase#testMigrateLegacyConfigToStandardYaml\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce unified serialization config option for all Kryo, POJO and customized serializers for parameterized serialization config based on pure config.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Introduce `pipeline.serialization-config`, a unified serialization config option for all Kryo, POJO and customized serializers.\r\n2. For POJO & Kryo serializers, the config is parsed and dispatched to the existing `SerializerConfig#registerPojoType`, `SerializerConfig#registerKryoType`, `SerializerConfig#addDefaultKryoSerializer`, and `SerializerConfig#registerTypeWithKryoSerializer` methods.\r\n3. For customized serializers, the specified type info factories is registered in the global static factory map of `TypeExtractor `for now so that it can be accessed from the static methods of `TypeExtractor` where `SerializerConfig` is currently not accessible. Plan to migrate the static methods to take `SerializerConfig` as one of the arguments in v1.20.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded tests in  `SerializerConfigTest` on parsing different types of serializer config, both legal and illegal.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) yes\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) yes\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented) docs\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-23T16:41:14Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:56:37Z","closed_at":"2024-01-25T02:52:30Z","merged_at":"2024-01-25T02:52:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"806970c4b4712f9bf1e938c53040f19023d37ad2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24182/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24182/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24182/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e478d8f41e390048471c07c698f515c364f05ec9","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-34120","ref":"FLINK-34120","sha":"e478d8f41e390048471c07c698f515c364f05ec9","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nChange the default config file to config.yaml in flink-dist.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Change the default config file to config.yaml in flink-dist.\r\n  - Update the content 'flink-conf.yaml' in the code to use 'config.yaml'\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, include all e2e cases and it cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n- Disabling intermittently failing test due to high frequency of failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added `Disabled` annotation to `AsyncSinkWriterThrottlingTest`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the unstable test case `TableAggregateITCase.testFlagAggregateWithOrWithoutIncrementalUpdate`. \r\nI attempted to reproduce the failure, but I have been unsuccessful in replicating the issue in the local environment. However, upon inspecting the table's maven log, I did identify some common attributes shared by the failed cases. It is worth noting that all the failures occurred when the state backend type was set to `HEAP`. \r\n\r\nI suspect that the issue may have arisen because I performed two checks within a single test case. This is likely problematic because the HEAP uses a shared statebackend directory within the test, whereas RocksDB generates a distinct one each time. Modifying the test should be able to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# heap first run\r\n18:30:10,490 [jobmanager-io-thread-21] INFO  org.apache.flink.runtime.jobmaster.JobMaster                 []

What is the purpose of the change\r\nAs shown in [FLIP-389](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=278465498), this PR has 2 goals:\r\n\r\n- To expose the SplitFetcherManager / SingleThreadFetcheManager as Public, allowing connector developers to easily create their own threading models in the SourceReaderBase.\r\n\r\n- To hide the element queue from the connector developers and make SplitFetcherManager the only owner class of the queue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- By exposing the SplitFetcherManager / SingleThreadFetcheManager, connector developers can easily create their own threading models in the SourceReaderBase, by implementing addSplits(), removeSplits() and maybeShutdownFinishedFetchers() functions.\r\n- Note that the SplitFetcher constructor is package private, so users can only create SplitFetchers via SplitFetcherManager.createSplitFetcher(). This ensures each SplitFetcher is always owned by the SplitFetcherManager.\r\n\r\n-  This FLIP essentially embedded the element queue (a FutureCompletingBlockingQueue) instance into the SplitFetcherManager. This hides the element queue from the connector developers and simplifies the SourceReaderBase to consist of only SplitFetcherManager and RecordEmitter as major components.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as HybridSourceReaderTest and SplitFetcherManagerTest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: ( no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  -  how is the feature

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, if users do not set the `execution.batch.adaptive.auto-parallelism.default-source-parallelism` configuration option, the AdaptiveBatchScheduler defaults to a parallelism of 1 for source vertices. In [FLIP-379](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-379%3A+Dynamic+source+parallelism+inference+for+batch+jobs#FLIP379:Dynamicsourceparallelisminferenceforbatchjobs-IntroduceDynamicParallelismInferenceinterfaceforSource), the value of `execution.batch.adaptive.auto-parallelism.default-source-parallelism` will act as the upper bound for inferring dynamic source parallelism, and continuing with the current policy is no longer appropriate.\r\n\r\nWe plan to change the effectiveness strategy of `execution.batch.adaptive.auto-parallelism.default-source-parallelism`; when the user does not set this config option, we will use the value of `execution.batch.adaptive.auto-parallelism.max-parallelism` as the upper bound for source parallelism inference. If `execution.batch.adaptive.auto-parallelism.max-parallelism` is also not configured, the value of `parallelism.default` will be used as a fallback.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Change the logic for determining the default source parallelism value; when `execution.batch.adaptive.auto-parallelism.default-source-parallelism` is not configured, fall back to the global max parallelism.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added unit test in DefaultVertexParallelismAndInputInfosDeciderTest#testComputeSourceParallelismUpperBound to test  the case where default source parallelism is not configured.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR extends #24031 with traces for the rescaling/restore times from local state.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe GitHub Actions workflow (FLINK-33901) requires us to upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 (or 20.04) (see further details in sub-issue FLINK-33923). The Azure Pipeline's Docker image is currently relying on 16.04. The e2e tests in the Azure Pipeline are actually relying on 20.04.\r\n\r\nThis PR is about aligning all these workflow with what we're planning to use for GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding Dockerfile changes can be reviewed https://github.com/zentol/flink-ci-docker/pull/4.\r\n\r\nWe might want to wait with this change till after 1.19 was released to avoid running into suprises during the release. :thinking: \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Updates Docker container to use `mapohl/flink-ci:FLINK-34914`\r\n* Updates test pool vmImage from 20.04 to 22.04\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request implement minibatch join in e2e.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdded minibatch switch in class StreamExecJoin. And a new class called MiniBatchUtil to control the configuration of minibatch is introduced. Besides, class StreamPhysicalJoin added the information of minibatch.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded a new mode for minibatch in JoinItCase, the existing integration tests verify end-to-end deployment.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-22T02:44:36Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:56:57Z","closed_at":"2024-01-29T06:38:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33f619a39e49c65d54272e4d52800fa3ea081108","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24161/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24161/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24161/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e0a8f270fff1a563b9669329e42795803af0f829","head":{"label":"xishuaidelin:minibatch-pr3","ref":"minibatch-pr3","sha":"e0a8f270fff1a563b9669329e42795803af0f829","user":{"login":"xishuaidelin","id":39591515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTkxNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39591515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin","html_url":"https://github.com/xishuaidelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":629308735,"node_id":"R_kgDOJYJ9Pw","name":"flink","full_name":"xishuaidelin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xishuaidelin","id":39591515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTkxNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39591515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin","html_url":"https://github.com/xishuaidelin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xishuaidelin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xishuaidelin/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove SlotMatchingStrategy related logic\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for IncrementalGroupAggregate node*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for IncrementalGroupAggregate node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-19T17:12:45Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:57:02Z","closed_at":"2024-02-13T11:33:14Z","merged_at":"2024-02-13T11:33:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"5844092408d21023a738077d0922cc75f1e634d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bb90f1142a92ddece68b71180f476d6ad5f01f09","head":{"label":"bvarghese1:incr_group_agg_restore_tests","ref":"incr_group_agg_restore_tests","sha":"bb90f1142a92ddece68b71180f476d6ad5f01f09","user":{"login":"bvarghese1","id":10199670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk5Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10199670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1","html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":639592192,"node_id":"R_kgDOJh9nAA","name":"flink","full_name":"bvarghese1/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bvarghese1","id":10199670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk5Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10199670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1","html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMoving Sink tests to using the new Sink API, and creating new deprecated ones to keep testing the old Sink API.\r\nAlso adding a few specific tests.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Moved the old `TestSinkV2` to the `deprecated` package\r\n- Created a new `TestSinkV2` using the new Sink APIs\r\n- Added a new feature `setWithPreCommitTopology`, so we can add preCommitTopology to the test sink\r\n- Duplicated the tests to use both sinks\r\n- Added a few specific tests for the new API\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis PR is all about test 😄

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, session window agg will rewrite to group window operator in exec node instead of using window operator. This pr is try to support session window tvf in table-runtime.\r\n\r\nNote: This pr is a draft pr. The first and second commit is reviewing in other pr. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *add isAlignedWindow for WindowSpec interface*\r\n  - *introduce basic interface and class for unslicing window*\r\n  - *introduce unslicing window agg for session window tvf*\r\n  - *add operator test for this pr*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. There has been ITCases for session window tvf agg. So no need to add them. They are:\r\n  - WindowAggregateITCase#testEventTimeSessionWindow\r\n  - WindowAggregateITCase#testEventTimeSessionWindowWithCDCSource\r\n  - WindowAggregateITCase#testDistinctAggWithMergeOnEventTimeSessionWindow\r\n  - WindowAggregateTest#testSession_OnRowtime\r\n  - WindowAggregateTest#testSession_OnProctime\r\n  - WindowAggregateTest#testSession_DistinctSplitEnabled\r\n  - WindowAggregateTest#testGroupKeyMoreThanPartitionKeyInSessionWindow\r\n  - WindowAggregateTest#testGroupKeyLessThanPartitionKeyInSessionWindow\r\n  - WindowAggregateJsonITCase#testEventTimeSessionWindow\r\n\r\n3. Some harness tests for operator are added.\r\n  - UnslicingWindowAggOperatorTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a default implementation to SplitEnumeratorContext#setIsProcessingBacklog to fix the compatibility issue introduced in #22931.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adds a default implementation to SplitEnumeratorContext#setIsProcessingBacklog.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIt has been verified that the flink-connector-kafka repo will not throw compatibility exception about this method when building against flink-1.19-snapshot after the changes in this PR are introduced. The build would still fail due to other API-incompatible changes, though, and those changes are not related to #22931.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-19T03:10:21Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:57:09Z","closed_at":"2024-01-19T12:13:32Z","merged_at":"2024-01-19T12:13:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"b309ceb8de005fd65d979ffce928d08606f36e89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a9ab0eaa9f38ddca0f6ba23c450ececb33acc7ee","head":{"label":"yunfengzhou-hub:FLINK-34149","ref":"FLINK-34149","sha":"a9ab0eaa9f38ddca0f6ba23c450ececb33acc7ee","user":{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":360814046,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjA4MTQwNDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"yunfengzhou-hub/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA bit reasoning for the change \r\n\r\n>The reason is that since 1.28.0 ( [CALCITE-4787](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4787) - Move core to use Immutables instead of ImmutableBeans ) Calcite started to use Immutables (https://immutables.github.io/) and since 1.29.0 removed ImmutableBeans ( [CALCITE-4839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4839) - Remove remnants of ImmutableBeans post 1.28 release ). All rule configuration related api which is not Immutables based is marked as deprecated. Since Immutables implies code generation while java compilation it is seems impossible to use for rules in Scala code.\r\n\r\nThe PR migrates `FlinkLimit0RemoveRule` to java \r\nit doesn't touch `FlinkLimit0RemoveRuleTest` to be sure that java version continues passing it\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDrawing on StreamWindowSQLExample, output comments are provided for new developers to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdd should output on WordCountSQLExample\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-18T14:47:22Z","updated_at":"2024-01-18T14:53:35Z","closed_at":"2024-01-18T14:53:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a2791627d09214f2c7565a86a85070b20e19685","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7d4aea58dfaf2444a1c68be1af112bc2d76171ea","head":{"label":"caicancai:show_output","ref":"show_output","sha":"7d4aea58dfaf2444a1c68be1af112bc2d76171ea","user":{"login":"caicancai","id":77189278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTg5Mjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77189278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai","html_url":"https://github.com/caicancai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":738115053,"node_id":"R_kgDOK_697Q","name":"flink","full_name":"caicancai/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"caicancai","id":77189278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTg5Mjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77189278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai","html_url":"https://github.com/caicancai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caicancai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/caicancai/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport source parallelism setting for DataGen connector.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add SOURCE_PARALLELISM into DataGenConnectorOptions and pass it to planner\r\n- Update docs, introducing scan.parallelism\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded UT to verify that the parallelism info is correctly passed to planner.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented) docs\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-18T13:54:29Z","updated_at":"2024-01-27T15:02:16Z","closed_at":"2024-01-26T13:33:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b3ff6724ea82fb3347f414cf1e3e2740fcbdb81","assignee":{"login":"libenchao","id":4471524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzE1MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4471524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao","html_url":"https://github.com/libenchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"libenchao","id":4471524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzE1MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4471524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao","html_url":"https://github.com/libenchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/libenchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/037577603646ba1aae6c8854e7a212f51ce2d983","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-33264","ref":"FLINK-33264","sha":"037577603646ba1aae6c8854e7a212f51ce2d983","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfabric8io k8s client v6.6.2 was updated from v5.12.4 in Flink 1.18.0 (FLINK-31997). This major version upgrade brought a change of behavior in the `LeaderElector`. The old implementation allowed us to reuse the `LeaderElector` instance. The new implementation expects to use one instance per leadership lifecycle (see https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/pull/4125/files).\r\n\r\nSee FLINK-34007 for further details.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Switches from reusing the fabric8io LeaderElector to re-instantiating it\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* ITCase was added to cover the scenario of FLINK-34007. It fails w/o the fix of this PR but succeeds with the fix being included.\r\n\r\nThe test can be verified locally by running `minikube` locally and setting the `ITCASE_KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the kube config of `minikube`. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public
