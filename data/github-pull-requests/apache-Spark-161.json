for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDebugged internally and found a bug where we should disable vectorized reader now based on schema recursively. Currently we check `schema.length` to be no more than `wholeStageMaxNumFields` to enable vectorization. `schema.length` does not take nested columns sub-fields into condition (i.e. view nested column same as primitive column). This check will be wrong when enabling vectorization for nested columns. We should follow [same check](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/WholeStageCodegenExec.scala#L896) from `WholeStageCodegenExec` to check sub-fields recursively. This will not cause correctness issue but will cause performance issue where we may enable vectorization for nested columns by mistake when nested column has a lot of sub-fields.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid OOM/performance regression when reading ORC table with nested column types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in `OrcQuerySuite.scala`. Verified test failed without this change.","created_at":"2021-08-26T03:58:26Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T21:46:13Z","closed_at":"2021-08-26T11:42:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6360c4530f7fe6e5c94a1825ef6188561c40cfaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33842/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33842/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33842/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3c7c7ea94e909c470e21c958edb9d87602b2ebf7","head":{"label":"c21:field-fix","ref":"field-fix","sha":"3c7c7ea94e909c470e21c958edb9d87602b2ebf7","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use the session time zone ( see the SQL config `spark.sql.session.timeZone`) instead of JVM default time zone while converting of special timestamp_ntz strings such as \"today\", \"tomorrow\" and so on.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent implementation is based on the system time zone, and it controverses to other functions/classes that use the session time zone. For example, Spark doesn't respects user's settings:\r\n```sql\r\n$ export TZ=\"Europe/Amsterdam\"\r\n$ ./bin/spark-sql -S\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp_ntz'now';\r\n2021-08-25 18:12:36.233\r\n\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.session.timeZone=America/Los_Angeles;\r\nspark.sql.session.timeZone\tAmerica/Los_Angeles\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp_ntz'now';\r\n2021-08-25 18:14:40.547\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. For the example above, after the changes:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp_ntz'now';\r\n2021-08-25 18:47:46.832\r\n\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.session.timeZone=America/Los_Angeles;\r\nspark.sql.session.timeZone\tAmerica/Los_Angeles\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp_ntz'now';\r\n2021-08-25 09:48:05.211\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DateTimeUtilsSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-08-25T16:48:57Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T02:09:28Z","closed_at":"2021-08-26T02:09:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9abd0b1bbb0b55b0bb2c79402130620062d55a0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33838/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33838/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33838/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f5e3eb44df99030efbaf97b41d6df9140af56a14","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-ts_ntz-special-values","ref":"fix-ts_ntz-special-values","sha":"f5e3eb44df99030efbaf97b41d6df9140af56a14","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admi

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nConsider such cases:\r\n\r\n1. we close a job when it is doing dynamic partition insert, it will remain such staging dir under table's path.  So we make the staging dir customized like hive can avoid remain such staging dir under table path.\r\n2. In hive's API, if we specify a staging dir, not use default staging dir (under table path), it can directly rename to target path and can avoid many hdfs file operations. In spark currently only dynamic partition insert support staging dir, we can do this like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33811\r\n3. We can support add a file commit protocol that support staging dir for all types of insert, then when we use that commit protocol, wen can do:\r\n    - Insert into non-partitioned table form it self\r\n    - Insert into partition table's statistic partition and read data from target partition\r\n    - Insert into different partition using statistic partition together\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake spark data source insert's  stagingDir can be customized and then we can do more optimize base on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can define staging dir by `spark.exec.stagingDir`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-25T03:14:48Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T06:54:35Z","closed_at":"2022-10-01T00:34:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a823f3ab39a5de870890fb9ba24aedf0a237de66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProposing that the `KafkaOffsetRangeCalculator`'s range calculation logic be modified to exclude small (i.e. un-split) partitions from the overall proportional distribution math, in order to more reasonably divide the large partitions when they are accompanied by many small partitions, and to provide optimal behavior for cases where a `minPartitions` value is deliberately computed based on the volume of data being read.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhile the [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-kafka-integration.html) does contain a clear disclaimer,\r\n\r\n> Please note that this configuration is like a hint: the number of Spark tasks will be **approximately** `minPartitions`. It can be less or more depending on rounding errors or Kafka partitions that didn't receive any new data.\r\n\r\nthere are cases where the calculated Kafka partition range splits can differ greatly from expectations. For evenly distributed data and most `minPartitions` values this would not be a major or commonly encountered concern. However when the distribution of data across partitions is very heavily skewed, somewhat surprising range split calculations can result.\r\n\r\nFor example, given the following input data:\r\n\r\n- 1 partition containing 10,000 messages\r\n- 1,000 partitions each containing 1 message\r\n\r\nSpark processing code loading from this collection of 1,001 partitions may decide that it would like each task to read no more than 1,000 messages. Consequently, it could specify a `minPartitions` value of 1,010 — expecting the single large partition to be split into 10 equal chunks, along with the 1,000 small partitions each having their own task. That is far from what actually occurs. The `KafkaOffsetRangeCalculator` algorithm ends up splitting the large partition into 918 chunks of 10 or 11 messages, two orders of magnitude from the desired maximum message count per task and nearly double the number of Spark tasks hinted in the configuration.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests and added new unit tests","created_at":"2021-08-24T21:30:32Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T18:10:01Z","closed_at":"2021-08-29T07:38:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c104611c54072e8f293e9f2ca57298302875dc0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32678. It moves `LocalScan` from SQL core package to Catalyst package.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere are two packages for `org.apache.spark.sql.connector`\r\nSQL Core: https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/sql/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector\r\nCatalyst: https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector\r\n\r\nAs `LocalScan` doesn't depend on the classes of SQL Core, we should move it to catalyst.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the trait is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark SQL includes a data source that can read data from other databases using JDBC.\r\nSpark also supports the case-insensitive option `pushDownPredicate`.\r\nAccording to http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-jdbc.html, If set `pushDownPredicate` to false, no filter will be pushed down to the JDBC data source and thus all filters will be handled by Spark.\r\nBut I find it still be pushed down to JDBC data source.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix bug `pushDownPredicate`=false failed to prevent push down filters to JDBC data source.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nThe output of query will not change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the procedure to run the Oracle Integration Suite is based on building the Oracle RDBMS image from the Dockerfiles provided by Oracle.\r\nRecently, Oracle has started providing database images, see  https://container-registry.oracle.com\r\nMoreover an Oracle employee is maintaining Oracle XE images that are streamlined for testing at https://hub.docker.com/r/gvenzl/oracle-xe and https://github.com/gvenzl/oci-oracle-xe This solves the issue that official images are quite large and make testing resource-intensive and slow.\r\nThis proposes to document the available options and to introduce a default value for ORACLE_DOCKER_IMAGE\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change will make it easier and faster to run the Oracle Integration Suite, removing the need to manually build an Oracle DB image.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested:\r\n```\r\nexport ENABLE_DOCKER_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1\r\n./build/sbt -Pdocker-integration-tests \"testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc.OracleIntegrationSuite\"\r\n./build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor current data source insert commit protocol, it have such problem:\r\n  case a: both job a and job b write data into partitioned table a with different statistic partition, it will have conflict since they use same tmp location `${table_location}/_temporary/0/....`, when job a finish it will clean this location, may cause clear job b's data.\r\n  case b: for current dynamic partition insert, if we kill a job is writing data, will remain data under table location.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor current non dynamic partition insert in v1, it have step:\r\n    1.  Task attempts firstly write files under the  intermediate path, e.g. `/path/to/outputPath/_temporary/{appAttemptId}/_temporary/{taskAttemptId}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet`.\r\n    2. Then task commit file to  `/path/to/outputPath/_temporary/{appId}/_temporary/{taskId}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet`.\r\n    3. Job commit move file to `/path/to/outputPath/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet`.\r\n\r\nFor current dynamic partition insert in v1, it have step:\r\n    1.  Task attempts firstly write files under the  intermediate path, e.g.` /path/to/outputPath/.spark-staging-{jobId}/_temporary/{appAttemptId}/_temporary/{taskAttemptId}/a=1/b=1/xxx.parquet`.\r\n    2. Then task commit file to  `/path/to/outputPath/.spark-staging-{jobId}/_temporary/{appId}/_temporary/{taskId}/a=1/b=1/xxx.parquet`.\r\n    3. Job commit move file to `/path/to/outputPath/a=1/b=1/xxx.parquet`.\r\n\r\nIn this pr's  `SQLPathHadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol `, for all type of insert:\r\n  1.  Task attempts firstly write files under the  intermediate path, e.g. `{staging_dir}/_temporary/{appAttemptId}/_temporary/{taskAttemptId}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet`.\r\n  2. Then task commit file to  `{staging_dir}/_temporary/{appId}/_temporary/{taskId}/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet`.\r\n  3. Job commit move file to `/path/to/outputPath/{part_spec_path}/xxx.parquet`.\r\n\r\nBenefit:\r\n   1. We may don't need to logic in HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol to handle file for dynamic partition insert\r\n   2. Can support concurrent insert into partitioned table with statistic partition\r\n   3. If we use staging dir not under target path, we can we many optimize about file operation such as just mv folder or just rename folder.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvide a more flexible commit protocol and won't impact perf\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can set sql commit protocol to `SQLPathHadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol` to use a commit protocol with staging dir\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-24T08:22:36Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T00:12:12Z","closed_at":"2022-01-25T00:12:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58ec3704885c93b0e4fcc2a382444f7307544517","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c2f606f0a6a3816f5d46ade0466912be0dfb4996","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-36562","ref":"SPARK-36562","sha":"c2f606f0a6a3816f5d46ade0466912be0dfb4996","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that executors are never re-scheduled if the worker which the executors run on stops.\r\nAs a result, the application stucks.\r\nYou can easily reproduce this issue by the following procedures.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Run master\r\n$ sbin/start-master.sh\r\n\r\n# Run worker 1\r\n$ SPARK_LOG_DIR=/tmp/worker1 SPARK_PID_DIR=/tmp/worker1/ sbin/start-worker.sh -c 1 -h localhost -d /tmp/worker1 --webui-port 8081 spark://<hostname>:7077\r\n\r\n# Run worker 2\r\n$ SPARK_LOG_DIR=/tmp/worker2 SPARK_PID_DIR=/tmp/worker2/ sbin/start-worker.sh -c 1 -h localhost -d /tmp/worker2 --webui-port 8082 spark://<hostname>:7077\r\n\r\n# Run Spark Shell\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --master spark://<hostname>:7077 --executor-cores 1 --total-executor-cores 1\r\n\r\n# Check which worker the executor runs on and then kill the worker.\r\n$ kill <worker pid>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the procedure above, we will expect that the executor is re-scheduled on the other worker but it won't.\r\n\r\nThe reason seems that `Master.schedule` cannot be called after the worker is marked as `WorkerState.DEAD`.\r\nSo, the solution this PR proposes is to call `Master.schedule` whenever `Master.removeWorker` is called.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes an issue that `ExecutorRunner` can send `ExecutorStateChanged` message without changing its state.\r\nThis issue causes assertion error.\r\n```\r\n2021-08-13 14:05:37,991 [dispatcher-event-loop-9] ERROR: Ignoring errorjava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: executor 0 state transfer from RUNNING to RUNNING is illegal\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a critical bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually tested with the procedure shown above and confirmed the executor is re-scheduled.","created_at":"2021-08-24T06:18:30Z","updated_at":"2021-08-28T09:05:26Z","closed_at":"2021-08-28T09:02:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4c3ad1f8edb3ba4b0972efd3d97d66c9eb15bc8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33818/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33818/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33818/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/256b285be566193376ee1dddeef25e135b089758","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-scheduling-stuck","ref":"fix-scheduling-stuck","sha":"256b285be566193376ee1dddeef25e135b089758","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new correctness rule `SpecialDatetimeValues` to the final analysis phase. It replaces casts of strings to date/timestamp_ltz/timestamp_ntz by literals of such types if the strings contain special datetime values like `today`, `yesterday` and `tomorrow`, and the input strings are foldable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To avoid a breaking change.\r\n2. To improve user experience with Spark SQL. After the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32714, users have to use typed literals instead of implicit casts. For instance,\r\nat Spark 3.1:\r\n```sql\r\nselect ts_col > 'now';\r\n```\r\nbut the query fails at the moment, and users have to use typed timestamp literal:\r\n```sql\r\nselect ts_col > timestamp'now';\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Previous release 3.1 has supported the feature already till it was removed by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32714.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd `aggregate` package under `sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/expressions` and move all the aggregates (e.g. `Count`, `Max`, `Min`, etc.) there.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRight now these aggregates are under `sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/expressions`. It looks OK now, but we plan to add a new `filter` package under `expressions` for all the DSV2 filters. It will look strange that filters have their own package, but aggregates don't.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that field names of structs generated by arrays_zip function could be unexpectedly re-written by analyzer/optimizer.\r\nHere is an example.\r\n```\r\nval df = sc.parallelize(Seq((Array(1, 2), Array(3, 4)))).toDF(\"a1\", \"b1\").selectExpr(\"arrays_zip(a1, b1) as zipped\")\r\ndf.printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- zipped: array

b1: integer (nullable = true)                                      // OK. b1 is expected name\r\n\r\ndf.explain\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [arrays_zip(_1#3, _2#4) AS zipped#12]

\r\n\r\nI investigated functions which can be affected this issue but I found only arrays_zip so far.\r\nTo fix this issue, this PR changes the definition of ArraysZip to retain field names to avoid being re-written by analyzer/optimizer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is apparently a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo. After this change, the field names are no longer re-written but it should be expected behavior for users.\r\n\r\n#### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.","created_at":"2021-08-23T09:45:37Z","updated_at":"2021-08-24T17:05:08Z","closed_at":"2021-08-24T15:33:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9d98aff590fcdb9a8a89183a2fc486cad2b2f23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33810/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33810/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33810/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8933e2e22693b16f1e7c023bd11461d3fe17c7e7","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-35876-3.1","ref":"SPARK-35876-3.1","sha":"8933e2e22693b16f1e7c023bd11461d3fe17c7e7","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move distributed-sequence index implementation to SQL plan to leverage optimizations such as column

leverage optimization of SQL engine and avoid unnecessary shuffle to create default index.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added. Also, this PR will test all unittests in pandas API on Spark after switching the default index implementation to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs Jacek Laskowski pointed out in the dev list, there is StackOverflowError if compiling Spark with the current MAVEN_OPTS in Spark documentation.\r\nWe should update it with `-Xss64m` to avoid it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManual test. The MAVEN_OPTS is consistent with our github action

DB Tsai d_tsai@apple.com\r\nCo-Authored-By: Huaxin Gao huaxin_gao@apple.com\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd DSV2 Filters and use these in V2 codepath.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe motivation of adding DSV2 filters:\r\n1. The values in V1 filters are Scala types. When translating catalyst `Expression` to V1 filers, we have to call `convertToScala` to convert from Catalyst types used internally in rows to standard Scala types, and later convert Scala types back to Catalyst types. This is very inefficient. In V2 filters, we use `Expression`  for filter values, so the conversion from  Catalyst types to Scala types and Scala types back to Catalyst types are avoided.\r\n2. Improve nested column filter support.\r\n3. Make the filters work better with the rest of the DSV2 APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The new V2 filters\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnew test\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-22T16:40:10Z","updated_at":"2021-09-13T05:15:40Z","closed_at":"2021-09-11T17:12:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3724e75d2303d85a51bedcc9d5f3a2743f8ef133","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33803/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33803/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33803/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d30b1a128f100d65418a7260267c6dbe844e8817","head":{"label":"huaxingao:filter","ref":"filter","sha":"d30b1a128f100d65418a7260267c6dbe844e8817","user":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50813048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgxMzA0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"huaxingao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the new ParamRandomBuilder, choose each grid point's values randomly each time, rather than choosing the _grid_ randomly and performing grid search.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is probably what callers actually expect it to do, and is more effective than a grid search (whose coordinates happen to be random)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIf merged for 3.2.0:\r\nNo, this is new functionality in 3.2.0 anyway\r\nIf after:\r\nYes, but, the API is the same, the results still match the 'contract', and this is if anything a behavior improvement.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting and new test cases.","created_at":"2021-08-20T22:11:31Z","updated_at":"2021-09-10T12:53:25Z","closed_at":"2021-08-24T17:33:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ada0a4b1c939f73d4ef3edf8056fbe87bb33c47b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/64cc2abe15b6a622976ecc05324ef02622ea61fa","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-34415.2","ref":"SPARK-34415.2","sha":"64cc2abe15b6a622976ecc05324ef02622ea61fa","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInstead of exiting the executor within the RpcEnv's thread, exit the executor in a separate thread.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current exit way in `onDisconnected` can cause the deadlock, which has the exact same root cause with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12012:\r\n\r\n* `onDisconnected` -> `System.exit` are called in sequence in the thread of `MessageLoop.threadpool`\r\n* `System.exit` triggers shutdown hooks and `executor.stop` is one of the hooks.\r\n* `executor.stop` stops the `Dispatcher`, which waits for the `MessageLoop.threadpool`  to shutdown further.\r\n* Thus, the thread which runs `System.exit` waits for hooks to be done, but the `MessageLoop.threadpool` in the hook waits that thread to finish. Finally, this mutual dependence results in the deadlock.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the executor shutdown won't hang.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass existing tests.\r\n\r\nCloses #33759 from Ngone51/fix-executor-shutdown-hang.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: yi.wu <yi.wu@databricks.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan <wenchen@databricks.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn Stage related restful API, we support `taskStatus` parameter as a list\r\n```\r\n @QueryParam(\"taskStatus\") taskStatus: JList[TaskStatus]\r\n```\r\nIn restful we should write like \r\n```\r\ntaskStatus=SUCCESS&taskStatus=FAILED\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's usefule but not show in the doc, and many user don't know how to write the list parameters.\r\nSo add this feature to monitoring doc too.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake doc clear\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis patch proposes a fix to prevent triggering BlockManager reregistration while `StopExecutor` msg is in-flight.\r\nHere on receiving `StopExecutor` msg, we do not remove the corresponding `BlockManagerInfo` from `blockManagerInfo` map, instead we mark it as dead by updating the corresponding `executorRemovalTs`. There's a separate cleanup thread running to periodically remove the stale `BlockManagerInfo` from `blockManangerInfo` map.\r\n\r\nNow if a recently removed `BlockManager` tries to register, the driver simply ignores it since the `blockManagerInfo` map already contains an entry for it. The same applies to `BlockManagerHeartbeat`, if the BlockManager belongs to a recently removed executor, the `blockManagerInfo` map would contain an entry and we shall not ask the corresponding `BlockManager` to re-register.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis changes are needed since BlockManager reregistration while executor is shutting down causes inconsistent bookkeeping of executors in Spark.\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n- `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` issues async `StopExecutor` on executorEndpoint\r\n- `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` removes that executor from Driver's internal data structures and publishes `SparkListenerExecutorRemoved` on the `listenerBus`.\r\n- Executor has still not processed `StopExecutor` from the Driver\r\n- Driver receives heartbeat from the Executor, since it cannot find the `executorId` in its data structures, it responds with `HeartbeatResponse(reregisterBlockManager = true)`\r\n- `BlockManager` on the Executor reregisters with the `BlockManagerMaster` and `SparkListenerBlockManagerAdded` is published on the `listenerBus`\r\n- Executor starts processing the `StopExecutor` and exits\r\n- `AppStatusListener` picks the `SparkListenerBlockManagerAdded` event and updates `AppStatusStore`\r\n- `statusTracker.getExecutorInfos` refers `AppStatusStore` to get the list of executors which returns the dead executor as alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Modified the existing unittests.\r\n- Ran a simple test application on minikube that asserts on number of executors are zero once the executor idle timeout is reached.","created_at":"2021-08-19T02:24:46Z","updated_at":"2021-08-21T00:31:56Z","closed_at":"2021-08-20T06:43:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a672051ad924fb92010d078762bf3817b0e1967","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33782/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33782/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33782/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/24e9ce1f00553ea1eeb0d11bdbafbf5f5c244064","head":{"label":"sumeetgajjar:SPARK-35011-br-3.0","ref":"SPARK-35011-br-3.0","sha":"24e9ce1f00553ea1eeb0d11bdbafbf5f5c244064","user":{"login":"sumeetgajjar","id":7351922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTE5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7351922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar","html_url":"https://github.com/sumeetgajjar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":354211726,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTQyMTE3MjY=","name":"spark","full_name":"sumeetgajjar/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sumeetgajjar","id":7351922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTE5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7351922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar","html_url":"https://github.com/sumeetgajjar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumeetgajjar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sumeetgajjar/spark","description":"Apache

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30648\r\n\r\nANALYZE TABLE and TABLES are essentially the same command, it's weird to put them in 2 different doc pages. This PR proposes to merge them into one doc page.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nsimplify the doc\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis patch proposes a fix to prevent triggering BlockManager reregistration while `StopExecutor` msg is in-flight.\r\nHere on receiving `StopExecutor` msg, we do not remove the corresponding `BlockManagerInfo` from `blockManagerInfo` map, instead we mark it as dead by updating the corresponding `executorRemovalTs`. There's a separate cleanup thread running to periodically remove the stale `BlockManagerInfo` from `blockManangerInfo` map.\r\n\r\nNow if a recently removed `BlockManager` tries to register, the driver simply ignores it since the `blockManagerInfo` map already contains an entry for it. The same applies to `BlockManagerHeartbeat`, if the BlockManager belongs to a recently removed executor, the `blockManagerInfo` map would contain an entry and we shall not ask the corresponding `BlockManager` to re-register.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis changes are needed since BlockManager reregistration while executor is shutting down causes inconsistent bookkeeping of executors in Spark.\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\n- `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` issues async `StopExecutor` on executorEndpoint\r\n- `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` removes that executor from Driver's internal data structures and publishes `SparkListenerExecutorRemoved` on the `listenerBus`.\r\n- Executor has still not processed `StopExecutor` from the Driver\r\n- Driver receives heartbeat from the Executor, since it cannot find the `executorId` in its data structures, it responds with `HeartbeatResponse(reregisterBlockManager = true)`\r\n- `BlockManager` on the Executor reregisters with the `BlockManagerMaster` and `SparkListenerBlockManagerAdded` is published on the `listenerBus`\r\n- Executor starts processing the `StopExecutor` and exits\r\n- `AppStatusListener` picks the `SparkListenerBlockManagerAdded` event and updates `AppStatusStore`\r\n- `statusTracker.getExecutorInfos` refers `AppStatusStore` to get the list of executors which returns the dead executor as alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Modified the existing unittests.\r\n- Ran a simple test application on minikube that asserts on number of executors are zero once the executor idle timeout is

PR backports #32043 to branch-3.0\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR prevents reregistering BlockManager when a Executor is shutting down. It is achieved by checking  `executorShutdown` before calling `env.blockManager.reregister()`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change is required since Spark reports executors as active, even they are removed.\r\nI was testing Dynamic Allocation on K8s with about 300 executors. While doing so, when the executors were torn down due to `spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout`, I noticed all the executor pods being removed from K8s, however, under the \"Executors\" tab in SparkUI, I could see some executors listed as alive.  [spark.sparkContext.statusTracker.getExecutorInfos.length](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/65da9287bc5112564836a555cd2967fc6b05856f/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/SparkStatusTracker.scala#L105) also returned a value greater than 1. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a new test.\r\n\r\n## Logs\r\nFollowing are the logs of the executor(Id:303) which re-registers

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to split the `dateFormat` and `timestampFormat` options in CSV/JSON datasources to:\r\n- In write (`dateFormatInWrite`/`timestampFormatInWrite`). CSV/JSON datasource will use it in formatting of dates/timestamps. If an user doesn't initialise it, it will be set to a default value.\r\n- In read (`dateFormatInRead`/`timestampFormatInRead`). The datasources will use it while parsing of input dates/timestamps strings. If an user doesn't set it, we will keep it as uninitialized (None), and use CAST to parse the input dates/timestamps strings.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis should improve user experience with Spark SQL, and make the default parsing behavior more flexible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nPotentially, it can.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites, and by new tests that are added to `JsonSuite` and to `CSVSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *CSVLegacyTimeParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *JsonFunctionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *CSVv1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of #33687.\r\n\r\nUse `LooseVersion` instead of `pkg_resources.parse_version`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the previous PR, `pkg_resources.parse_version` was used, but we should use `LooseVersion` instead to be consistent in the code base.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRefine the SQL reference doc:\r\n- remove useless subitems in the sidebar\r\n- remove useless sub-menu-pages (e.g. `sql-ref-syntax-aux.md`)\r\n- avoid using `#####` in `sql-ref-literals.md`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe subitems in the sidebar are quite useless, as the menu page serves the same functionalities:\r\n<img width=\"1040\" alt=\"WX20210817-235840@2x\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3182036/129765924-d7e69bc1-e351-4581-a6de-f2468022f372.png\">\r\nIt's also extra work to keep the manu page and sidebar subitems in sync (The ANSI compliance page is already out of sync).\r\n\r\nThe sub-menu-pages are only referenced by the sidebar, and duplicates the content of the menu page. As a result, the `sql-ref-syntax-aux.md` is already outdated compared to the menu page. It's easier to just look at the menu page.\r\n\r\nThe `#####` is not rendered properly:\r\n<img width=\"776\" alt=\"WX20210818-000119@2x\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3182036/129766760-6f385443-e597-44aa-888d-14d128d45f84.png\">\r\nIt's better to avoid using it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nN/A","created_at":"2021-08-17T16:44:57Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T19:47:25Z","closed_at":"2021-08-17T19:46:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97c0740b16a540ea837a9edba148085f5ef7284e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33767/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33767/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33767/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d621f879a1300eaffb8e98e13aed33379ca4e3d1","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:doc","ref":"doc","sha":"d621f879a1300eaffb8e98e13aed33379ca4e3d1","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark should check result plan's output schema name\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn current code, some optimizer rule may change plan's output schema, since in the code we always use semantic equal to check output, but it may change the plan's output schema.\r\nFor example, for SchemaPruning, if we have a plan\r\n```\r\nProject[a, B]\r\n|--Scan[A, b, c]\r\n```\r\nthe origin output schema is `a, B`, after SchemaPruning. it become\r\n```\r\nProject[A, b]\r\n|--Scan[A, b]\r\n```\r\nIt change the plan's schema. when we use CTAS, the schema is same as query plan's output.\r\nThen since we change the schema, it not consistent with origin SQL. So we need to check final result plan's schema with origin plan's schema\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisted UT\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-17T15:01:54Z","updated_at":"2021-08-26T14:09:29Z","closed_at":"2021-08-26T14:09:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4dc5f9fb23ecdcfadb4fab86f82719a8f6e21825","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33764/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33764/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33764/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cf782d7db5f23515feb6f9d94a237a4e16b47f5e","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-36352-3.0","ref":"SPARK-36352-3.0","sha":"cf782d7db5f23515feb6f9d94a237a4e16b47f5e","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change creates a new type of Trigger: Trigger.AvailableNow for streaming queries. It is like Trigger.Once, which process all available data then stop the query, but with better scalability since data can be processed in multiple batches instead of one.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, this change proposes a new interface `SupportsTriggerAvailableNow`, which is an extension of `SupportsAdmissionControl`. It has one method, `prepareForTriggerAvailableNow`, which will be called at the beginning of streaming queries with Trigger.AvailableNow, to let the source record the offset for the current latest data at the time (a.k.a. the target offset for the query). The source should then behave as if there is no new data coming in after the beginning of the query, i.e., the source will not return an offset higher than the target offset when `latestOffset` is called.\r\n\r\nThis change also updates `FileStreamSource` to be an implementation of `SupportsTriggerAvailableNow`.\r\n\r\nFor other sources that does not implement `SupportsTriggerAvailableNow`, this change also provides a new class `FakeLatestOffsetSupportsTriggerAvailableNow`, which wraps the sources and makes them support Trigger.AvailableNow, by overriding their `latestOffset` method to always return the latest offset at the beginning of the query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently streaming queries with Trigger.Once will always load all of the available data in a single batch. Because of this, the amount of data a query can process is limited, or Spark driver will run out of memory. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUsers will be able to use Trigger.AvailableNow (to process all available data then stop the streaming query) with this change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2021-08-17T12:51:07Z","updated_at":"2021-11-14T21:53:56Z","closed_at":"2021-09-01T06:02:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1bf5a7ab241198d0a3b7d43d19aabbee4ab70c8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33608 to branch-3.1\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fail properly so JSON parser can proceed and parse the input with the permissive mode.\r\nPreviously, we passed `null`s as are, the root `InternalRow`s became `null`s, and it causes the query fails even with permissive mode on.\r\nNow, we fail explicitly if `null` is passed when the input array contains `null`.\r\n\r\nNote that this is consistent with non-array JSON input:\r\n\r\n**Permissive mode:**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.json(Seq(\"\"\"{\"a\": \"str\"}\"\"\", \"\"\"null\"\"\").toDS).collect()\r\n```\r\n```\r\nres0: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([str], [null])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Failfast mode**:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"mode\", \"failfast\").json(Seq(\"\"\"{\"a\": \"str\"}\"\"\", \"\"\"null\"\"\").toDS).collect()\r\n```\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Malformed records are detected in record parsing. Parse Mode: FAILFAST. To process malformed records as null result, try setting the option 'mode' as 'PERMISSIVE'.\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.FailureSafeParser.parse(FailureSafeParser.scala:70)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.$anonfun$json$7(DataFrameReader.scala:540)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$11.nextCur(Iterator.scala:484)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the permissive mode to proceed and parse without throwing an exception.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n**Permissive mode:**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.json(Seq(\"\"\"[{\"a\": \"str\"}, null]\"\"\").toDS).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage1.processNext(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.BufferedRowIterator.hasNext(BufferedRowIterator.java:43)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec$$anon$1.hasNext(WholeStageCodegenExec.scala:759)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nres0: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([null])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE that this behaviour is consistent when JSON object is malformed:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a int\").json(Seq(\"\"\"[{\"a\": 123}, {123123}, {\"a\": 123}]\"\"\").toDS).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nres0: Array[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] = Array([null])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we're parsing _one_ JSON array, related records all fail together.\r\n\r\n**Failfast mode:**\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"mode\", \"failfast\").json(Seq(\"\"\"[{\"a\": \"str\"}, null]\"\"\").toDS).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage1.processNext(Unknown Source)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.BufferedRowIterator.hasNext(BufferedRowIterator.java:43)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec$$anon$1.hasNext(WholeStageCodegenExec.scala:759)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Malformed records are detected in record parsing.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nInstead of exiting the executor within the RpcEnv's thread, exit the executor in a separate thread.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current exit way in `onDisconnected` can cause the deadlock, which has the exact same root cause with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12012:\r\n\r\n* `onDisconnected` -> `System.exit` are called in sequence in the thread of `MessageLoop.threadpool`\r\n* `System.exit` triggers shutdown hooks and `executor.stop` is one of the hooks.\r\n* `executor.stop` stops the `Dispatcher`, which waits for the `MessageLoop.threadpool`  to shutdown further.\r\n* Thus, the thread which runs `System.exit` waits for hooks to be done, but the `MessageLoop.threadpool` in the hook waits that thread to finish. Finally, this mutual dependence results in the deadlock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the executor shutdown won't hang.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-17T06:48:22Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T06:18:01Z","closed_at":"2021-08-18T14:47:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa24a7496a5c857abbd2765e9512cca12b8c395f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33759/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33759/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33759/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/57dc0ca8672f8e981f770752e89f705d8d567e6a","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-executor-shutdown-hang","ref":"fix-executor-shutdown-hang","sha":"57dc0ca8672f8e981f770752e89f705d8d567e6a","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRevert [[SPARK-35028][SQL] ANSI mode: disallow group by aliases ](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32129)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt turns out that many users are using the group by alias feature.  Spark has its precedence rule when alias names conflict with column names in Group by clause: always use the table column. This should be reasonable and acceptable.\r\nAlso, external DBMS such as PostgreSQL and MySQL allow grouping by alias, too. \r\n\r\nAs we are going to announce ANSI mode GA in Spark 3.2, I suggest allowing the group by alias in ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the feature is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the behavior of `astype` for `CategoricalDtype` to follow pandas 1.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n```python\r\n>>> pcat\r\n0    a\r\n1    b\r\n2    c\r\ndtype: category\r\nCategories (3, object): ['a', 'b', 'c']\r\n\r\n>>> pcat.astype(CategoricalDtype([\"b\", \"c\", \"a\"]))\r\n0    a\r\n1    b\r\n2    c\r\ndtype: category\r\nCategories (3, object): ['b', 'c', 'a']\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n```python\r\n>>> pcat\r\n0    a\r\n1    b\r\n2    c\r\ndtype: category\r\nCategories (3, object): ['a', 'b', 'c']\r\n\r\n>>> pcat.astype(CategoricalDtype([\"b\", \"c\", \"a\"]))\r\n0    a\r\n1    b\r\n2    c\r\ndtype: category\r\nCategories (3, object): ['a', 'b', 'c']  # CategoricalDtype is not updated if dtype is the same\r\n```\r\n\r\n`CategoricalDtype` is treated as a same `dtype` if the unique values are the same.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> pcat1 = pser.astype(CategoricalDtype([\"b\", \"c\", \"a\"]))\r\n>>> pcat2 = pser.astype(CategoricalDtype([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]))\r\n>>> pcat1.dtype == pcat2.dtype\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe should follow the latest pandas as much as possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the behavior is changed as example in the PR description.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest","created_at":"2021-08-17T04:13:08Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T01:04:32Z","closed_at":"2021-08-18T18:39:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a234f30314147d460200eb7567782858c0721fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/18679bbbab876a98e4578cc12db68e0d0001fb7a","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-36368","ref":"SPARK-36368","sha":"18679bbbab876a98e4578cc12db68e0d0001fb7a","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7fb8ea319e4931f7721ac6f9c12100c95d252cd2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement `CategoricalIndex.map` and `DatetimeIndex.map`\r\n\r\n`MultiIndex.map` cannot be implemented in the same way as the `map` of other

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIndexes are database objects created on one or more columns of a table. Indexes are used to improve query performance. A detailed explanation of database index is here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index\r\n\r\n This PR adds `supportsIndex` interface that provides APIs to work with indexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMany data sources support index to improvement query performance. In order to take advantage of the index support in data source, this `supportsIndex` interface is added to let user to create/drop an index, list indexes, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes, the following new APIs are added:\r\n\r\n- createIndex\r\n- dropIndex\r\n- indexExists\r\n- listIndexes\r\n\r\nNew SQL syntax:\r\n```\r\n\r\nCREATE [index_type] INDEX [index_name] ON [TABLE] table_name (column_index_property_list)[OPTIONS indexPropertyList]\r\n\r\n    column_index_property_list: column_name [OPTIONS(indexPropertyList)]  [ ,  . . . ]\r\n    indexPropertyList: index_property_name = index_property_value [ ,  . . . ]\r\n\r\nDROP INDEX index_name\r\n\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nonly interface is added for now. Tests will be added when doing the implementation\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-16T18:07:57Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T08:54:57Z","closed_at":"2021-09-29T02:49:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"460fef19c2d6f9a110436602015f6db2fd23fccb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33754/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33754/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33754/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f6ca2e83e89a9b23819fdafae69b93a708303e46","head":{"label":"huaxingao:index_interface","ref":"index_interface","sha":"f6ca2e83e89a9b23819fdafae69b93a708303e46","user":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50813048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgxMzA0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"huaxingao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd new type `AnsiIntervalType` to `AbstractDataType.scala`, and extend it by `YearMonthIntervalType` and by `DayTimeIntervalType`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance. The change will allow to replace checking of both `YearMonthIntervalType` and `DayTimeIntervalType` by a check of `AnsiIntervalType`, for instance:\r\n```scala\r\n    case _: YearMonthIntervalType | _: DayTimeIntervalType => false\r\n``` \r\nby\r\n```scala\r\n    case _: AnsiIntervalType => false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites.","created_at":"2021-08-16T16:19:52Z","updated_at":"2021-08-17T13:17:09Z","closed_at":"2021-08-17T09:28:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85d4dd3d427ba31840f15fa5c4034d58e948aa3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33753/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33753/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33753/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4273ac01b44b66b627b29dce7b073cc064e4fefc","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:ansi-interval-type-trait","ref":"ansi-interval-type-trait","sha":"4273ac01b44b66b627b29dce7b073cc064e4fefc","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently when casting invalid string to year-month interval, Spark always throws an exception, with/without ANSI mode enabled. \r\nThis should only happen when ANSI mode is on. When ANSI mode is off, Spark should return null for invalid cast.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake it consistent with the other data type cast.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the new interval type is not released yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRocksDB provides backward compatibility but it doesn't always provide forward compatibility. It's better to store the RocksDB format version in the checkpoint so that it would give us more information to provide the rollback guarantee when we upgrade the RocksDB version that may introduce incompatible change in a new Spark version.\r\n\r\nA typical case is when a user upgrades their query to a new Spark version, and this new Spark version has a new RocksDB version which may use a new format. But the user hits some bug and decide to rollback. But in the old Spark version, the old RocksDB version cannot read the new format.\r\n\r\nIn order to handle this case, we will write the RocksDB format version to the checkpoint. When restarting from a checkpoint, we will force RocksDB to use the format version stored in the checkpoint. This will ensure the user can rollback their Spark version if needed.\r\n\r\nWe also provide a config `spark.sql.streaming.stateStore.rocksdb.formatVersion` for users who don't need to rollback their Spark versions to overwrite the format version specified in the checkpoint.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nProvide the Spark version rollback guarantee for streaming queries when a new RocksDB introduces an incompatible format change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. RocksDB state store is a new feature in Spark 3.2, which has not yet released.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new unit tests.","created_at":"2021-08-16T07:33:30Z","updated_at":"2021-08-19T07:23:52Z","closed_at":"2021-08-19T07:23:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7d66d857f0fe2fa2677c6bfe780adecaf5578ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main purpose of this pr is to introduce the File Meta Cache mechanism for Spark SQL and the basic File Meta Cache implementation for Orc is provided at the same time. There was originally a [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30483) that supports file meta cache both Parquet and ORC, but `Parquet` has non Deprecated API that can be used to pass footer to create new `ParquetFileReader` and both Apache Spark and Parquet community are reluctant to advertise the deprecated API, so this pr spin off ORC-only part.\r\n\r\nThe main change of this pr as follows:\r\n\r\n- Defined a `FileMetaCacheManager` to cache the mapping `FileMetaKey` to `FileMeta`. The `FileMetaKey` is the cache key, `equals` is determined by the file path by default. The `FileMeta` used to represent the cache value and It is generated by the  `FileMetaKey#getFileMeta `  method. \r\n\r\n- Currently, the `FileMetaCacheManager` supports a simple cache expiration elimination mechanism, the expiration time is determined by the new config  `FILE_META_CACHE_TTL_SINCE_LAST_ACCESS ` and the maximum number of file meta entries the meta cache contains for each executor is determined by the new config `FILE_META_CACHE_MAXIMUM_SIZE`\r\n\r\n- For Orc file format, this pr added `OrcFileMetaKey ` and `OrcFileMeta` to cache Orc file Tail and and the Tail cache can be used by Vectorized read scene both in DS API V1 and V2, the feature will be enabled when `FILE_META_CACHE_ENABLED_SOURCE_LIST ` configured `orc`\r\n\r\nCurrently, the file meta cache mechanism cannot be used by `RowBasedReader`, and it needs the completion of [ORC-746](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ORC-746) for further support.\r\n\r\nThe fileMetaCache need users to pay special attention to the following situations:\r\n\r\n**If the fileMetaCache is enabled, the existing data files should not be replaced with the same file name, otherwise there will be a risk of job failure or wrong data reading before the cache entry expires.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport Orc datasource use File Meta Cache mechanism to reduce the times of metadata reads multiple queries are performed on the same dataset. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd 3 new config:\r\n\r\n- `FILE_META_CACHE_ENABLED_SOURCE_LIST(spark.sql.fileMetaCache.enabledSourceList)`:  A comma-separated list of data source short names for which data source enabled file meta cache, now the file meta cache only support ORC, it is recommended to enabled this config when multiple queries are performed on the same dataset, default is false.\r\n\r\n- `FILE_META_CACHE_TTL_SINCE_LAST_ACCESS(spark.sql.fileMetaCache.ttlSinceLastAccess)` to represent Time-to-live for file metadata cache entry after last access, the unit is seconds.\r\n\r\n-
