Dofn's are very limited due to limited support for serialization in Js as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe main reason someone will want to use the Typescript over a different SDK will often be for its existing modules, not just for the syntax, with the current serialization modules are basically not supported.\r\n\r\nThe following PR gets around serialization entirely by, importing the users function from their code, which allows for basically any code to run.\r\n\r\nThere's a few ways to implement it, none of them seem to be perfect, but ive done two here: \r\n\r\n1. import the function by using require on the user's module\r\n2. having the user register the `fn` and save it in the `global` object\r\n\r\nThe drawbacks:\r\n\r\n1. it's not always possible to determine when the users `fn` can be imported from automatically\r\n2. it's not as clean, we need to require() the users module to get those registers to run\r\n\r\nBoth approaches will result in the users pipeline code to run on the worker, which means we need to avoid starting the pipeline in case we run on the worker (similar to python's \\_\\_name__ == \"\\_\\_main__\"), but we can prob detect it in the sdk code so the user does not have to deal with it.\r\n\r\nThe reason this was so easy to implement is because we already pack in then install the user's code on the workers, so the only thing we need to solve is how to import the fn that that user passed in while creating the pipeline.\r\n\r\nIn any case this PR is meant to showcase the idea and start a conversation\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you

the spotless things were only configured for Java projects. But spotless is actually a generic idempotent formatter for any context. This separates the java configuration into our java modules but applies the formatter to gradle files throughout the repo. It is very slightly finicky about groovy parsing, but we should generally write in a restricted subset of Groovy when necessary and migrate to Kotlin whenever possible.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This plugin is now built to Java 11 class file format. It requires Gradle to run on Java 11 or later. (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/1c1955efc33a80498d5c8f31937bd8f6a090a5a9\">1c1955e</a>)\nb. Enable Java Tool Chain support by default (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/c94b8865d844064f4900d156192c0ea448277854\">c94b886</a>). To disable it, set <code>useJavaToolchains = false</code> in the <code>spotbugs</code> extension.\nc. Drop support for Gradle 7.0 (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/4b0f8006fdfe6345a74edb356e3c3b1da13225f1\">4b0f800</a>). The convention API provides replacement from 7.1 and later, so we use 7.1 as minimal required version.\nd. Remove deprecated methods <code>SpotBugsTask.getEnabledReports()</code> and <code>SpotBugsTask.getFirstEnabledReport</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-gradle-plugin/commit/2ab3c45bf6215ba1f35e87427893d4c97a7190bc\">2ab3c45</a>)\ne. The <code>effort</code> and <code>reportLevel</code> properties of <code>SpotBugsTask</code> and <code>SpotBugsExtension</code> now accept enum values instead of String instances.

Prism to support EventTime Timers.\r\n\r\nFixes a bug in Go SDK timer handling unset watermark holds would have the wrong default hold. They should default to the firing time.\r\n\r\nTimer implementation tracked in #29772.\r\n\r\nLargely handles event time timers by treating them as data elements in the processing, with the goal of minimizing unique handling of timers vs data.\r\nTimers with the same event time must always sort *after* data elements with the same event time, so they can be reasonably be consolidated when firing.\r\n\r\nSince only a single timer can be set for a [window, user key, timerfamily, tag] tuple we track the last set EventTime + Hold. This avoids scanning the element queue for a key every time a timer is written at the expense that more timers are retained in memory (a \"spend RAM to save CPU\" trade off). This requires managing the remaining \"pending elements\" properly as well, as a timer may be written, but it may not affect size of the pending queue.\r\n\r\nWatermarkHolds are tracked on a per Hold basis. Each stage maintains a heap of their holds, and a map of how many timers are using that hold. When the count goes to 0, we remove the hold from the map, and the heap. This approach avoids tracking holds on a per timer basis, which would mean a much larger hold heap. \r\n\r\nAside: A general improvement that could be made to the Element Manager would be to \"intern\" the user key bytes, tags, and various other strings when persisting the data. This would avoid retaining several copies of each set of bytes in memory between stages (this is a \"spend CPU to save RAM\" trade off). There's also likely opportunity to clean up \"leaked\" tails of large byte buffers when a key prefix is being held (a similar CPU for RAM tradeoff).\r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\nDeferred to a later PR, related to EventTime timers:\r\n* Handling Cleared timers correctly.\r\n  * Fired timers *are* cleared, but a user clearing a timer (eg. because a batch is determined complete, so a GC timer isn't needed) isn't tested yet. It's expected that such a timer will simply fire.\r\n* Handling OnWindowExpiration, because it's not implemented in the Go SDK yet, so it's hard to test.\r\n\r\nBoth are likely to be handled in the process of cleaning up prism for the Java and Python Validates Runner tests.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Typescript SDK has not gotten any meaningful updates for a long time, and while trying to use it, i ran into a lot of issues.\r\n\r\nSo after making some fixes for our project im putting some of those changes in this PR, and i'd love to go over them with the team.\r\n\r\nHere's a summary of the changes:\r\n\r\n- switch out [ttypescript](https://github.com/cevek/ttypescript?tab=readme-ov-file#deprecation-notice) for [ts-patch](https://github.com/nonara/ts-patch)\r\n- update `serialize-closures` and `ts-closure-transform` as the current version does not support typescript `5.x`, here's the upstream pr https://github.com/nokia/ts-serialize-closures/pull/16\r\n- `writeToPubSub` did not work with out `withName` so i added it (format might be wrong)\r\n- removed extra logs: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/29889/commits/6002903ec1a0f2fa449ca97643d42083e21b60be\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your

Streaming harness's metrics container will store `per worker counters` in a new `RemoveSafeDeltaCounterCell`.\r\n\r\nFor the new `PerWorkerMetrics` we want to support dynamically creating metrics that may not live the lifetime of the job, therefore we need to implement garbage collection for stale metrics.\r\n\r\nE.g. We want to support BigQuery Metrics on a per-bigquery-table basis. If the pipeline uses dynamic destinations to write to 100 tables at 12:00 and at 15:00 is only writing to a few tables, the underlying MetricsContainer should not hold on to metrics for all 100 tables.\r\n\r\nIn`RemoveSafeDeltaCounterCell` metric updates and deletions are handled atomically - using `ConcurrentHashMap::compute` and `ConcurrentHashMap::remove` respectively - ensuring safe garbage collection.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

maintain a buffer of element values and their timestamps, then flush when necessary (e.g. after reaching some max num elements). By the time we're forced to flush, we arrive at an element E with a timestamp potentially greater than some/most of the elements we have in the buffer. When we flush and some elements fail, we attempt to output them with their original timestamps, which may be earlier than the timestamp of the current element we are processing. Doing so triggers the following error:\r\n\r\n`Failed to insert row and could not parse the result!`\r\n`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot output with timestamp 2023-12-18T20:26:27.376Z.

https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23373\r\n\r\nPossible (partial) implementation of logical types with arguments. Currently, only map and atomic values are supported.\r\n\r\nAdds an instance method _language_type() to LogicalType that returns the language type for a specific instance of a logical type, i.e. a logical type with a specific argument. For logical types without arguments, this should just return the existing language_type().\r\n\r\nSeveral downsides:\r\n- Types need to be hashable and in practice should define a hash function that is a combination of the class and the argument. This implies the argument needs to be hashable as well.\r\n- PassThroughLogicalTypes cannot have an argument, as it's impossible for the language type to match the representation type while also acting as a container for the argument that is excluded from the representation (by definition).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there's a better way to approach this? I can also remove the EnumerationType from schemas.py and use a test specific schema defined/registered in schemas_test.py.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

support</h2>\n<h2>New model additions</h2>\n<h3>Mixtral</h3>\n<p>Mixtral is the new open-source model from Mistral AI announced by the blogpost <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\">Mixtral of Experts</a>. The model has been proven to have comparable capabilities to Chat-GPT according to the benchmark results shared on the release blogpost.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The architecture is a sparse Mixture of Experts with Top-2 routing strategy, similar as <code>NllbMoe</code> architecture in transformers. You can use it through <code>AutoModelForCausalLM</code> interface:</p>\n<pre lang=\"py\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import torch\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B&quot;, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map=&quot;auto&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;mistralai/Mistral-8x7B&quot;)</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt = &quot;My favourite condiment is&quot;</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; model_inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;).to(device)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; model.to(device)</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>The model is compatible with existing optimisation tools such Flash Attention 2, <code>bitsandbytes</code> and PEFT library. The checkpoints are release under <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mistralai\"><code>mistralai</code></a> organisation on the Hugging Face Hub.</p>\n<h3>Llava / BakLlava</h3>\n<p>Llava is an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LlamA/Vicuna on GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data. It is an auto-regressive language model, based on the transformer architecture. In other words, it is an multi-modal version of LLMs fine-tuned for chat / instructions.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Llava model was proposed in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03744\">Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning</a> by Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li and Yong Jae Lee.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[<code>Llava</code>] Add Llava to transformers  by <a href=\"https://github.com/younesbelkada\"><code>@​younesbelkada</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/27662\">#27662</a></li>\n<li>[LLaVa] Some improvements by <a href=\"https://github.com/NielsRogge\"><code>@​NielsRogge</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/27895\">#27895</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The integration also includes <a href=\"https://github.com/SkunkworksAI/BakLLaVA\"><code>BakLlava</code></a> which is a Llava model trained with Mistral backbone.</p>\n<p>The mode is compatible with <code>&quot;image-to-text&quot;</code> pipeline:</p>\n<pre lang=\"py\"><code>from transformers import pipeline\nfrom PIL import Image    \nimport requests\n<p>model_id = &quot;llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf&quot;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases\">transformers's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.36: Mixtral, Llava/BakLlava, SeamlessM4T v2, AMD ROCm, F.sdpa wide-spread support</h2>\n<h2>New model additions</h2>\n<h3>Mixtral</h3>\n<p>Mixtral is the new open-source model from Mistral AI announced by the blogpost <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\">Mixtral of Experts</a>. The model has been proven to have comparable capabilities to Chat-GPT according to the benchmark results shared on the release blogpost.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The architecture is a sparse Mixture of Experts with Top-2 routing strategy, similar as <code>NllbMoe</code> architecture in transformers. You can use it through <code>AutoModelForCausalLM</code> interface:</p>\n<pre lang=\"py\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import torch\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B&quot;, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map=&quot;auto&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;mistralai/Mistral-8x7B&quot;)</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt = &quot;My favourite condiment is&quot;</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; model_inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;).to(device)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; model.to(device)</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>The model is compatible with existing optimisation tools such Flash Attention 2, <code>bitsandbytes</code> and PEFT library. The checkpoints are release under <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mistralai\"><code>mistralai</code></a> organisation on the Hugging Face Hub.</p>\n<h3>Llava / BakLlava</h3>\n<p>Llava is an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LlamA/Vicuna on GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data.

href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases\">transformers's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.36: Mixtral, Llava/BakLlava, SeamlessM4T v2, AMD ROCm, F.sdpa wide-spread support</h2>\n<h2>New model additions</h2>\n<h3>Mixtral</h3>\n<p>Mixtral is the new open-source model from Mistral AI announced by the blogpost <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\">Mixtral of Experts</a>. The model has been proven to have comparable capabilities to Chat-GPT according to the benchmark results shared on the release blogpost.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The architecture is a sparse Mixture of Experts with Top-2 routing strategy, similar as <code>NllbMoe</code> architecture in transformers. You can use it through <code>AutoModelForCausalLM</code> interface:</p>\n<pre lang=\"py\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import torch\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B&quot;, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map=&quot;auto&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;mistralai/Mistral-8x7B&quot;)</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt = &quot;My favourite condiment is&quot;</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; model_inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;).to(device)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; model.to(device)</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>The model is compatible with existing optimisation tools such Flash Attention 2, <code>bitsandbytes</code> and PEFT library. The checkpoints are release under <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mistralai\"><code>mistralai</code></a> organisation on the Hugging Face Hub.</p>\n<h3>Llava / BakLlava</h3>\n<p>Llava is an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LlamA/Vicuna on GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data. It is an auto-regressive language model, based on the transformer architecture. In other words, it is an multi-modal version of LLMs fine-tuned for chat / instructions.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Llava model was proposed in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03744\">Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning</a> by Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li and Yong Jae Lee.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[<code>Llava</code>] Add Llava to transformers  by <a href=\"https://github.com/younesbelkada\"><code>@​younesbelkada</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/27662\">#27662</a></li>\n<li>[LLaVa] Some improvements by <a href=\"https://github.com/NielsRogge\"><code>@​NielsRogge</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/27895\">#27895</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The integration also includes <a href=\"https://github.com/SkunkworksAI/BakLLaVA\"><code>BakLlava</code></a> which is a Llava model trained with Mistral backbone.</p>\n<p>The mode is compatible with <code>&quot;image-to-text&quot;</code> pipeline:</p>\n<pre lang=\"py\"><code>from transformers import pipeline\nfrom PIL import Image    \nimport requests\n<p>model_id = &quot;llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf&quot;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

support</h2>\n<h2>New model additions</h2>\n<h3>Mixtral</h3>\n<p>Mixtral is the new open-source model from Mistral AI announced by the blogpost <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\">Mixtral of Experts</a>. The model has been proven to have comparable capabilities to Chat-GPT according to the benchmark results shared on the release blogpost.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The architecture is a sparse Mixture of Experts with Top-2 routing strategy, similar as <code>NllbMoe</code> architecture in transformers. You can use it through <code>AutoModelForCausalLM</code> interface:</p>\n<pre lang=\"py\"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import torch\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(&quot;mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B&quot;, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map=&quot;auto&quot;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;mistralai/Mistral-8x7B&quot;)</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt = &quot;My favourite condiment is&quot;</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; model_inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;).to(device)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; model.to(device)</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>The model is compatible with existing optimisation tools such Flash Attention 2, <code>bitsandbytes</code> and PEFT library. The checkpoints are release under <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/mistralai\"><code>mistralai</code></a> organisation on the Hugging Face Hub.</p>\n<h3>Llava / BakLlava</h3>\n<p>Llava is an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LlamA/Vicuna on GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data. It is an auto-regressive language model, based on the transformer architecture. In other words, it is an multi-modal version of LLMs fine-tuned for chat / instructions.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The Llava model was proposed in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03744\">Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning</a> by Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li and Yong Jae Lee.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[<code>Llava</code>] Add Llava to transformers  by <a href=\"https://github.com/younesbelkada\"><code>@​younesbelkada</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/27662\">#27662</a></li>\n<li>[LLaVa] Some improvements by <a href=\"https://github.com/NielsRogge\"><code>@​NielsRogge</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/27895\">#27895</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The integration also includes <a href=\"https://github.com/SkunkworksAI/BakLLaVA\"><code>BakLlava</code></a> which is a Llava model trained with Mistral backbone.</p>\n<p>The mode is compatible with <code>&quot;image-to-text&quot;</code> pipeline:</p>\n<pre lang=\"py\"><code>from transformers import pipeline\nfrom PIL import Image    \nimport requests\n<p>model_id = &quot;llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf&quot;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

exec side transform identification using the global transformID and not the \"UniqueName\". The error occurred prior to the FnAPI becoming solid ~4 years ago, or sufficient understanding to root case it at the time.\r\n\r\nThe Go SDK has been \"refering\" to transforms incorrectly when communicating back to the runner, which largely affects things like metrics. This was noticable in state and timers since only Dataflow implemented additional translations to the Go SDK approach, which was to use the \"UniqueName\" from the transforms.\r\n\r\nThis fix allows enabling additional tests against Spark and Flink runners for state and timers, and presumably fixes handling of metrics.\r\n\r\nPre-cursor to #29772, since it doesn't make sense to try and maintain the transform identification name handling error in Prism, as it's aiming to be a fairly model single machin Portable runner.\r\n\r\nFixes #29848\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
