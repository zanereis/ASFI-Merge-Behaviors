think the issue is the statement in [PIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-41%3A+KafkaConsumer+Max+Records): \"As before, we'd keep track of **which partition we left off** at so that the next iteration **would begin there**.\" I think it should **NOT** use the last partition in the next iteration; **it should pick the next one instead**.\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution to impose the order to pick the next one is to use the order the consumer.internals.Fetcher receives the partition messages, as determined by **completedFetches** queue in that class. To avoid parsing the partition messages repeatedly. we can **save those parsed fetches to a list and maintain the next partition to get messages there.** \r\n\r\n@hachikuji, @lindong28, @guozhangwang,

PR introduces the broker generation concept and leverage it to allow controller to detect fast bounced brokers and allow broker to reject outdated control requests.\r\n\r\nIt has the changes required to implement KIP-380:\r\n\r\n[Common]\r\n- Refactor ZookeeperClient to expose the zookeeper `multi` request directly\r\n- Refactor KafkaZkClient to use MultiRequest instead of raw zookeeper transaciton\r\n- Atomically get creation transaction id (czxid) with broker znode creation and use it as broker epoch to identify broker gerneration across bounces\r\n- Introduce LeaderAndIsrRequest V2, UpdateMetadataRequest V5 and StopReplicaRequest V1 to include broker epoch in control requests and normalize their schemas to make it more memory efficient\r\n- Add STALE_BROKER_EPOCH error\r\n\r\n[Broker]\r\n- Cache the current broker epoch after broker znode registration\r\n- Reject LeaderAndIsrRequest, UpdateMetadataRequest and StopReplicaRequest if the request's broker epoch < current broker epoch, and respond back with STALE_BROKER_EPOCH error\r\n\r\n[Controller]\r\n- Cache/update broker epochs in `controllerContext.brokerEpochsCache` after reading from zk when processing `BrokerChange` event and `onControllerFailover`\r\n- Detect bounced brokers in `BrokerChange` event by comparing the broker epochs get from zk and cached broker epochs and trigger necessary state changes\r\n- Avoid sending out requests to dead brokers\r\n\r\n[Test]\r\n- Add `BrokerEpochIntegrationTest` to test broker processing new versions of the control requests and rejecting requests with stale broker epoch\r\n- Add a test case in `ControllerIntegrationTest` to test controller detecting bounced brokers\r\n- Add test cases in `RequestResponseTest` to test seralization and de-seralization for new versions of the control requests\r\n- Add `ControlRequstTest` unit test to test control requests schemas normalization\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-20T07:38:39Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T06:24:02Z","closed_at":"2018-12-03T06:00:51Z","merged_at":"2018-12-03T06:00:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"2155c6d54b087206b6aa1d58747f141761394eaf","assignee":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5821/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5821/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5821/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/aec83c36f2b7f46b7ffc1990f56e60f0a9811149","head":{"label":"hzxa21:KIP-380-PR","ref":"KIP-380-PR","sha":"aec83c36f2b7f46b7ffc1990f56e60f0a9811149","user":{"login":"hzxa21","id":5518566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5518566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21","html_url":"https://github.com/hzxa21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":131780470,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzE3ODA0NzA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"hzxa21/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hzxa21","id":5518566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTg1NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5518566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21","html_url":"https://github.com/hzxa21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzxa21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hzxa21/kafka","description":"Mirror

Description:\r\n*Make sure that the transaction state is properly cleared when the `transactionalId-expiration` task fails. Operations on that transactional id would otherwise return a`CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS` error and appear \"untouchable\" to transaction state changes, preventing transactional producers from operating until a broker restart or transaction coordinator change.*\r\n\r\n#### Testing:\r\n*Unit tested by verifying that having the `transactionalId-expration` task won't leave the transaction metadata in a pending state if the replica manager returns an error.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

patch has two objectives to improve metadata handling logic and testing:\r\n\r\n1. We want to reduce dependence on the public object `Cluster` for internal metadata propagation since it is not easy to evolve. As an example, we need to propagate leader epochs from the metadata response to `Metadata`, but it is not straightforward to do this without exposing it in `PartitionInfo` since that is what `Cluster` uses internally. By doing this change, we are able to remove some redundant `Cluster` building logic. \r\n2. We want to make the metadata handling in `MockClient` simpler and more consistent. Currently we have mix of metadata update mechanisms which are internally inconsistent with each other and do not match the implementation in `NetworkClient`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-18T00:00:44Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T20:20:14Z","closed_at":"2018-10-30T20:20:14Z","merged_at":"2018-10-30T20:20:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"d71cb54672e63d2f0f4b999668336642a9a63a1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5813/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5813/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5813/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/1ec13e733c482df56c44f4c92463a6de9eab7e3b","head":{"label":"hachikuji:refactor-mock-metadata-handling","ref":"refactor-mock-metadata-handling","sha":"1ec13e733c482df56c44f4c92463a6de9eab7e3b","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35842084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0MjA4NA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"hachikuji/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji/kafka","description":"Mirror

running Connect, the logs contain quite a few warnings about:\r\n\r\n    The configuration '{}' was supplied but isn't a known config.\r\n\r\nThis occurs when Connect creates producers, consumers, and admin clients, because the AbstractConfig is logging unused configuration properties upon construction. It's complicated by the fact that the `Producer`, `Consumer`, and `AdminClient` all create in their constructors private instances of `ProducerConfig`, `ConsumerConfig`, and `AdminClientConfig`, respectively, and the unused properties are logged as warnings there. Because the `AbstractConfig` instances are created by the client components, Connect is not able to call the `ignore(String key)` method to suppress those log warnings.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are no arguments in the Producer, Consumer, or AdminClient public constructors to control whether the configs log these warning in their constructors. While that might be a possible change we want to make in the future, a simpler workaround is for Connect to be more hygienic and pass to the `Producer`, `Consumer`, and `AdminClient` constructors only  those configuration properties that the `ProducerConfig`, `ConsumerConfig`, and `AdminClientConfig` configdefs know about.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes this change for Connect. \r\n\r\nIf this approach is approved, we should consider how far back we want to port this change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

are routinely seeing CI failures from an assertion in `testBlockTimeout()`, which relies on the interaction between (de)allocations against a producer BufferPool, across multiple threads.

the materialization for source KTables in the way that:\r\n\r\n1. If Materialized.as(queryableName) is specified, materialize;\r\n2. If the downstream operator requires to fetch from this KTable via ValueGetters, materialize;\r\n3. If the downstream operator requires to send old values, materialize.\r\n\r\nOtherwise do not materialize the KTable. E.g. `builder.table(\"topic\").filter().toStream().to(\"topic\")` would not create any state stores.\r\n\r\nThere's a couple of minor changes along with PR as well:\r\n\r\n1. KTableImpl's `queryableStoreName` and `isQueryable` are merged into `queryableStoreName` only, and if it is null it means not queryable. As long as it is not null, it should be queryable (i.e. internally generated names will not be used any more).\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, splitted `MaterializedInternal.storeName()` and `MaterializedInternal.queryableName()`. The former can be internally generated and will not be exposed to users. QueryableName can be modified to set to the internal store name if we decide to materialize it during the DSL parsing / physical topology generation phase. And only if queryableName is specified the corresponding KTable is determined to be materialized.\r\n\r\n2. Found some overlapping unit tests among `KTableImplTest`, and `KTableXXTest`, removed them.\r\n\r\n3. There are a few typing bugs found along the way, fixed them as well.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThis PR is an illustration of experimenting a poc towards logical materializations.\r\n\r\nToday we've logically materialized the KTable for filter / mapValues / transformValues if queryableName is not specified via Materialized, but whenever users specify queryableName we will still always materialize. My original goal is to also consider logically materialize for queryable stores, but when implementing it via a wrapped store to apply the transformations on the fly I realized it is tougher than I thought, because we not only need to support `fetch` or `get`, but also needs to support range queries, `approximateNumEntries`, and `isOpen` etc as well, which are not efficient to support. So in the end I'd suggest we still stick with the rule of always materializing if queryableName is specified, and only consider logical materialization otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist
