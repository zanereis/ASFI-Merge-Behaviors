Note: This release works with Vault v1, and a v2 compatible release will follow up soon.\n\n-   **Security** \n    Vaults offer much greater security than defaults files or  environment variables \n\n-   **Centralization** \n    Secure your database credentials, Pro license key, secure urls, and more in one central location.\n    Update your critical properties in one place, and all linked tools and jobs use the new values .\n\n##### \\[PRO] `rollback-on-error` command argument\n\n-   When set to `true` will attempt to rollback a failed update operation.\n-   Note: changesets marked `failonerror=false`, do not count as error, and so do not rollback-on-error\n\n##### \\[OSS] Liquibase Environment variables\n\n-   Now free to all users, not just Pro users.\n-   Learn more at https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/connections/liquibase-environment-variables.html\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n-   \\[PRO] Added new modifyChangeSets tag to support specification of `runWith` attribute

This is designed to solve issues encountered using existing / external screenshot comparison services. For example:\n\n-   Difficulty sharing a single set of baseline images across feature branches\n    -   e.g. developers working on different features will run into failures until their updates can be included in the set of baseline images\n-   Hosted services are limiting for remote developers\n    -   e.g. it isn't possible to run screenshot comparisons without a fast, reliable internet connection\n-   Hosted services have inherent limitations\n    -   e.g. limited number of screenshots with costly overage penalties when using commercial services\n    -   single-threaded performance using an OSS solution locally\n\nThe solution:\n\n-   Run screenshot comparisons in realtime as we take them\n    -   even when running multi-threaded tests\n-   Define comparison settings inline with the tests where the screenshots are taken\n-   Review comparison results and modify screenshot settings directly in the Karate reports\n-   Check-in baseline screenshots and comparison configs with the tests\n    -   developers can make updates in feature branches independent of other branches\n\nKarate now has a [`compareImage`](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate#compare-image) keyword and the corresponding [`karate.compareImage()`](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate#karate-compareimage) JS API.\n\nRefer to [this video](https://youtu.be/wlvmNBraP60) for how to use the HTML UI in the Karate report to inspect, configure and update the screenshots.\n\n#### Graal JS multi-thread issues are solved\n\nThis is a big deal, achieved after [upgrading Graal to version 22.0](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/issues/2009).\n\nAdvanced users of Karate may have run into [some edge cases](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/issues/1883) when trying to pass a JavaScript function to called feature files, especially when `callonce` and `karate.callSingle()` are involved and tests are run in parallel.\nThese issues were mostly solved in 1.1.0 and 1.2.0, but a few rare cases were still reported.\n\nThis issue is [finally resolved along with some code clean-up](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/pull/2081) and we are back to how things were in v0.9.X. You can freely pass JS functions all over the place.\n\n#### New `karate.response` and `karate.request` API\n\nThis specifically solves for retrieving a given header while ignoring the case. While Karate already had support for this in simple `match` statements and via the `configure lowerCaseResponseHeaders` option, there were advanced use-cases that required more control. You can find [more details here](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/issues/1962). Here is an example:\n\n`karate.response.header('content-type')`.\n\nThis also makes [mock request routing based on headers](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/tree/develop/karate-netty#requestheaders) much easier, for e.g. `karate.request.header('foo') == 'bar'`.\n\n#### New option to write mocks in JavaScript\n\nThis is an alternate option for those who want to write more complicated mocks and opens up a lot of possibilities. The \"server side\" JS API is simple, clean and designed to even serve dynamic HTML.\n\nRefer to this documentation for more: [Karate JavaScript Mocks](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/wiki/Karate-JavaScript-Mocks).\n\n#### `contains only deep` for `match`\n\nThis is an enhancement to `match` that makes it possible to assert that a JSON is \"deep equal to\" another - but with the slight twist that JSON array order is ignored. Come to think of it, we should have had this sooner :| This is expected to be very relevant for teams using GraphQL. Details here: [https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/issues/2093](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/issues/2093)\n\n#### `configure abortSuiteOnFailure`\n\nSome teams have requested for being able to stop the entire test suite if one test fails. This will save time when the environment has issues and \"fail fast\" instead of letting the CI job plough on and result in all tests failing. Details here: [https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/issues/2090](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/issues/2090)\n\n#### Easier way to drive dynamic `Scenario Outline`s\n\nSee the new `@setup` life-cycle described below.\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n#### `@setup` life-cycle\n\nThis is an important change that adds a new life-cycle to scenarios. There is a [description and discussion here](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/issues/1905). The updated documentation can be found [here](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/tree/develop#setup).\n\nThe highlights are:\n\n-   adds a way for data to be set-up before a `Scenario` starts\n-   the focus is on returning data, so no \"global\" state modifications are allowed, which keeps things simple\n-   this was introduced specifically to make it easier to setup a JSON array (or function) for Dynamic Scenario Outlines\n-   so you can think of this as a scenario that acts as a \"background\" for a `Scenario Outline` (but can also be called from any `Scenario`)\n-   the Dynamic Scenario Outline had an inconsistency, which is that the `Background` was only run once, but with this change, the `Background` will run before every `Scenario` whether it is\n    -   a normal `Scenario`\n    -   a row from a fixed set of `Examples:` in a \"normal\" `Scenario Outline:`\n    -   or a row generated at runtime by a dynamic `Scenario Outline:` <-- this is the breaking change\n\nHere is a diff of what to expect. In most cases, where you were using a `Background` to \"drive\" a dynamic `Scenario Outline`, the change is to use a `Scenario` tagged with `@setup` instead.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/915480/198892500-7c4b70fb-5446-47ac-a3d1-50b6d8f091ea.png\">\n\n#### Some JS behavior has changed\n##### ℹ️ Ignore this if you have not referred to JS functions *within* other JS functions.\nFor details, see: [https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/issues/2009#issuecomment-1228632313](https://togithub.com/karatelabs/karate/issues/2009#issuecomment-1228632313)\n\n#### Websocket support has changed\n##### ℹ️  Ignore this if you have not used the `karate.webSocket()` API\n\nThis is a breaking change, but the pattern for editing your existing tests is quite straightforward. Here below is a before-and-after:\n\n<p>\n<img width=\"1230\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/915480/182842067-9156671d-6e2e-400a-ad68-d9e0c1789171.png\">\n</p>\n\n-   the `socket.listen(5000)` call has to be replaced with `* listen 5000` - where 5000 (here just an example) is the timeout in milliseconds\n-   the magic-variable `listenResult` holds the result of the captured websocket message\n-   more details are in the docs: https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/tree/develop#websocket\n\n### Heads Up\n\n1.3.0 will be the last release of Karate that allows for usage of Java 8. From 1.4.0 onwards, Karate will have a minimum requirement of Java 11.
