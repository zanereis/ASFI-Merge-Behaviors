PR makes all of the Scala's `case class`'s final to ensure correctness of Kafka's Scala code that uses these case classes. In Scala its best practice to make `case class`'s final since `case class` automatically generates critical methods such as `hashcode`/`equals`/`unapply` which can break code if user's override these methods by subclassing.\r\n\r\nPlease see the [KIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-754%3A+Make+Scala+case+class%27s+final) for more info.\r\n\r\nChanges of note have been

This kind of change is actually difficult to test for, so this relies upon existing unit and integration tests.\r\n\r\nUsers may run into this whenever validating a connector configuration where the connector implementation takes more than the 90 seconds to actually validate the configuration. \r\n* Without this fix, the `PUT /connector-plugins/(string:name)/config/validate` REST requests might **_not_** return `500 Internal Server Error` and may block (the request thread) for a long period of time. \r\n* With this fix, the `PUT /connector-plugins/(string:name)/config/validate` REST requests might **_not_** return `500 Internal Server Error` if the connector does not complete the validation of a connector configuration within 90 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe user will not see a difference between the behavior before or after this fix if/when the connectors complete validation of connector configurations before 90 seconds, since the method will return those results to the client.\r\n\r\n###

unfenced broker in the cluster and the number of requested partitions in a CREATE_TOPICS request is greater than 1.\r\n\r\nThis patch refactors out some argument sanity checks and invokes those checks in both `RackList` and `StripedReplicaPlacer`, and it adds tests for this as well as the single broker placement issue.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

While the ideal solution would be to have a quota (so a user ends up evicting only their own sessions once quota was reached), the fetch session cache is very performance sensitive, and this problem is very rare, so logging seems like a reasonable first step.","created_at":"2021-06-02T12:05:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T03:36:23Z","closed_at":"2025-01-02T03:36:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

trogdor `ConsumeBenchWorker` has a bug. It allows several consumption tasks to be run in parallel, the number is configurable using the `threadsPerWorker` config. If one of the consumption tasks completes executing successfully due to `maxMessages` being consumed, then, the consumption task prematurely notifies the `doneFuture` causing the entire  `ConsumeBenchWorker` to halt. This becomes a problem when more than 1 consumption task is running in parallel, because the successful completion of 1 of the tasks shuts down the entire worker while the other tasks are still running. When the worker is shut down, it kills all the active consumption tasks, though they have not consumed `maxMessages` yet. This is not the desired behavior.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce?:**\r\nThe bug is easily reproducible by running a `ConsumeBenchSpec` task configured with `maxMessages` value and `threadsPerWorker` > 1. When a trogdor workload is started with such a spec, and when one of the threads (i.e. consumption task) has consumed `maxMessages`, you can notice that it prematurely shuts down the worker although the other threads have **not** yet consumed at least `maxMessages`.\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\nThe fix is to defer the notification of the `doneFuture` to the `CloseStatusUpdater` thread. This thread is already responsible for tracking the status of the tasks and updating their status when all of the tasks complete, so this seems like the right place to inject the `doneFuture` notification.","created_at":"2021-05-31T07:56:44Z","updated_at":"2021-06-03T07:30:21Z","closed_at":"2021-06-02T18:30:29Z","merged_at":"2021-06-02T18:30:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"13ba9c9305343d5b11bf26d72d1688cda1d5fd60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/15d3e2b96ffbc7eedac61e5ac86b96cc3e3191ff","head":{"label":"kowshik:KAFKA-12867_fix_trogdor_ConsumeBenchWorker","ref":"KAFKA-12867_fix_trogdor_ConsumeBenchWorker","sha":"15d3e2b96ffbc7eedac61e5ac86b96cc3e3191ff","user":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239427959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk0Mjc5NTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"kowshik/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik/kafka","description":"Mirror

Kafka Raft mode, the flow sending request from client to controller is like this:\r\n1. client send reqesut to a random controller (ex: A-controller)\r\n2. A-controller will forward the request to active controller (ex: B-controller) to handle the request\r\n3. After active B-controller completed the request, the A-controller will receive the response, and do a check:\r\n  3.1. if the response has \"disconnected\" or \"NOT_CONTROLLER\" error, which means the cached active controller is changed. So, clear the cached active controller, and wait for next retry to get the updated active controller from `controllerNodeProvider`\r\n  3.2. else, complete the request and respond back to client\r\n\r\nIn this bug, we have 2 issues existed:\r\n1. \"NOT_CONTROLLER\" exception won't be correctly send back to the requester, instead, `UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR` will be returned. The reason is the `NotControllerException` is wrapped by a `CompletionException` when the `Future` completeExceptionally. And the `CompletionException` will not match any Errors we defined, so the `UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR` will be returned. Even if we don't want the `NotControllerException` return back to client, we need to know it to do some check.\r\n\r\nfix 1: unwrap the `CompletionException` before encoding the exception to error.\r\n\r\n2. Even if we fixed 1st bug, we still haven't fixed this issue. After the 1st bug fixed, the client can successfully get `NotControllerException` now, and keep retrying... until timeout. So, why won't it meet the flow `3.1` mentioned above, since it has `NotControllerException`? The reason is, we wrapped the original request with `EnvelopeRequest` and forwarded to active controller. So, after the active controller completed the request, responded with `NotControllerException`, and then, wrapped into an `EnvelopeResponse` **with no error**, and then send the `EnvelopeResponse` back. That is, in the flow `3.1`, we only got \"no error\" from `EnvelopeResponse`, not the `NotControllerException` inside.\r\n\r\nnew: fix 2: Make the envelope response return `NotControllerException` if the controller response has `NotControllerException`. So that we can catch the `NotControllerException` on envelopeResponse to update the active controller.\r\n\r\nold: fix 2: in flow `3.1`, parse the `EnvelopeResponse` to check if there's `NotControllerException` inside.\r\n\r\nNote: in the jira ticket we think there's `Recorded new controller` log, which should already changed to new active controller:\r\n```\r\n[broker0_:BrokerToControllerChannelManager broker=0 name=heartbeat]: Recorded new controller, from now on will use broker localhost:54229 (id: 3000 rack: null) \r\n```\r\nIt's is true, but after further investigation, I found it only changed for this thread: `broker0_:BrokerToControllerChannelManager broker=0 name=heartbeat`. The topic creation thread is forwarding thread: `broker0_:BrokerToControllerChannelManager broker=0 name=forwarding`, which still using old  active controller.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

1: [#10609](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10609)\r\nPt. 2: [#10683](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10683)\r\nPt. 3: [#10788](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10788)\r\n\r\nIn Pt. 3 we implement the `addNamedTopology` API. This can be used to update the processing topology of a running Kafka Streams application without resetting the app, or even pausing/restarting the process. It's up to the user to ensure that this API is called on every instance of an application to ensure all clients are able to run the newly added NamedTopology. This should not be too much of a burden as it only requires that each client eventually be updated by the user -- under the covers, Streams will take care of keeping the internal state consistent while various clients wait to converge on the latest view of the full topology.\r\n\r\nInternally, when a new NamedTopology is added a rebalance will be triggered to distribute the tasks that correspond to it. To minimize disruption and wasted work, the assignor just computes the desired eventual assignment of these new tasks to clients regardless of whether the target client has been issued the `addNamedTopology` request yet. If a client receives tasks for a NamedTopology it does not yet recognize, it stashes them away and continues to process its other topologies. Once it receives this new NamedTopology, those tasks will be created and begin processing without triggering a new rebalance. If the new NamedTopology does not match any unknown tasks it has received, then the client must trigger a fresh rebalance for this new NamedTopology.","created_at":"2021-05-29T01:53:24Z","updated_at":"2021-08-06T07:19:26Z","closed_at":"2021-08-06T07:18:27Z","merged_at":"2021-08-06T07:18:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"6854eb8332d6ef1f1c6216d2f67d6e146b1ef60f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10788/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10788/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10788/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/623e7d3514516f355b468e4b23e45d33b8ecab22","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:12648-Pt3-addNamedTopology-API","ref":"12648-Pt3-addNamedTopology-API","sha":"623e7d3514516f355b468e4b23e45d33b8ecab22","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

Improve the documentation and API for the snapshot classes to highlight the distinction between the offset of batches in the snapshot vs the offset of batches in the log.

does not shutdown this executor. This is normally okay in the Connect runtime and MirrorMaker 2 runtimes, because the worker is stopped only when the JVM is stopped (via the shutdown hook in the herders).\r\n\r\nHowever, we instantiate and stop the herder many times in our integration tests, and this means we're not necessarily shutting down the herder's executor. Normally this won't hurt, as long as all of the runnables that the executor threads run actually do terminate. But it's possible those threads might not terminate in all tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

we find a .swap file on startup, we typically want to rename and replace it as .log, .index, .timeindex, etc. as a way to complete any ongoing replace operations. These swap files are usually known to have been flushed to disk before the replace operation begins.\r\n\r\nOne flaw in the current logic is that we recover these swap files on startup and as part of that, end up truncating the producer state and rebuild it from scratch. This is unneeded as the replace operation does not mutate the producer state by itself. It is only meant to replace the .log file along with corresponding indices. Because of this unneeded producer state rebuild operation, we have seen multi-hour startup times for clusters that have large compacted topics.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue. With ext4 ordered mode, the metadata are ordered and no matter it is a clean/unclean shutdown. As a result, we rework the recovery workflow as follows.\r\n\r\n1. If there are any `.cleaned` files, we delete all `.swap` files with higher/equal offsets due to KAFKA-6264. We also delete the `.cleaned` files. If no `.cleaned` file, do nothing for this step.\r\n2. If there are any `.log.swap` files left after step 1, they, together with their index files, must be renamed from `.cleaned` and are complete (renaming from `.cleaned` to `.swap` is in reverse offset order). We rename these `.log.swap` files and their corresponding index files to regular files, while deleting the original files from compaction or segment split if they haven't been deleted.\r\n3. Do log splitting for legacy log segments with offset overflow (KAFKA-6264)\r\n4. If there are any other index swap files left, they must come from partial renaming from `.swap` files to regular files. We can simply rename them to regular files.\r\n\r\ncredit: some code is copied from @dhruvilshah3 's PR: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10388\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

upgrading to IBP 2.8, topic ID can end up getting reassigned which can cause errors in LeaderAndIsr handling when the partition metadata files from the previous ID are still on the broker. \r\n\r\nTopic IDs are stored in the TopicZNode. The behavior of the code before this fix is as follows:\r\nConsider we had a controller with IBP 2.8+. Each topic will be assigned topic IDs and LeaderAndIsr requests will write partition.metadata files to the brokers. If we re-elect the controller and end up with a controller with an older IBP version and we reassign partitions, the TopicZNode is overwritten and we lose the topic ID. Upon electing a 2.8+ IBP controller, we will see the TopicZNode is missing a topic ID and will generate a new one. If the broker still has the old partition metadata file, we will see an ID mismatch that causes the error.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes controller logic so that we maintain the topic ID in the controller and the ZNode even when IBP < 2.8. This means that in the scenario above, reassigning partitions will not result in losing the topic ID and reassignment.\r\n\r\nTopic IDs may be lost when downgrading the code below version 2.8, but upon re-upgrading to code version 2.8+, before bumping the IBP, all partition metadata files will be deleted to prevent any errors.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

full details, please see [KIP-904](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/P5VbDg). \r\n\r\n# Problem\r\nDuring `KTable.groupBy`, we write into a repartition topic. Since the grouping key can change, we need to send separate events for the oldValue and the newValue to downstream nodes (where they will be “subtracted” and “added” respectively from/to the aggregate for the old key and the new key respectively). \r\n\r\nHowever, sending the oldValue and the newValue as separate events is not strictly necessary when the grouping key does not change and doing so poses two challenges for users: \r\n1. Firstly, the resulting KTable (i.e. the result of `KTable.groupBy(???).aggregate(???)`) can briefly be in an “inconsistent” state where the oldValue has been “subtracted” from the aggregate for the key but the newValue has not yet been “added” to the aggregate of the key because each event (oldValue, newValue) is processed separately.  \r\n2. Secondly, if users fail to correctly configure their producers correctly to avoid re-ordering during `send()`, it’s possible the newValue may be sent (and therefore processed by the aggregator) before the oldValue. If the user’s`adder` and `subtractor` functions are non-commutative, this would put the aggregate in a permanently “inconsistent” state. \r\n\r\nWhilst there are ways to get around this issue by dropping down to the Processor API level, it would be nicer if this was handled by Kafka Streams more seamlessly. \r\n\r\n# Solution\r\nIf the grouping key has not changed, the oldValue and newValue events are guaranteed to be processed by the same processor.  As such, we should be able to send them as a single `Change<T>` event. The subtractor and adder functions can then be executed (in that order) and the KTable can be updated in a single “atomic” operation. In this way, we are able to remove any possibility of ending up in an “inconsistent” state. Also, note that sending the oldValue and newValue in the same event ensures that they can’t be re-ordered relative to each other irrespective of how a user has configured the producer settings.
