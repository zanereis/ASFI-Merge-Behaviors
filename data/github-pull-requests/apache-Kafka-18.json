older clients will have deserialization problems if a KIP-584 feature's minimum supported level is 0.  Therefore, when preparing an ApiVersionResponse for a version less than 4, we must omit features with a minimum supported level of 0. This is reasonable to do because older software could not handle setting these features to a level other than 0 in any case.\r\n\r\nA similar problem applies to BrokerRegistrationRequest. Here we must omit features with minVersion = 0 when the RPC version is less than 4.\r\n\r\nNote that this fix supersedes an earlier compatibility preservation effort in

the code in `ShareConsumeRequestManager` works on the basis that there can only be one `commitSync()`/`close()` at a time. But there is a chance these calls timeout on the application thread, but are still sent later on the background thread. This will mean the incoming commitSync()/close() will not be processed, resulting in possible loss of acknowledgements.\r\n\r\nTo cover this case, we will now have a list of `AcknowledgeRequestStates` to store the `commitSyncs()` and a separate requestState to store the `close()`. This queue will be processed one by one until its empty. For `close()`, we are still assuming there can only be one active `close()` at a time.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-09T14:26:13Z","updated_at":"2024-09-13T11:24:06Z","closed_at":"2024-09-13T11:24:06Z","merged_at":"2024-09-13T11:24:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a79fabacfeb7bb7a182ca676be36fc2da81d26d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17136/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17136/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17136/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/28cbb7c1a5bb45aaffaf6a573fa364bf3db46f8b","head":{"label":"ShivsundarR:KAFKA-17502","ref":"KAFKA-17502","sha":"28cbb7c1a5bb45aaffaf6a573fa364bf3db46f8b","user":{"login":"ShivsundarR","id":123350799,"node_id":"U_kgDOB1ovDw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123350799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR","html_url":"https://github.com/ShivsundarR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":753533914,"node_id":"R_kgDOLOoD2g","name":"kafka","full_name":"ShivsundarR/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ShivsundarR","id":123350799,"node_id":"U_kgDOB1ovDw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123350799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR","html_url":"https://github.com/ShivsundarR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShivsundarR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ShivsundarR/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR resumes and improves the work done on #13842.\r\n\r\nI have refacted the script and workflow files, breaking the code into functions and adjusting naming and operations. Now we have three files: `refresh_collaborators.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `refresh_collaborators.yml`. I have replaced the dash with an underscore in filenames to adequate them to the standards for Python (see [PEP-8]) and GitHub Workflow YAML files as other workflows in the project use snake case. I have created a requirements file to facilitate dependency management.\r\n\r\nFor `refresh_collaborators.py`, I have broken the code into functions. I hope it helps us read and maintain the code. There are some observations for `get_top_contributors` and `update_yaml_content` functions.\r\n\r\nFor `get_top_contributors` function, the best approach I have used to do it is to filter commits of last year and apply a search by its authors in repo contributors. I cannot find a way as out-of-the-box as insight graphs of the contributor's page as neither PyGitHub nor GitHub REST API offers an interface to get contributors by top contributions for last year (see [GitHub-List-Contributors] and [PyGitHub-Get-Contributors]).\r\n\r\nFor `update_yaml_content` function, I have used `collaborators.copy()` to avoid to create anchors. Although ruamel preserves comments, I have noticed that ruamel has been unable to parse them correctly, causing missing comments for `github.collaborators`, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# This list allows you to trigger builds on pull requests. It can have a maximum of 10 people.\r\n# https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=INFRA&title=Git+-+.asf.yaml+features#Git.asf.yamlfeatures-JenkinsPRwhitelisting\r\njenkins:\r\n  github_whitelist:\r\n    - blabla\r\ngithub:\r\n  collaborators:\r\n    - blabla\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I have discovered it works well since we move comments into collections, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\njenkins:\r\n  # This list allows you to trigger builds on pull requests. It can have a maximum of 10 people.\r\n  # https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=INFRA&title=Git+-+.asf.yaml+features#Git.asf.yamlfeatures-JenkinsPRwhitelisting\r\n  github_whitelist:\r\ngithub:\r\n  # This list allows you to triage pull requests. It can have a maximum of 10 people.\r\n  # https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=INFRA&title=Git+-+.asf.yaml+features#Git.asf.yamlfeatures-AssigningexternalcollaboratorswiththetriageroleonGitHub\r\n  collaborators:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach seems right for me too as it pretty documents the list (github_whitelist/collaborators), not the collection (jenkins/github).\r\n\r\nI have run a test on my fork (see [Test]). Disregard the missing Jenkins comment as it was not fixed when I ran this test.\r\n\r\n[PEP-8]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names\r\n[GitHub-List-Contributors]:

field to the ListOffsets request. This timeout is applicable only for the topic/partitions that are enabled with remote storage. \r\n\r\nWhen the timeout is defined in the request, then we use it to define the delay timeout for DelayedRemoteListOffsets request. When the timeout is not defined (requests from older client), then we take the dynamic `remote.list.offsets.request.timeout.ms` server config as the timeout.\r\n\r\nConsumer and Admin client behavior are different. Consumer retries the LIST_OFFSETS request in-case of an error but not the AdminClient. And, consumer timeouts the request, if the response exceeds `request.timeout.ms`, whereas, AdminClient timeouts the request when it exceeds the `default.api.timeout.ms`. \r\n\r\nTo retain the same behavior, we are passing the requestTimeoutMs as timeout from the consumer and defaultApiTimeout / overwritten ListOffsetsOption timeout from the admin.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

property was removed in #17066 to prevent test failures from being cached. However, this breaks the JUnit report and makes the github workflow less user friendly. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that we are copying the junit test report files into a new directory (added in #17098) in a Gradle `doLast` closure. If we don't run with `ignoreFailures=true`, then this closure will not run and the test failures won't be processed by junit.py. \r\n\r\nThis patch adds logic to ensure the doLast closure of `:test` is always run. The user provided `-PignoreFailures` is still honored for the test tasks.","created_at":"2024-09-05T22:35:12Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T18:47:56Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T18:47:42Z","merged_at":"2024-09-06T18:47:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"62379d7d538c0a827cd754fdaf859af95031f4fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7388474305,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABuGMrwQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/build","name":"build","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Gradle

test has a tricky race condition.  We want the restoration to go slow enough so that when a second Kafka Streams instance starts, the restoration of a given TopicPartition pauses due to task re-assignment.  But after that point, we'd like the test to proceed faster to avoid any timeout assertions.  To that end, here are the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Increase the restore pause to 2 seconds; this should slow the restoration enough so that the process is still in progress once the second instance starts.  But once tasks are re-assigned and `onRestorePause` is called, the restore pause is decremented to zero, allowing the test to proceed faster.\r\n- Increase the restore batch to its original value of 5 - otherwise, the test moved too slowly.\r\n- Decrease the number of test records produced to the original value of 100.  By increasing the time of restoring each batch until Kafka Streams calls `onRestorePause` and removing the intentional restoration slowness, 100 records proved good enough in local testing.\r\n\r\n###

#17066, we fixed caching for \":jar\" and \":test\" tasks. However, now in PRs, the test results will be restored as part of the Gradle cache resolution. This means tasks which show as FROM-CACHE and are not run will still have test results in their build directory. To avoid incorrectly reporting these results in the job summary, this patch uses a `doLast` task handler to relocate JUnit XML files into a new directory.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to move the test summary logic from junit.py into a Gradle task that can properly hook into the Gradle lifecycle. However, this approach seems to work and is less complex.","created_at":"2024-09-04T23:00:03Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T17:50:39Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T17:50:33Z","merged_at":"2024-09-05T17:50:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"84aa5d7a633826503ed69badd838b55552ef929c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7388474305,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABuGMrwQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/build","name":"build","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Gradle

3.9 is our last 3.x release, it is a likely version for users to be on when doing ZK to KRaft migrations. Since we have made many fixes since the initial preview of migrations in 3.4, we should ensure that users cannot start a migration without certain improvements. Specifically, we do not want any users attempting migrations without the support of KIP-868 Metadata Transactions. \r\n\r\nThis patch prevents the controller from activating if the log is empty, migrations are enabled, and the bootstrap metadata version does not support transactions.\r\n\r\nIf the log is not empty on startup, as in the case of a software upgrade, we allow the migration to continue where it left off.","created_at":"2024-09-04T18:55:34Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T17:28:54Z","closed_at":"2024-09-06T17:28:54Z","merged_at":"2024-09-06T17:28:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"d067ed0a2f1e841f7d591dc0901065f750227117","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/17094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/17094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/88fb21467c456290e0852da4baf3fb5203328ca6","head":{"label":"mumrah:gh-KAFKA-17457","ref":"gh-KAFKA-17457","sha":"88fb21467c456290e0852da4baf3fb5203328ca6","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

is best to split it into two separate tests.\r\nWe should also move this to ConsumerMetadata.java\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

several modules, we include a `kafka-version.properties` in the Jar file. This file includes the Git SHA of the project at the time of the build. This means that even if no source files change, the `:jar` task will never be UP-TO-DATE between two git commits. Ultimately, this breaks Gradle caching.\r\n\r\nThis patch marks all of the `createVersionFile` tasks as cacheable and also changes our Gradle invocation to override the commit ID to a dummy static value. This will allow the `:jar` task to be cacheable and reusable between builds.\r\n\r\nThis patch also configures the trunk build to only write to the build cache and not read from it. This will prevent any cache pollution/corruption from propagating from build to build.","created_at":"2024-08-31T18:21:57Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T19:06:11Z","closed_at":"2024-09-04T19:06:11Z","merged_at":"2024-09-04T19:06:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"0294b1402d382dc628f42f6e41f093d4ee73ee98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7388474305,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABuGMrwQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/build","name":"build","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Gradle

Instead of having 4 different handlers for this, now using AcknowledgeRequestType, we could merge the code and have only 2 handler functions, one for ShareAcknowledge success and one for ShareAcknowledge failure, eliminating the need for the interface.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug - We were not using the time at which the response was received while handling the ShareAcknowledge response, we were using an outdated time. Now the bug is fixed.","created_at":"2024-08-30T13:57:39Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T03:31:49Z","closed_at":"2024-09-03T03:31:49Z","merged_at":"2024-09-03T03:31:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"743e185c8bf6d1d548fe7041ce543c7c31388e68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6979675393,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABoAVlAQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-932","name":"KIP-932","color":"DA462F","default":false,"description":"Queues

About\r\nFor the share groups fetch request processing, we have an recursive approach of dealing with individual fetch requests. While  it works fine with less no. of records (< 1,000,000) and lesser sharing (< 5 share consumers), it seems that some requests are getting stuck when we increase the load and try to increase the throughput. I've replaced this approach by removing the unlocking and locking of fetch queue in between entries. This had reduced the complexity and also removes the reliability issue on increasing the load.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe code has been tested with the help of unit

KIP-714 was developed, the entity type of `client-metrics` was added to the `kafka-configs.sh` tool. The idea was to have two forms of specifying the name and type of a client metrics config resource, either `--entity-type client-metrics --entity-name NAME` or `--client-metrics NAME`. This style of alias is used for all of the entity types. Unfortunately, the `--client-metrics` form was not implemented. This PR corrects that and adds more tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build
