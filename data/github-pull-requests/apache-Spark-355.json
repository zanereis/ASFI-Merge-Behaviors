Generic Hint Syntax**\nThe generic hints are parsed and transformed into concrete hints by `SubstituteHints` of **Analyzer**. The unknown hints are removed, too. For example, `Hint(\"MAPJOIN\")` is transformed into `BroadcastJoin` and other hints are removed currently.\n\n``` sql\nSELECT /*+ MAPJOIN(t) */ * FROM t\nSELECT /*+ STREAMTABLE(a,b,c) */ * FROM t\nSELECT /*+ INDEX(t emp_job_ix) */ * FROM t\n```\n\nUnlink Hive, `NEWMAPJOIN(t)` is allowed for accepting new Spark Hints.\n\n**2. Broadcast Hints**\nThe followings are recognized. Technically, broadcast hints are matched `UnresolvedRelation` to support Hive `MetastoreRelation`. The style of `database_name.table_name` is not allowed in this PR.\n\n``` sql\nSELECT /*+ MAPJOIN(t) */ * FROM t JOIN u ON t.id = u.id\nSELECT /*+ BROADCAST(u) */ * FROM t JOIN u ON t.id = u.id\nSELECT /*+ BROADCASTJOIN(u) */ * FROM t JOIN u ON t.id = u.id\n```\n\n**Examples**\n\n``` scala\nscala> spark.range(1000000000).createOrReplaceTempView(\"t\")\nscala>

is a pull request that was originally merged against branch-1.6 as #12000, now being merged into master as well.  @srowen @zzcclp @JoshRosen \n\nThis pull request fixes an issue in which cluster-mode executors fail to properly register a JDBC driver when the driver is provided in a jar by the user, but the driver class name is derived from a JDBC URL (rather than specified by the user). The consequence of this is that all JDBC accesses under the described circumstances fail with an IllegalStateException. I reported the issue here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14204\n\nMy proposed solution is to have the executors register the JDBC driver class under all circumstances, not only when the driver is specified by the user.\n\nThis patch was tested manually. I built an assembly jar, deployed it to a cluster, and confirmed that the problem was fixed.\n","created_at":"2016-07-30T13:26:44Z","updated_at":"2016-08-03T20:17:21Z","closed_at":"2016-08-03T20:17:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"843abe4e8995e72d9c0a812320edb190061195a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14420/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14420/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14420/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0bd08ef36b8b4ed073fcdc2f88927389593e47f","head":{"label":"mchalek:mchalek-jdbc_driver_registration","ref":"mchalek-jdbc_driver_registration","sha":"c0bd08ef36b8b4ed073fcdc2f88927389593e47f","user":{"login":"mchalek","id":3099936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTk5MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3099936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek","html_url":"https://github.com/mchalek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50065131,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDA2NTEzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"mchalek/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mchalek","id":3099936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTk5MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3099936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek","html_url":"https://github.com/mchalek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mchalek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mchalek/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe catalyst package is meant to be internal, and as a result it does not make sense to mark things as private[sql] or private[spark]. It simply makes debugging harder when Spark developers need to inspect the plans at runtime.\n\nThis patch removes all private[sql] and private[spark] visibility modifiers in org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A - just visibility

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe are proposing addition of pro-active block replication in case of executor failures. BlockManagerMasterEndpoint does all the book-keeping to keep a track of all the executors and the blocks they hold. It also keeps a track of which executors are alive through heartbeats. When an executor is removed, all this book-keeping state is updated to reflect the lost executor. This step can be used to identify executors that are still in possession of a copy of the cached data and a message could be sent to them to use the existing \"replicate\" function to find and place new replicas on other suitable hosts. Blocks replicated this way will let the master know of their existence.\n\nThis can happen when an executor is lost, and would that way be pro-active as opposed be being done at query time.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch was tested with existing unit tests along with new unit tests added to test the functionality.\n","created_at":"2016-07-29T22:00:33Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T23:42:22Z","closed_at":"2017-02-24T23:42:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f3b34042c9d39bfee56feb0968c72f1d682d36f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14412/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14412/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14412/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/212baab8c2beffed77647db2b9f190d101019063","head":{"label":"shubhamchopra:ProactiveBlockReplication","ref":"ProactiveBlockReplication","sha":"212baab8c2beffed77647db2b9f190d101019063","user":{"login":"shubhamchopra","id":6588487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODg0ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6588487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra","html_url":"https://github.com/shubhamchopra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59029814,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTAyOTgxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"shubhamchopra/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shubhamchopra","id":6588487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1ODg0ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6588487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra","html_url":"https://github.com/shubhamchopra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shubhamchopra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shubhamchopra/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn Spark 2.0, `SaveAsTable` does not work when source DataFrame is built on a Hive Table, but Spark 1.6 works.\n\n**Spark 1.6**\n\n``` Scala\nscala> sql(\"create table sample.sample stored as SEQUENCEFILE as select 1 as key, 'abc' as value\")\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\n\nscala> val df = sql(\"select key, value as value from sample.sample\")\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [key: int, value: string]\n\nscala> df.write.mode(\"append\").saveAsTable(\"sample.sample\")\n\nscala> sql(\"select * from sample.sample\").show()\n+---+-----+\n|key|value|\n+---+-----+\n|  1|  abc|\n|  1|  abc|\n+---+-----+\n```\n\n**Spark 2.0**\n\n``` Scala\nscala> df.write.mode(\"append\").saveAsTable(\"sample.sample\")\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Saving data in MetastoreRelation sample, sample\n is not supported.;\n```\n\nSo far, we do not plan to support it in Spark 2.0. Spark 1.6 works because it internally uses `insertInto`. But, if we change it back it will break the semantic of `saveAsTable` (this method uses by-name resolution instead of using by-position resolution used by `insertInto`).\n\nInstead, users should use `insertInto` API. This PR corrects the error messages. Users can understand how to bypass it before we support it in a separate PR.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nTest cases are added\n","created_at":"2016-07-29T21:30:38Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T04:40:18Z","closed_at":"2016-10-03T04:40:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9266f16ab66a15f7ae2cf2bc193b2d92feeb5332","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14410/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14410/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14410/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4f383cea3e836cbd95024811dbb7677cc401b95","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:saveAsTable","ref":"saveAsTable","sha":"f4f383cea3e836cbd95024811dbb7677cc401b95","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

`listType`) instead because the new method checks if the name of elements in Parquet's `LIST` is `element` in Parquet schema and throws an exception if not. However, It seems Spark prior to 1.4.x writes `ArrayType` with Parquet's `LIST` but with `array` as its element name.\n\nTherefore, this PR avoids to use both `listOfElements` and `listType` but just use the existing schema builder to construct the same `GroupType`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should cover this.\n","created_at":"2016-07-29T07:38:02Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:39:58Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T16:42:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87ff1e30840c2c139b91ea7427f0db92a06fe4d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14399/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14399/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14399/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c2e2cb8e405d9653e1f50d320e5fd78bca06f6bf","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16777","ref":"SPARK-16777","sha":"c2e2cb8e405d9653e1f50d320e5fd78bca06f6bf","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRemoves the deprecated timestamp constructor and incidentally fixes the use which was using system timezone rather than the one specified when working near DST.\n\nThis change also causes the roundtrip tests to fail since it now actually uses all the timezones near DST boundaries where it didn't before.\n\nNote: this is only a partial the solution, longer term we should follow up with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16788 to avoid this problem & simplify our timezone handling code.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew tests for two timezones added so even if user timezone happens to coincided with one, the other tests should still fail.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR changes the CTE resolving rule to use only **forward-declared** tables in order to prevent infinite loops. More specifically, new logic is like the following.\n- Resolve CTEs in `WITH` clauses first before replacing the main SQL body.\n- When resolving CTEs, only forward-declared CTEs or base tables are referenced.\n  - Self-referencing is not allowed any more.\n  - Cross-referencing is not allowed any more.\n\n**Reported Error Scenarios**\n\n``` scala\nscala> sql(\"WITH t AS (SELECT 1 FROM t) SELECT * FROM t\")\njava.lang.StackOverflowError\n...\nscala> sql(\"WITH t1 AS (SELECT * FROM t2), t2 AS (SELECT 2 FROM t1) SELECT * FROM t1, t2\")\njava.lang.StackOverflowError\n...\n```\n\nNote that `t`, `t1`, and `t2` are not declared in database. Spark falls into infinite loops before resolving table names.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins tests with new two testcases.\n","created_at":"2016-07-29T05:00:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-17T09:41:05Z","closed_at":"2016-08-12T17:09:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e1a0419c6e98c77409a020cd9acc6281a9050413","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14397/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14397/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14397/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f1f4a833276c5b78309546beca9dd7a5d86590f8","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-16771-TREENODE","ref":"SPARK-16771-TREENODE","sha":"f1f4a833276c5b78309546beca9dd7a5d86590f8","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0db373aaf87991207a7a8a09853b6fa602f0f45b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe behavior of `SparkContext.addFile()` changed slightly with the introduction of the Netty-RPC-based file server, which was introduced in Spark 1.6 (where it was disabled by default) and became the default / only file server in Spark 2.0.0.\n\nPrior to 2.0, calling `SparkContext.addFile()` with files that have the same name and identical contents would succeed. This behavior was never explicitly documented but Spark has behaved this way since very early 1.x versions.\n\nIn 2.0 (or 1.6 with the Netty file server enabled), the second `addFile()` call will fail with a requirement error because NettyStreamManager tries to guard against duplicate file registration.\n\nThis problem also affects `addJar()` in a more subtle way: the `fileServer.addJar()` call will also fail with an exception but that exception is logged and ignored; I believe that the problematic exception-catching path was mistakenly copied from some old code which was only relevant to very old versions of Spark and YARN mode.\n\nI believe that this change of behavior was unintentional, so this patch weakens the `require` check so that adding the same filename at the same path will succeed.\n\nAt file download time, Spark tasks will fail with exceptions if an executor already has a local copy of a file and that file's contents do not match the contents of the file being downloaded / added. As a result, it's important that we prevent files with the same name and different contents from being served because allowing that can effectively brick an executor by preventing it from successfully launching any new tasks. Before this patch's change, this was prevented by forbidding `addFile()` from being called twice on files with the same name. Because Spark does not defensively copy local files that are passed to `addFile` it is vulnerable to files' contents changing, so I think it's okay to rely on an implicit assumption that these files are intended to be immutable (since if they _are_ mutable then this can lead to either explicit task failures or implicit incorrectness (in case new executors silently get newer copies of the file while old executors continue to use an older version)). To guard against this, I have decided to only update the file addition timestamps on the first call to `addFile()`; duplicate calls will succeed but will not update the timestamp. This behavior is fine as long as we assume files are immutable, which seems reasonable given the behaviors described above.\n\nAs part of this change, I also improved the thread-safety of the `addedJars` and `addedFiles` maps; this is important because these maps may be concurrently read by a task launching thread and written by a driver thread in case the user's driver code is multi-threaded. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI added regression tests in `SparkContextSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-07-29T04:55:35Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T15:09:06Z","closed_at":"2016-08-02T19:05:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8aa7ac83049868555d8d1b43a40e8d6769ece88c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14396/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14396/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14396/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9aa32b394cd80c776ac567a662c9471351228b93","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-16787","ref":"SPARK-16787","sha":"9aa32b394cd80c776ac567a662c9471351228b93","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What's Been Changed\n\nThe PR corrects several broken or missing class references in the Python API docs. It also correct formatting problems.\n\nFor example, you can see [here](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.0/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.SQLContext.registerFunction) how Sphinx is not picking up the reference to `DataType`. That's because the reference is relative to the current module, whereas `DataType` is in a different module.\n\nYou can also see [here](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.0/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.SQLContext.createDataFrame) how the formatting for byte, tinyint, and so on is italic instead of monospace. That's because in ReST single backticks just make things italic, unlike in Markdown.\n## Testing\n\nI tested this PR by [building the Python docs](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/docs#generating-the-documentation-html) and reviewing the results locally in my browser. I confirmed that the broken or missing class references were resolved, and that the formatting was corrected.\n","created_at":"2016-07-28T16:42:34Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T20:16:09Z","closed_at":"2016-07-28T21:59:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54efb221195ef344bdece7c600a5770a59ba2f71","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14393/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14393/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14393/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/16ef5704f567e5372448d8d4dd2d92ee6133f02e","head":{"label":"nchammas:python-docstring-fixes","ref":"python-docstring-fixes","sha":"16ef5704f567e5372448d8d4dd2d92ee6133f02e","user":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23797421,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc5NzQyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"nchammas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchammas","id":1039369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkzNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas","html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchammas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchammas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch refactors type widening and makes the usage of them in expressions more consistent.\n\nBefore this patch, we have the following 6 functions for type widening (and their usage):\n\n```\nfindTightestCommonTypeOfTwo (binary version)\n- BinaryOperator\n- IfNull\n- NullIf\n- Nvl2\n- JSON schema inference\n\nfindTightestCommonTypeToString (binary version)\n- Nvl\n\nfindTightestCommonTypeAndPromoteToString (n-ary version)\n- CreateArray\n- CreateMap\n\nfindTightestCommonType (n-ary version)\n- Greatest\n- Least\n\nfindWiderTypeForTwo (binary version)\n- IfCoercion\n\nfindWiderCommonType (n-ary version)\n- WidenSetOperationTypes\n- InConversion\n- Coalesce\n- CaseWhenCoercion\n```\n\nAfter this patch, we have only 3 functions for type widening (and their usage):\n\n```\nfindTightestCommonTypeOfTwo (binary version)\n- BinaryOperator\n- JSON schema inference\n\nfindWiderTypeForTwo (binary version)\n- IfCoercion\n- Nvl\n- IfNull\n- NullIf\n- Nvl2\n\nfindWiderCommonType (n-ary version)\n- WidenSetOperationTypes\n- InConversion\n- Coalesce\n- CaseWhenCoercion\n- Greatest\n- Least\n- CreateArray\n- CreateMap\n```\n\nAs a result, this patch changes the type coercion rule for the aforementioned functions so they can accept decimals of different precision/scale. This is not a regression from Spark 1.x, but it is a much bigger problem in Spark 2.0 because floating point literals are parsed as decimals. Queries below would fail in Spark 2.0:\n\n```\nscala> sql(\"select array(0.001, 0.02)\")\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve `array(CAST(0.001 AS DECIMAL(3,3)), CAST(0.02 AS DECIMAL(2,2)))` due to data type mismatch: input to function array should all be the same type, but it's [decimal(3,3), decimal(2,2)]; line 1 pos 7\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCreated a new end-to-end test suite SQLTypeCoercionSuite. In the future we can move all other type checking tests here. I first tried adding a test in SQLQuerySuite but the suite was clearly already too large.\n","created_at":"2016-07-28T07:37:29Z","updated_at":"2016-08-18T04:51:19Z","closed_at":"2016-08-18T04:51:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ffd17346f48715aad09280801bffefd1eb30256b","head":{"label":"petermaxlee:SPARK-16714","ref":"SPARK-16714","sha":"ffd17346f48715aad09280801bffefd1eb30256b","user":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62184923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjE4NDkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"petermaxlee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nVectorized parquet reader now doesn't support complex types such as ArrayType, MapType and StructType. We should support it to extend the coverage of performance improvement introduced by vectorized parquet reader. This patch is to add ArrayType and StructType first.\n### Main changes\n- Obtain repetition and definition level information for Parquet schema\n  \n  In order to support complex types in vectorized Parquet reader, we need to use repetition and definition level information for Parquet schema which are used to encoded the structure of complex types. This PR introduces a class to capture these encoding: `RepetitionDefinitionInfo`. This PR also introduces few classes to capture Parquet schema structure: `ParquetField`, `ParquetStruct`, `ParquetArray` and `ParquetMap`. A new method `getParquetStruct` is added to `ParquetSchemaConverter` which is used to create a `ParquetStruct` object which captures the structure and metadata. The `ParquetStruct` has the same schema structure as the required schema used to guide Parquet reading. It is used to provide the corresponding repetition and definition levels for the fields in the required schema.\n- Attach `VectorizedColumnReader`  to `ColumnVector`\n  \n  Because in flat schema each `ColumnVector` is actually a data column, previously the relation between `VectorizedColumnReader` and `ColumnVector` is one-by-one. Now only the `ColumnVector` representing a data column will have corresponding `VectorizedColumnReader`. Then when it is time to read batch, the `ColumnVector` with complex type will delegate to its child `ColumnVector`.\n- Implement constructing complex records in `VectorizedColumnReader`\n  \n  The `readBatch` in `VectorizedColumnReader` is the main method to read data into `ColumnVector`. Previously its behavior is simply to load required number of data according to the data type of the column vector. Now after the data is loaded into the column, we need to construct complex records in its parent column that could be an ArrayType, MapType or StructType. The way to restore the data as complex types is encoding in repetition and definition levels in Parquet. The new method `constructComplexRecords` in `VectorizedColumnReader` implements the logic to restore the complex data. Basically, what `constructComplexRecords` does is to count the continuous values and add array into the parent column if the repetition level value indicates a new record happens. Besides, `constructComplexRecords` also needs to consider the null values. Null values could mean a null record at root level, an empty array or struct. This method considers different cases and sets it correctly.\n### Benchmark\n\n```\nval N = 10000\nwithParquetTable((0 until N).map { i =>\n  ((i to i + 1000).toList, (i to i +

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe currently don't bound or manage the data array size used by column vectors in the vectorized reader (they're just bound by INT.MAX) which may lead to OOMs while reading data. As a short term fix, this patch intercepts the OutOfMemoryError exception and suggest the user to disable the vectorized parquet reader.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nVersion of derby upgraded based on important security info at VersionEye. Test scope added so we don't include it in our final package anyway. NB: I think this should be backported to all previous releases as it is a security problem https://www.versioneye.com/java/org.apache.derby:derby/10.11.1.1\n\nThe CVE number is 2015-1832. I also suggest we add a SECURITY tag for JIRAs\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests with the change making sure that we see no new failures. I checked derby 10.12.x and not derby 10.11.x is downloaded to our ~/.m2 folder.\n\nI then used dev/make-distribution.sh and checked the dist/jars folder for Spark 2.0: no derby jar is present.\n\nI don't know if this would also remove it from the assembly jar in our 1.x branches.\n","created_at":"2016-07-27T12:53:56Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T13:07:50Z","closed_at":"2016-07-29T11:45:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d04749463ae8fce70f6a72766d87100fdf39cf56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14379/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14379/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14379/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f3815cfd1b6b6d7ba29dc8f2e12b1334ad415847","head":{"label":"a-roberts:patch-4","ref":"patch-4","sha":"f3815cfd1b6b6d7ba29dc8f2e12b1334ad415847","user":{"login":"a-roberts","id":12814972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE0OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12814972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-roberts","html_url":"https://github.com/a-roberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-roberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-roberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-roberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-roberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-roberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-roberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-roberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-roberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a-roberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3c3371bbd6361011b138cce88f6396a2aa4e2cb9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

HashedRelationSuite still pass.\n\nI can confirm the python script I included in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16740 works fine with this patch. Unfortunately I don't have the knowledge/time to write a Scala test case for HashedRelationSuite right now. As the patch is pretty obvious I hope it can be included without

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nA review of the code, working back from Hadoop's `FileSystem.exists()` and `FileSystem.isDirectory()` code, then removing uses of the calls when superfluous.\n1. delete is harmless if called on a nonexistent path, so don't do any checks before deletes\n2. any `FileSystem.exists()`  check before `getFileStatus()` or `open()` is superfluous as the operation itself does the check. Instead the `FileNotFoundException` is caught and triggers the downgraded path. When a `FileNotFoundException` was thrown before, the code still creates a new FNFE with the error messages. Though now the inner exceptions are nested, for easier diagnostics.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nInitially, relying on Jenkins test runs.\n\nOne troublespot here is that some of the codepaths are clearly error situations; it's not clear that they have coverage anyway. Trying to create the failure conditions in tests would be ideal, but it will also be hard.\n","created_at":"2016-07-26T17:51:34Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T18:45:09Z","closed_at":"2016-08-17T18:45:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4903510b4f0ec544e4a36ca2a4ef21af80567ea3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14371/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14371/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14371/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fa8c3bebf31a03686972c5e09ea5b7703c9e81fe","head":{"label":"steveloughran:cloud/SPARK-16736-superfluous-fs-calls","ref":"cloud/SPARK-16736-superfluous-fs-calls","sha":"fa8c3bebf31a03686972c5e09ea5b7703c9e81fe","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIdeally, we would wish codegen methods to be less than 8KB for bytecode size. Beyond 8K JIT won't compile and can cause performance degradation.\n\nInstead of understanding the generated source code and automatically breaking large methods into smaller ones (which is also a little hard to do), it'd be better we discover large methods asap and then manually improve the source code.\n\nThis patch adds support for checking codegen method size on compile. We can specify for each method what is the expected behavior when it exceeds 8KB for bytecode size:\n\n``` scala\n /** No-op when the method exceeds 8K size. */\n case object NO_OP extends FunctionSizeHint\n\n /** Log a warning when the method exceeds 8K size. */\n case object WARN_IF_EXCEEDS_JIT_LIMIT extends FunctionSizeHint\n\n /**\n  * Throw a compilation exception when the method exceeds 8K size.\n  * Fail fast so that we can catch it asap; this is useful in testing corner/edge cases.\n  */\n case object ERROR_IF_EXCEEDS_JIT_LIMIT extends FunctionSizeHint\n```\n\nThis way we can test against some extreme case such as a 10000-columns-wide table, to see if the generated code is small enough to get a chance to be JITed at runtime.\n## Sample Usage\n\n``` scala\n\nval codeBody =\n    s\"\"\"\n      public static void inc() {\n        int i = 0;\n        i++;\n        i++;\n        ... // up to 15000 i++ s here, making this inc() method exceed 8K size\n      }\n    \"\"\"\n\n// == prior to this patch ===================\nctx = new CodegenContext()\nctx.addNewFunction(\"inc\", codeBody)\nCodeGenerator.compile(\n  new CodeAndComment(ctx.declareAddedFunctions(), emptyComments))\n\n// == after this patch ======================\n// Exception: failed to compile. Method org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass.inc\n// should not exceed 8K size limit -- observed size is 45003\nctx = new CodegenContext()\nctx.addNewFunction(\"inc\", codeBody, CodegenContext.ERROR_IF_EXCEEDS_JIT_LIMIT)\nCodeGenerator.compile(\n  new CodeAndComment(ctx.declareAddedFunctions(), emptyComments, ctx.getFuncToSizeHintMap))\n```\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark 1.x supports using the Hive type name as function names for doing casts, e.g.\n\n``` sql\nSELECT int(1.0);\nSELECT string(2.0);\n```\n\nThe above query would work in Spark 1.x because Spark 1.x fail back to Hive for unimplemented functions, and break in Spark 2.0 because the fall back was removed.\n\nThis patch implements function aliases using an analyzer rule for the following cast functions:\n- boolean\n- tinyint\n- smallint\n- int\n- bigint\n- float\n- double\n- decimal\n- date\n- timestamp\n- binary\n- string\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark 1.x supports using the Hive type name as function names for doing casts, e.g.\n\n``` sql\nSELECT int(1.0);\nSELECT string(2.0);\n```\n\nThe above query would work in Spark 1.x because Spark 1.x fail back to Hive for unimplemented functions, and break in Spark 2.0 because the fall back was removed.\n\nThis patch implements function aliases using an analyzer rule for the following cast functions:\n- boolean\n- tinyint\n- smallint\n- int\n- bigint\n- float\n- double\n- decimal\n- date\n- timestamp\n- binary\n- string\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests for SubstituteFunctionAliases as well as end-to-end tests for SQLCompatibilityFunctionSuite.\n","created_at":"2016-07-26T04:53:27Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T04:23:41Z","closed_at":"2016-07-27T04:23:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0bbf348236f24e01610c6ecefaecd431c5608379","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14362/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14362/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14362/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/37b7127cdbf93334daa05dc5f48715b78966d032","head":{"label":"petermaxlee:SPARK-16730","ref":"SPARK-16730","sha":"37b7127cdbf93334daa05dc5f48715b78966d032","user":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62184923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjE4NDkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"petermaxlee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current test is incorrect, because\n- The expected number of messages does not take into account that the topic has 2 partitions, and rate is set per partition. \n- Also in some cases, the test ran out of data in Kafka while waiting for the right amount of data per batch. \n\nThe PR\n- Reduces the number of partitions to 1\n- Adds more data to Kafka\n- Runs with 0.5 second so that batches are created slowly\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan many times locally, going to run it many times in Jenkins\n\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\n","created_at":"2016-07-26T02:38:12Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T18:48:13Z","closed_at":"2016-07-26T07:44:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb062ae5acc67638fac324b9ba37889e6324d68d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14361/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14361/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14361/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/52b5a209eab2b11565e0e9403b35b5eae6429e53","head":{"label":"tdas:kafka-rate-test-fix","ref":"kafka-rate-test-fix","sha":"52b5a209eab2b11565e0e9403b35b5eae6429e53","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

partition.

The fix \n- reduces the partitions to 1,\n- adds more data to Kafka \n- runs with 0.5 second so that batches are created slowly\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nlocally, by running many

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRandomForest currently sends the entire forest to each worker on each iteration. This is because (a) the node queue is FIFO and (b) the closure references the entire array of trees (topNodes). (a) causes RFs to handle splits in many trees, especially early on in learning. (b) sends all trees explicitly.\n\nThis PR:\n(a) Change the RF node queue to be FILO (a stack), so that RFs tend to focus on 1 or a few trees before focusing on others.\n(b) Change topNodes to pass only the trees required on that iteration.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests:\n- Existing tests for correctness of tree learning\n- Manually modifying code and running tests to verify that a small number of trees are communicated on each iteration\n  - This last item is hard to test via unit tests given the current

`array(CAST(0.001 AS DECIMAL(3,3)), CAST(0.02 AS DECIMAL(2,2)))` due to data type mismatch: input to function array should all be the same type, but it's [decimal(3,3), decimal(2,2)]; line 1 pos 7\n```\n\n**After**\n\n``` scala\nscala> sql(\"select array(0.001, 0.02)\")\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [array(0.001, 0.02): array<decimal(3,3)>]\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins tests with a new test case.\n","created_at":"2016-07-25T22:50:03Z","updated_at":"2016-08-14T09:46:18Z","closed_at":"2016-08-01T21:05:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f0b1f7ce8628b9b95ee07297dbc05145e9f172c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14353/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14353/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14353/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a0953891e0d1b80ee8aa2e7d24409f987ba76a83","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-16714","ref":"SPARK-16714","sha":"a0953891e0d1b80ee8aa2e7d24409f987ba76a83","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b14d7b5cf4f173a1e45a4b1ae2a5e4e7ac5e9bb1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is the first step for the following feature:\n\nFor hash aggregation in Spark SQL, we use a fast aggregation hashmap to act as a \"cache\" in order to boost aggregation performance. Previously, the hashmap is backed by a `ColumnarBatch`. This has performance issues when we have wide schema for the aggregation table (large number of key fields or value fields). \nIn this JIRA, we support another implementation of fast hashmap, which is backed by a `RowBasedKeyValueBatch`. We then automatically pick between the two implementations based on certain knobs.\n\nIn this first-step PR, implementations for `RowBasedKeyValueBatch` and `RowBasedHashMapGenerator` are added. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests: `RowBasedKeyValueBatchSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-07-25T20:32:18Z","updated_at":"2017-02-05T04:52:06Z","closed_at":"2016-07-27T01:10:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"93a3e68c55ea86f6615ea82bd09fd1cbd7eed0fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14349/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14349/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14349/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/33978cbc533f4948a77f983f1f3fc1ac75dedeac","head":{"label":"ooq:SPARK-16524","ref":"SPARK-16524","sha":"33978cbc533f4948a77f983f1f3fc1ac75dedeac","user":{"login":"ooq","id":5876435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzY0MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5876435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq","html_url":"https://github.com/ooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44266813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDI2NjgxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ooq/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ooq","id":5876435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzY0MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5876435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq","html_url":"https://github.com/ooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ooq/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt seems this is a regression assuming from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16698.\n\nField name having dots throws an exception. For example the codes below:\n\n``` scala\nval path = \"/tmp/path\"\nval json =\"\"\" {\"a.b\":\"data\"}\"\"\"\nspark.sparkContext\n  .parallelize(json :: Nil)\n  .saveAsTextFile(path)\nspark.read.json(path).collect()\n```\n\nthrows an exception as below:\n\n```\nUnable to resolve a.b given [a.b];\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Unable to resolve a.b given [a.b];\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan$$anonfun$resolve$1$$anonfun$apply$5.apply(LogicalPlan.scala:134)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan$$anonfun$resolve$1$$anonfun$apply$5.apply(LogicalPlan.scala:134)\n    at scala.Option.getOrElse(Option.scala:121)\n```\n\nThis problem was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/17eec0a71ba8713c559d641e3f43a1be726b037c#diff-27c76f96a7b2733ecfd6f46a1716e153R121\n\nWhen extracting the data columns, it does not count that it can contain dots in field names. Actually, it seems the fields name are not expected as quoted. So, It does not have to consider whether this is wrapped with quotes because the actual schema (inferred or user-given schema) would not have the quotes for fields. \n\nFor example, this throws an exception. (**Loading JSON from RDD is fine**)\n\n``` scala\nval json =\"\"\" {\"a.b\":\"data\"}\"\"\"\nval rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(json :: Nil)\nspark.read.schema(StructType(Seq(StructField(\"`a.b`\", StringType, true))))\n  .json(rdd).select(\"`a.b`\").printSchema()\n```\n\nas below:\n\n``````\ncannot resolve '```a.b```' given input columns: [`a.b`];\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '```a.b```' given input columns: [`a.b`];\n    at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe push down `Project` through `Sample` in `Optimizer` by the rule `PushProjectThroughSample`. However, if the projected columns produce new output, they will encounter whole data instead of sampled data. It will bring some inconsistency between original plan (Sample then Project) and optimized plan (Project then Sample). In the extreme case such as attached in the JIRA, if the projected column is an UDF which is supposed to not see the sampled out data, the result of UDF will be incorrect.\n\nSince the rule `ColumnPruning` already handles general `Project` pushdown. We don't need  `PushProjectThroughSample` anymore. The rule `ColumnPruning` also avoids the described issue.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests.\n","created_at":"2016-07-23T10:20:56Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:33:54Z","closed_at":"2016-07-26T04:02:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06fc32518c8dbbd1305b10254f324d3c35c353c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e134f18f5b3fc678d95e2bf10997185ab6dd6e9","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-sample-pushdown","ref":"fix-sample-pushdown","sha":"3e134f18f5b3fc678d95e2bf10997185ab6dd6e9","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror
