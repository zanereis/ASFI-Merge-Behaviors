What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to restore `classifyException()` of `JdbcDialect` before the commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/14a933bbe2eb1c71988f475036735f07b2e1fa6a, and extends `classifyException()` with the error class parameter by `description`:\r\n```scala\r\n  def classifyException(\r\n      e: Throwable,\r\n      errorClass: String,\r\n      messageParameters: Map[String, String],\r\n      description: String): AnalysisException\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `description` parameter has the same meaning as `message` in the old version of `classifyException()` which is deprecated.\r\n\r\nAlso old implementation of `classifyException()` has been restored in JDBC dialects: MySQL, PostgreSQL and so on.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo restore compatibility with existing JDBC dialects.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, this PR restores the behaviour prior https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44358.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *JDBCV2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *JDBCTableCatalogSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixes a correctness bug. The TIMESTAMP_NTZ is a new data type in Spark and has no legacy files that need to do calendar rebase. However, the vectorized parquet reader treat it the same as LTZ and may do rebase if the parquet file was written with the legacy rebase mode. This PR fixes it to never do rebase for NTZ.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44310 . It turns out that `TreeNodeTag` in `Project` is way too fragile. `Project` is a very basic node and very easy to get removed/transformed during plan optimization.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches to a different approach: since we can't retain the information (input data order doesn't matter) from `Aggregate`, let's leverage this information immediately. We pull out the expensive part of `EliminateSorts` to a new rule, so that we can safely call `EliminateSorts` right before we turn `Aggregate` into `Project`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nto make the optimizer more robust.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixes a correctness bug. The TIMESTAMP_NTZ is a new data type in Spark and has no legacy files that need to do calendar rebase. However, the vectorized parquet reader treat it the same as LTZ and may do rebase if the parquet file was written with the legacy rebase mode. This PR fixes it to never do rebase for NTZ.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe `_stopTimeout` sets a graceful stop time for each ContainerLifeCycle.\r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to address the issue of interrupting shutdown hooks during the shutdown process. By setting the _stopTimeout to 5 seconds, we can reduce the risk of causing modules such as MapOutputTracker and BlockManager in the SparkContext to not be properly stopped, resulting in uncleaned resources.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/blob/1f34ece62b918a006231258474f5fa370c49df29/jetty-util/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/component/AbstractLifeCycle.java#L53\r\n```\r\nprivate long _stopTimeout = 30000;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pull request reduces the value to 5 seconds, taking into account the value from the [QueuedThreadPool](https://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.project.git/tree/jetty-util/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/thread/QueuedThreadPool.java#n96)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn Jetty, the ContainerLifeCycle implementation manages a collection of contained beans. For managed beans, it stops them one by one and waits for each to stop for a specified time(30s). A single bean can result in the shutdown hook timeout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced easily by local-cluster with proxied SparkUI. \r\n\r\n#### Before

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nInlineTable column can also be nullable when there is type conversion to Decimal and it is not safe to be converted to null. So this PR updates the column nullability to true when there is type conversion to Decimal and the conversion is safe to make the new type null.\r\n\r\nNote that given current implementation for conversion to Decimal, it is not likely null will happen, however because `canNullSafeCastToDecimal` still could return false so we need a defensive check for that case. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to make the nullability behavior consistent after type conversion in InlineTable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSubqueries with correlation under LIMIT with OFFSET have a correctness bug, introduced recently when support for correlation under OFFSET was enabled but were not handled correctly. (So we went from unsupported, query throws error -> wrong results.) This is in master branch, not yet released.\r\n\r\nThis PR first disables correlated OFFSET by adding a feature flag for it, which is disabled. Next PR will add support for it and re-enable it. This PR also adds a feature flag for the related LIMIT support (which is enabled).\r\n\r\nIt’s a bug in all types of correlated subqueries: scalar, lateral, IN, EXISTS\r\n\r\nExample repro:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table x(x1 int, x2 int);\r\ninsert into x values (1, 1), (2, 2);\r\ncreate table y(y1 int, y2 int);\r\ninsert into y values (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4);\r\n\r\nselect * from x where exists (select * from y where x1 = y1 limit 1 offset 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCorrect result: empty set\r\nSpark result: Array([2,2])\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCorrectness bug\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nDisables correlated OFFSET query shape which was not handled correctly.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fix a but by make JDBC dialect decide the decimal precision and scale.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce the bug?**\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44397 proposed DS V2 push down `PERCENTILE_CONT` and `PERCENTILE_DISC`.\r\nThe bug fired when pushdown the below SQL to H2 JDBC.\r\n`SELECT \"DEPT\",PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY \"SALARY\" ASC NULLS FIRST) FROM \"test\".\"employee\" WHERE 1=0 GROUP BY \"DEPT\"`\r\n\r\n**The root cause**\r\n`getQueryOutputSchema` used to get the output schema of query by call `JdbcUtils.getSchema`.\r\nThe query for database H2 show below.\r\n`SELECT \"DEPT\",PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY \"SALARY\" ASC NULLS FIRST) FROM \"test\".\"employee\" WHERE 1=0 GROUP BY \"DEPT\"`\r\nWe can get the five variables from `ResultSetMetaData`, please refer:\r\n```\r\ncolumnName = \"PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY SALARY NULLS FIRST)\"\r\ndataType = 2\r\ntypeName = \"NUMERIC\"\r\nfieldSize = 100000\r\nfieldScale = 50000\r\n```\r\nThen we get the catalyst schema with `JdbcUtils.getCatalystType`, it calls `DecimalType.bounded(precision, scale)` actually.\r\nThe `DecimalType.bounded(100000, 50000)` returns `DecimalType(38, 38)`.\r\nAt finally, `makeGetter` throws exception.\r\n```\r\nCaused by:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR will translate the aggregate function `PERCENTILE_CONT` and `PERCENTILE_DISC` for pushdown.\r\n\r\n- This PR adds `Expression[] orderingWithinGroups` into `GeneralAggregateFunc`, so as DS V2 pushdown framework could compile the `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)` easily.\r\n\r\n- This PR also split `visitInverseDistributionFunction` from `visitAggregateFunction`, so as DS V2 pushdown framework could generate the syntax `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)` easily.\r\n\r\n- This PR also fix a bug that `JdbcUtils` can't treat the precision and scale of decimal returned from JDBC.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDS V2 supports push down `PERCENTILE_CONT` and `PERCENTILE_DISC`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Remove a bunch of Liquid directives that are not necessary.\r\n- Add a table of contents to the built-in SQL functions page.\r\n- Move the generated HTML for built-in SQL functions to a subdirectory.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo reduce confusion for maintainers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to set all rebase related SQL configs to the `CORRECTED` mode by default. Here are the affected configs:\r\n- spark.sql.parquet.int96RebaseModeInWrite\r\n- spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\r\n- spark.sql.parquet.int96RebaseModeInRead\r\n- spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead\r\n- spark.sql.avro.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\r\n- spark.sql.avro.datetimeRebaseModeInRead\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe configs were set to the `EXCEPTION` mode to give users a choice to select proper mode for compatibility with old Spark versions <= 2.4.5. Those versions are not able to detect the rebase mode from meta information in parquet and avro files. Since the versions are out of broad usage, Spark starting from the version 4.0.0 will write/ read ancient datatime without rebasing and any exceptions. This should be more convenient for users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it can if user's code expects an exception while reading/writing ancient datetimes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetRebaseDatetimeV1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetRebaseDatetimeV2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *RebaseDateTimeSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV1Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV2Suite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-17T16:33:12Z","updated_at":"2023-12-21T07:52:18Z","closed_at":"2023-12-18T08:41:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"822b6df2af6e5faf13fc80d4fbd162d6756a54dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc694cfc795714755edc007204553c0deba31669","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:set-rebase-conf-corrected","ref":"set-rebase-conf-corrected","sha":"bc694cfc795714755edc007204553c0deba31669","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a perf regression in CREATE TABLE if we switch to the v2 command framework, as `V2SessionCatalog#createTable` does an extra table lookup, which does not happen in v1. This PR fixes it by allowing `TableCatalog#createTable` to return null, and Spark will call `loadTable` to get the new table metadata in the case of CTAS. This PR also fixed `alterTable` in the same way.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix perf regression in v2. The perf of a single command may not matter, but in a cluster with many Spark applications, it's important to reduce the RPCs to the metastore.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support Python metrics in Python Data Source so the metrics are reported same as other Python execution and API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSame metics (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33559) should be shown in Python Data Source reading. This is last missing part compared to other Python execution and API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nPython Data Source has not been released yet, so no end-user facing change.\r\nIt shows some new metrics in UI.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.datasource import DataSource, DataSourceReader, InputPartition\r\n\r\nclass TestDataSourceReader(DataSourceReader):\r\n    def __init__(self, options):\r\n        self.options = options\r\n    def partitions(self):\r\n        return [InputPartition(i) for i in range(3)]\r\n    def read(self, partition):\r\n        yield partition.value, str(partition.value)\r\n\r\nclass TestDataSource(DataSource):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def name(cls):\r\n        return \"test\"\r\n    def schema(self):\r\n        return \"x INT, y STRING\"\r\n    def reader(self, schema) -> \"DataSourceReader\":\r\n        return TestDataSourceReader(self.options)\r\n\r\n\r\nspark.dataSource.register(TestDataSource)\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE tblA USING test\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT * from tblA\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"515\"

etc.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added, and manually tested via UI.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a kind of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44305 that proposes to create Python Data Source instance at `DataSource.lookupDataSourceV2`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSemantically the instance has to be ready at `DataSource.lookupDataSourceV2` level instead of after that. It's more consistent as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds the following conversions to the vectorized and non-vectorized Parquet readers corresponding to type promotions that are strictly widening without precision loss:\r\n- Int -> Long\r\n- Float -> Double\r\n- Int -> Double\r\n- Date -> TimestampNTZ (Timestamp without timezone only as a date has no timezone information)\r\n- Decimal with higher precision (already supported in non-vectorized reader)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese type promotions support two similar use cases:\r\n1. Reading a set of Parquet files with different types, e.g a mix of Int and Long for a given column. If the read schema is Long, the reader should be able to read all files and promote Ints to Longs instead of failing.\r\n2. Widening the type of a column in a table that already contains Parquet files, e.g. an Int column isn't large enough to accommodate IDs and is changed to Long. Existing Parquet files storing the value as Int should still be correctly read by upcasting values.\r\n\r\nThe second use case in particular will enable widening the type of columns or fields in existing Delta tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe following fails before this change:\r\n```\r\nSeq(0).toDF(\"a\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a LONG\").parquet(path).where(s\"a < ${Long.MaxValue}\").collect()\r\n```\r\nWith the Int->Long promotion in both the vectorized and non-vectorized parquet readers, it succeeds and produces correct results, without overflow or loss of precision.\r\nThe same is true for Float->Double, Int->Double, Decimal with higher precision and Date->TimestampNTZ\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added `ParquetTypeWideningSuite` covering the promotions included in this change, in particular:\r\n  - Non-dictionary encoded values / dictionary encoded values for each promotion\r\n  - Timestamp rebase modes `LEGACY` and `CORRECTED` for Date -> TimestampNTZ\r\n  - Promotions between decimal types with different physical storage: `INT32`, `INT64`, `BINARY`, `FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY`\r\n  - Reading values written with Parquet V1 and V2 writers.\r\n- Updated/Removed two tests that expect type promotion to fail.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen comparing two UDT values in interpreted mode, treat each value as an instance of the UDT's underlying type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nConsider the following code:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.{DenseVector, Vector}\r\n\r\nval df = Seq.tabulate(30) { x =>\r\n  (x, x + 1, x + 2, new DenseVector(Array((x/100.0).toDouble, ((x + 1)/100.0).toDouble, ((x + 3)/100.0).toDouble)))\r\n}.toDF(\"id\", \"c1\", \"c2\", \"c3\")\r\n\r\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"df\")\r\n\r\n// this works\r\nsql(\"select * from df order by c3\").collect\r\n\r\nsql(\"set spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false\")\r\nsql(\"set spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=NO_CODEGEN\")\r\n\r\n// this gets an error\r\nsql(\"select * from df order by c3\").collect\r\n```\r\nThe first collect action works. However, the second collect action, which runs in interpreted mode, gets the following exception:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkIllegalArgumentException: Type UninitializedPhysicalType does not support ordered operations.\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.orderedOperationUnsupportedByDataTypeError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:348)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.types.UninitializedPhysicalType$.ordering(PhysicalDataType.scala:332)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.types.UninitializedPhysicalType$.ordering(PhysicalDataType.scala:329)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.InterpretedOrdering.compare(ordering.scala:60)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.InterpretedOrdering.compare(ordering.scala:39)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.UnsafeExternalRowSorter$RowComparator.compare(UnsafeExternalRowSorter.java:254)\r\n```\r\nThe code generator creates code that compares UDTs based on their underlying type. See [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c045a425bf0c472f164e3ef75a8a2c68d72d61d3/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/codegen/CodeGenerator.scala#L721).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the interpreted mode code tries to compare the values as UDTs, not as their underlying types. This PR brings interpreted mode code in line with the generated code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-14T21:11:43Z","updated_at":"2023-12-22T18:27:11Z","closed_at":"2023-12-18T19:55:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9dae45c1f3cd15e9f95ebb39c1b5b5759baf0bba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44361/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44361/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44361/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3d7668057004766f6ab900605ce1d5d35b6730da","head":{"label":"bersprockets:udt_order_issue","ref":"udt_order_issue","sha":"3d7668057004766f6ab900605ce1d5d35b6730da","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to raise exceptions with only error classes from `JdbcUtils.classifyException`, and introduce new error class `FAILED_JDBC` with sub-classes linked to a particular JDBC operation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL by migrating on new error framework when all Spark exceptions from the JDBC datasource have an error class.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if user's code depends on exceptions from the JDBC datasource.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *JDBCV2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *JDBCTableCatalogSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt
