What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `angular/cli` dependency of all angular applications have been upgraded to `14.2.9`. Since the projects have been on `1.7.4` (except webshell-ui),  other dependencies, files, configs and some code needed to be changed too.\r\nMain changes:\r\n- changed `TSLint` to `ESLint`\r\n- switched `angular-cli.json` to `angular.json`\r\n- some files were not linted, they are now linted and formatted\r\n- `sweetalert` is changed to `sweetalert2`\r\n- nodejs version is now `v14.15.0`\r\n- commented out xml parsing of shared providers in `resource-detail.component`\r\n- the div that hosts the topology `ace-editor` is now hidden (it was not generated before) until it is needed, so that \r\nit's `ViewChild` can be set.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested the features:\r\n\r\nToken-management:\r\n- generated normal token\r\n- generated impersonated token\r\n- disabled impersonation\r\n- set server-managed to false\r\n- disabled and revoked the created tokens\r\n\r\nToken-generation:\r\n- set server-managed to true and false\r\n- set impersonation to true and false\r\n- set lifespan.input.enabled to true and false\r\n- tried to generate token over the max lifespan limit\r\n- generated tokens until reached token limit\r\n- authenticated with a generated token\r\n\r\nHomepage:\r\n- Tried the links\r\n- Mouse on service name -> description shows up\r\n- When UI services are clicked they navigate to UI URL\r\n- When API services are clicked description shows up\r\n- Dropdown menus open and close\r\n- New topologies appear under the topologies menu \r\n\r\nAdmin-ui:\r\n- Created, deleted, modified service

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith this change, the previously added ProxyUser configuration for KnoxToken impersonation is removed because the same can be achieved with the appropriate identity assertion configuration.\r\n\r\nAnother very important change is that Knox's HadoopAuth filter no longer sets the 'doAs' user as the primary principal. Instead, it's passed down as an ImpersonatedPrincipal and the original user (real user) remains the PrimaryPrincipal in the underlying security context (Subject).\r\n\r\nThe new-type impersonation support on the identity assertion layer is ignored if the topology uses the `HadoopAuth` authentication provider as the `doAs` support there is working OOTB so that a second authorization is useless going forward.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit test cases and updated existing ones.\r\n\r\nManual test cases were executed on the token generation page using the demo LDAP server and Knox's SSOCookieProvider which is backed up by the usual ShiroProvider with `org.apache.knox.gateway.shirorealm.KnoxLdapRealm`:\r\n\r\n1. Impersonation thru ProxyUser config is disabled and user mapping is not configured\r\n  - logged in as the 'admin' user\r\n  - generated a token without the doAs param: userName=admin; createdBy was not added\r\n  - generated a token with the doAs=bob param: userName=admin; createdBy was not added\r\n\r\n2. Impersonation thru ProxyUser config is enabled and user mapping is not configured\r\n  - proxyuser config was set to: hadoop.proxyuser.admin.[users|groups|hosts] = *\r\n  - logged in as the 'admin' user\r\n  - generated a token without the doAs param: userName=admin; createdBy was not added\r\n  - generated a token with the doAs=bob param: userName=bob; createdBy=admin\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1 tested a negative case too: removed hadoop.proxyuser.admin.[users|groups|hosts] = *\r\n  - logged in as the 'admin' user\r\n  - generated a token without the doAs param: userName=admin; createdBy was not added\r\n  - generated a token with the doAs=bob param: token creation failed (User: admin is not allowed to impersonate bob)\r\n\r\n3. Impersonation thru ProxyUser config is disabled and user mapping is configured\r\n- user mapping was set to: principal.mapping = admin=sam\r\n- logged in the 'admin' user\r\n- generated a token without the doAs param: userName=sam; createdBy=admin\r\n- generated a token with the doAs=bob param: userName=sam; createdBy=admin\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Impersonation thru ProxyUser config is enabled and user mapping is configured\r\n- proxyuser config was set to: hadoop.proxyuser.admin.[users|groups|hosts] = *\r\n- user mapping was set to: principal.mapping = admin=sam\r\n- logged in the 'admin' user\r\n- generated a token without the doAs param: userName=sam; createdBy=admin\r\n- generated a token with the doAs=bob param: userName=bob; createdBy=admin\r\n\r\n4.1 re-configured user mapping to: principal.mapping = bob=tom\r\n- did not touch the proxyuser config\r\n- logged in the 'admin' user\r\n- generated a token without the doAs param: userName=admin; createdBy was not added\r\n- generated a token with the doAs=bob param: userName=tom; createdBy=admin\r\n\r\nI also tested the same scenarios within a secure (Kerberized) cluster with Knox's `HadoopAuth` filter as well as using `PAM` authentication.","created_at":"2022-11-23T10:47:33Z","updated_at":"2022-12-22T19:15:46Z","closed_at":"2022-12-22T19:15:32Z","merged_at":"2022-12-22T19:15:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"6a4d5dfb4cca531a3adda0e6330cc806d0192249","assignee":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1870962954,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODcwOTYyOTU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/knoxtoken","name":"knoxtoken","color":"a88be8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4835703519,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQgj3s8AAAABIDr63w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/identity-assertion","name":"identity-assertion","color":"7D8225","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/db9ca8892d20394e8c0fa5d941f887425301cdae","head":{"label":"smolnar82:KNOX-2839","ref":"KNOX-2839","sha":"db9ca8892d20394e8c0fa5d941f887425301cdae","user":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":168984130,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjg5ODQxMzA=","name":"knox","full_name":"smolnar82/knox","private":false,"owner":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[KNOX-2835](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KNOX-2835) introduced an unwanted side effect after enabling the SQL based topology monitor.\r\n\r\nThe intent of  synchronization which was added in KNOX-2835 is:\r\n * If a descriptor/provider was deleted from the DB the monitor should delete the descriptor/provider from the local file system\r\n \r\nBut what really happens, implementation wise is that:\r\n\r\n* If a descriptor/provider exists on the file system but doesn't exist in the DB the topology monitor is going to delete it.\r\n\r\nThese two are not exactly the same. If a user creates a descriptor/provider on the file system, it will be deleted by the topology monitor even though it never existed in the DB. The Zookeeper implementation uses onDeleteEvents which are only triggered when something was previously added but later it was deleted. But the SQL based topology uses polling.\r\n\r\nSo if one enable this feature with an empty DB, all of the descriptors/providers are going to be deleted.\r\n\r\nTo address this issue, this patch introduces logical deletes. Deleting a descriptor/provider only sets the delete=true column in the DB. The monitor only deletes a local file if a corresponding record exists in the DB and the delete column is set to true. If something never existed in the DB it'll never be deleted.\r\n\r\nThe logically deleted records are eventually cleared up to.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<property>\r\n    <name>gateway.service.remoteconfigurationmonitor.impl</name>\r\n    <value>org.apache.knox.gateway.topology.monitor.db.DbRemoteConfigurationMonitorService</value>\r\n</property>\r\n<property>\r\n    <name>gateway.database.type</name>\r\n    <value>mysql</value>\r\n</property>\r\n<property>\r\n    <name>gateway.database.connection.url</name>\r\n    <value>jdbc:mysql://root:root@localhost:3306/knox</value>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested manually with 3 instances of knox. I created a custom descriptor + provider via the admin UI and checked the file content on each host. I deleted a descriptor/provider and checked if the file disappeared from the hosts. I checked the DB content to see the delete=true flag. I waited until the record was physically deleted. \r\nI checked that existing topologies were not effected by the deletes.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-17T15:39:18Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T09:16:20Z","closed_at":"2022-11-29T09:16:20Z","merged_at":"2022-11-29T09:16:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"616a4e06e8c24c6ba65250d4f853851d6a7d81b9","assignee":{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pzampino","id":13018719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE4NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13018719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino","html_url":"https://github.com/pzampino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/ecb171fa724fca53bcd6deeb3c0b8d414f3395f7","head":{"label":"zeroflag:KNOX-2844-ex","ref":"KNOX-2844-ex","sha":"ecb171fa724fca53bcd6deeb3c0b8d414f3395f7","user":{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a similar implementation as the existing zookeeper based monitor, but it uses the SQL DB. Zookeeper is not always available and the DB is already used by the token state service.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this monitor is to periodically check the DB for shared-providers and descriptors and update the local file system with the changes from the DB.\r\n\r\n1. If a provider/descriptor is deleted from the db but exists on the file system the monitor is going to delete it from the file system\r\n2. If a provider/descriptor exists in the DB but missing from the file system the monitor is going to download it from the DB to the FS.\r\n3. If a provider/descriptor in the DB has a different content than the corresponding local file, then the monitor is going to update the local file with the content from he DB. However to avoid too frequent and unnecessary IO operations we only change the local files if the remote change happened after the last synchronization time (if it happened in the past, we assume the changes were already synced to the disk). So  One can change the local files on the disk without worrying about losing their local changes (until someone updates the DB).\r\n\r\nThe provider logic is implementeed in DbRemoteConfigurationMonitor.\r\n\r\nThe original DefaultRemoteConfigurationMonitor was renamed to ZkRemoteConfigurationMonitor.\r\n\r\nSince the original zookeeper based monitor was already hooked in the Admin UI and Admin API, the new implementation also supports both the UI + API.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ngateway-site.xml\r\n\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe DoS security provider have been removed, and it's functionality have been moved in the Web App Security provider.\r\nThis provider is now able to add a Jetty DoSFilter into to filterchain if configured.\r\nThe configuration options are the same as jetty's DoSFilter and can be found in jetty's DoSFilter documentation (https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/jetty-9/index.html#dos-filter), EXCEPT that the parameters need a `rate.limiting.` prefix AND when using delayMs with 0 or higher value or using throttling the `gateway.servlet.async.supported` configuration must be set to `true` in `gateway-site.xml` configuration file (it defaults to false)!\r\nExample configuration:\r\n```\r\n<provider>\r\n         <role>webappsec</role>\r\n         <name>WebAppSec</name>\r\n         <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n<param>\r\n         <name>rate.limiting.enabled</name>\r\n         <value>true</value>\r\n</param>\r\n<param>\r\n         <name>rate.limiting.maxRequestsPerSec</name>\r\n         <value>2</value>\r\n</param>\r\n<param>\r\n         <name>rate.limiting.delayMs</name>\r\n         <value>2000</value>\r\n</param>\r\n<param>\r\n         <name>rate.limiting.maxWaitMs</name>\r\n         <value>20000</value>\r\n</param>\r\n<param>\r\n         <name>rate.limiting.throttledRequests</name>\r\n         <value>3</value>\r\n</param>\r\n<param>\r\n         <name>rate.limiting.throttleMs</name>\r\n         <value>20000</value>\r\n</param>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have written tests into the `WebAppSecContributorTest` class.\r\nThese tests test whether the contributor sets the right filters and parameters or not.\r\n\r\nI have also tested the feature manually by sending 10 curl requests to a server which response time is 3 seconds and enabled DEBUG level logs for `org.eclipse.jetty.servlets`.\r\n\r\nWhen the feature is disabled:\r\n```\r\n<param>\r\n         <name>rate.limiting.enabled</name>\r\n         <value>false</value>\r\n</param>\r\n```\r\nThere is no effect:\r\n```\r\n2022-11-03 09:58:24,806 2ca3f959-da98-414a-81a3-fe8c9d053ba6 INFO  knox.gateway (KnoxLdapRealm.java:getUserDn(688)) - Computed userDn: uid=tom,ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrior to my changes, both Knox's `HadoopAuthFilter` and `TokenResource` classes used Hadoop's `ProxyUsers` class that maintains a static `ImpersonationProvider` instance and invokes delegation methods on that. Subsequent `ProxyUsers.refreshSuperUserGroupsConfiguration` calls overwrite this impersonation provider. This causes a problem in the following cases:\r\n- end-users have multiple Knox topologies where token impersonation enabled with different proxyuser configurations in the `KNOXTOKEN` service\r\n- even in the same topology if the authentication method is Kerberos (thus we have the `HadoopAuth` filter enabled and configured) and the `KNOXTOKEN` service with impersonation enabled with another proxuyser configuration\r\n\r\nThe solution is to eliminate the need for this static `ProxyUsers` factory and have the `ImpersonationProvider` instances created and stored in a map on topology/role level.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAfter deploying Knox with y changes, I duplicated the the `homepage` topology and re-configured the proxyuser settings:\r\n- homepage.xml - `admin` can impersonate anyone\r\n```\r\n      <param>\r\n          <name>knox.token.impersonation.enabled</name>\r\n          <value>true</value>\r\n      </param>\r\n      <param>\r\n          <name>knox.token.proxyuser.admin.users</name>\r\n          <value>*</value>\r\n      </param>\r\n      <param>\r\n          <name>knox.token.proxyuser.admin.groups</name>\r\n          <value>*</value>\r\n      </param>\r\n      <param>\r\n          <name>knox.token.proxyuser.admin.hosts</name>\r\n          <value>*</value>\r\n      </param>\r\n```\r\n- homepage_2.xml - `guest` can impersonate anyone\r\n```\r\n      <param>\r\n          <name>knox.token.impersonation.enabled</name>\r\n          <value>true</value>\r\n      </param>\r\n      <param>\r\n          <name>knox.token.proxyuser.guest.users</name>\r\n          <value>*</value>\r\n      </param>\r\n      <param>\r\n          <name>knox.token.proxyuser.guest.groups</name>\r\n          <value>*</value>\r\n      </param>\r\n      <param>\r\n          <name>knox.token.proxyuser.guest.hosts</name>\r\n          <value>*</value>\r\n      </param>\r\n```\r\nThen I generated impersonated tokens for`user1` and `user2` on behalf of the `admin` user using the `homepage` topology and on behalf of the `guest` user using the `homepage_2` topology. All tokens were generated successfully (as opposed to what I experienced before my changes; see the [KNOX-2831](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KNOX-2831)):\r\n```\r\npostgres=> select * from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn some cases  getPID will return 0 even if the process started. e.g. pid file is deleted or file is modified and we can not get \r\ncorrect pid from the file.  So I add a new function getPidByCommand. It will give the correct pid (APP_GATEWAY_PID ) if process is started. And we'll check the process whether it is started according to APP_PID obtained from pid file ,if it return false ,use APP_GATEWAY_PID  . set APP_PID=$APP_GATEWAY_PID.In this way,we can get correct messagge whether the gateway or ldap process is started\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n1.  start gateway or ldap process \r\n2.  delete pid file or modify the content in file\r\n3.  execute gateway.sh status or ldap.sh status . It will return correct message \r\n \r\n\r\nPlease review [Knox Contributing Process](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KNOX/Contribution+Process#ContributionProcess-GithubWorkflow) before

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA new maven module was added which contains the angular version of the javascript token generation web application.\r\nThe angular version works just like the old javascript site only a couple of improvements were added:\r\n-Invalid error message when form is invalid is now instantaneous (before you would have to press the generate button)\r\n-When form is invalid the generation button is now disabled\r\n-When token state service status request data prohibits token generation on the site, now the generation request is not sent even if the generation button is enabled through developer settings\r\n-X-XSRF-Header header is added now with the requests\r\n-Now there is no error message when lifespan input is disabled and maximum token ttl is under 1 hour to ask the user whether he wants to change the lifespan even though it is not possible\r\n-Now theres a pop up error when token generation fails\r\n-Now when lifespan input is disabled you can not enable it in the developer settings and adjust it and send a request with the adjusted lifespan\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGenerated a token with the new site and used it in a curl request:\r\n```\r\ncurl -ku

https://localhost:8443/gateway/test/hive\r\n```\r\nI tested the feature manually by comparing the old and new site with different configurations:\r\nDeleted `knox.token.ttl` configuration or set it to `-6` -> default 30 second maximum lifetime showed up\r\nChanged `knox.token.target.url` -> changed valued showed up\r\nChanged `knox.token.client.data` -> changed value showed up\r\nSet `knox.token.exp.server-managed` to `true` -> token generation is enabled\r\nSet `knox.token.exp.server-managed` to `false` -> token generation is disabled and error message is shown\r\nSet `knox.token.lifespan.input.enabled` to `true` -> lifespan input fields are shown and used in the request \r\nSet `knox.token.lifespan.input.enabled` to `false` -> lifespan input fields are not shown and not used in the request\r\nSet token state service implementation in `gateway-site.xml` -> Backend initialization failed error message.\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n      <name>gateway.service.tokenstate.impl</name>\r\n      <value>org.apache.knox.gateway.services.token.impl.DefaultTokenStateService</value>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\nMade the form invalid by changing all three lifespan input numbers to 0, deleted one of the numbers, made one of the numbers smaller then the minimum and higher then the maximum limit, made one of the numbers a rational number.","created_at":"2022-10-21T14:05:08Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T08:50:12Z","closed_at":"2022-11-03T08:50:12Z","merged_at":"2022-11-03T08:50:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"a2a8adc3bc7c1aced84347ff181f62b4486d9d37","assignee":{"login":"MrtnBalazs","id":77810082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODEwMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77810082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs","html_url":"https://github.com/MrtnBalazs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MrtnBalazs","id":77810082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODEwMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77810082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs","html_url":"https://github.com/MrtnBalazs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrtnBalazs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1870962954,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODcwOTYyOTU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/knoxtoken","name":"knoxtoken","color":"a88be8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/656/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/656/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/656/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/51b6c4f7e8dc0847e1414c9bcbe3b27533697e52","head":{"label":"MrtnBalazs:KNOX-2811","ref":"KNOX-2811","sha":"51b6c4f7e8dc0847e1414c9bcbe3b27533697e52","user":{"login":"MrtnBalazs","id":77810082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODEwMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7781

All browsers that Angular supports work with ES2015+</li>\n<li>Deprecated support for Stylus has been removed. The Stylus package has never reached a stable version and its usage in the Angular CLI is minimal. It's recommended to migrate to another CSS preprocessor that the Angular CLI supports.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><code>@​angular-devkit/core</code></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Workspace projects with missing <code>root</code> is now an error.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><code>@​schematics/angular</code></h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Commit</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/1c21e470c76d69d08e5096b46b952dbce330f7ef\">1c21e470c</a></td>\n<td>feat</td>\n<td>enable error on unknown properties and elements in tests</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><code>@​angular-devkit/build-angular</code></h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Commit</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/1c527a9da5b55a8421ebca787fd322e879f6d29d\">1c527a9da</a></td>\n<td>feat</td>\n<td>add esbuild-based builder initial support for fileReplacements</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/15d3fc6dc3f74462818b3745f6fb4995212a4d22\">15d3fc6dc</a></td>\n<td>feat</td>\n<td>export <code>@angular/platform-server</code> symbols in server bundle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/1e5d4a75084dfd2aeebb6a0c0b3039417e14bc84\">1e5d4a750</a></td>\n<td>feat</td>\n<td>use Browserslist to determine ECMA output</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/12931ba8c3772b1dd65846cbd6146804b08eab31\">12931ba8c</a></td>\n<td>refactor</td>\n<td>remove deprecated ES5 support</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/commit/2ba44a433c827413a53d12de0ef203f8988ddc2a\">2ba44a433</a></td>\n<td>refactor</td>\n<td>remove support for Stylus</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><code>@​angular-devkit/core</code></h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Commit</th>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n</table>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `btoa` (third party) javascript functions can't base64 encode some of the special characters such as the letter `ë`. \r\nWe use this function to create the basic authorization header. If user's password contains an unsupported character the login will fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested the new function manually:\r\n\r\n```\r\nunicodeBase64Encode('árvíztűrő tükörfúrógép ë !#$%^&*()_!#@V')\r\n'w6FydsOtenTFsXLFkSB0w7xrw7ZyZsO6csOzZ8OpcCDDqyAhIyQlXiYqKClfISNAVg=='\r\n\r\nunicodeBase64Encode('阪熊奈岡鹿梨阜埼茨栃')\r\n'6Ziq54aK5aWI5bKh6bm/5qKo6Zic5Z+86Iyo5qCD'\r\n阪熊奈岡鹿梨阜埼茨栃\r\n```\r\nThe I decoded the result and I got back the original string.\r\n\r\nThe I changed sam's password in users.ldif:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# entry for sample user sam\r\ndn: uid=sam,ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\nobjectclass:top\r\nobjectclass:person\r\nobjectclass:organizationalPerson\r\nobjectclass:inetOrgPerson\r\ncn: sam\r\nsn: sam\r\nuid: sam\r\nuserPassword: 阪熊奈岡鹿梨阜埼茨栃 árvíztűrő tükörfúrógép ë !#$%^&*()_!#@V\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the demo ldap server could not parse this password because it calls `Strings.toLowerCaseAscii(line)` on each line of the ldif file.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n@risdenk use `org.apache.knox.gateway.dispatch.URLDecodingDispatch` for HDFSUI dispatch ha-class  in https://github.com/apache/knox/pull/103. But `URLDecodingDispatch` didn't do failover request when request failed. \r\n\r\nI recommend using `org.apache.knox.gateway.hdfs.dispatch.HdfsUIHaDispatch` for this, but it  it lack URL decoding what  `URLDecodingDispatch` do. So I override `getDispatchUrl` method in `HdfsUIHaDispatch`, decode url just like `URLDecodingDispatch`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- mvn clean verify -Ppackage,release\r\n- Checked that HDFSUI service definition works with HaProvider on cluster\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26102745/192078471-4927720c-42e0-45e2-96d1-cb36f0ef7d8a.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-24T03:38:53Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T00:40:38Z","closed_at":"2023-05-03T00:40:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3811fb536ef5ff3784735bde6fd9322d1cfdda76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"lmccay","id":2303672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDM2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2303672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay","html_url":"https://github.com/lmccay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmccay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pzampino","id":13018719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE4NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13018719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino","html_url":"https://github.com/pzampino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"risdenk","id":3384157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODQxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3384157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/risdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/risdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/7155a8f77b05afefba131ee0e973ea21cf3abcb1","head":{"label":"Flamingo93:hdfsui-ha","ref":"hdfsui-ha","sha":"7155a8f77b05afefba131ee0e973ea21cf3abcb1","user":{"login":"Flamingo93","id":26102745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTAyNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26102745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Flamingo93","html_url":"https://github.com/Flamingo93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nKnox's automated service discovery had a bug when it came to HIVE(_ON_TEZ) service discovery. These services have their SSL-enabled flag on the service level, but the generated service model (by Knox) stored that information in the HS2 role configs.\r\nIn addition to this, the CM configuration name referred to the so-called `related name` configuration field which Knox does not consider when comparing previous and current service/role configs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated JUnit tests and executed manual testing in a cluster with KNOX, HIVE and HIVE_ON_TEZ.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-23T09:12:26Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T06:58:25Z","closed_at":"2022-09-26T06:58:21Z","merged_at":"2022-09-26T06:58:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"7496c39dc72d7eba4643d7167eab1aafafc9685d","assignee":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1791109578,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzkxMTA5NTc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/ClouderaManager","name":"ClouderaManager","color":"3bf7bb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2003085668,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDAzMDg1NjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/service-discovery","name":"service-discovery","color":"a52234","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/636/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/636/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/636/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/87088c0858809caaa1a2629286dfff6daec3f53e","head":{"label":"smolnar82:KNOX-2807"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA new module called: `gateway-provider-security-dos` was added. It adds jetty's `DoSFilter` to the topology when configured in the topology file. The configuration options are the same as jetty's DoSFilter and can be found in jetty's DoSFilter documentation (https://archive.eclipse.org/jetty/9.0.0.RC0/apidocs/org/eclipse/jetty/servlets/DoSFilter.html), except when using delayMs with 0 or higher value or using throttling the `gateway.servlet.async.supported` configuration must be set to `true` in `gateway-site.xml` configuration file (it defaults to false)! \r\nAn example topology configuration:\r\nTopology:\r\n```\r\n<provider>\r\n            <role>dos</role>\r\n            <name>JettyDoS</name>\r\n            <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n            <param>\r\n                <name>maxRequestsPerSec</name>\r\n                <value>1</value>\r\n            </param>\r\n            <param>\r\n                <name>delayMs</name>\r\n                <value>0</value>\r\n

<name>gateway.servlet.async.supported</name>\r\n        <value>true</value>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested it by configuring the `JettyDoS` provider in the sandbox topology and sending curl requests to a server through the gateway.\r\nsandbox configuration:\r\n```\r\n<provider>\r\n

tom:tom-password https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/hue &\r\nsleep 0.1\r\ncurl -k -u tom:tom-password https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/hue &\r\nsleep 0.1\r\ncurl -k -u tom:tom-password

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf the user supplied the same metadata name with different values in Knox's `getUserTokens` API, the result only contained tokens that matched the first name/value pair. This is now fixed by including all values of each metadata name during the filter logic.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested this feature and added the metadata/expected result matrix in KNOX-2805.\r\n\r\nThe `curl` command I used to create the tokens:\r\n```\r\ncurl -iku admin:admin-password --cookie \"hadoop-jwt=$HADOOP_JWT_COOKIE\" -X GET \"https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/knoxtoken/api/v1/token?md_Name=reina&md_Score=50\"\r\n\r\ncurl -iku admin:admin-password --cookie \"hadoop-jwt=$HADOOP_JWT_COOKIE\" -X GET \"https://localhost:8443/gateway/homepage/knoxtoken/api/v1/token?md_Name=mary&md_Score=100\"\r\n\r\ncurl -iku admin:admin-password --cookie \"hadoop-jwt=$HADOOP_JWT_COOKIE\" -X GET

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore writing a parameter (at provider, application, or service level) from a provider/descriptor pair into a topology, the parameter value has to be XML escaped so that it won't make the generated XML fail when Knox parses it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test case and resource (contains a simple `&` character in the provider resource) to the existing `SimpleDescriptorHandlerTest` suite that handles JSON type provider/descriptor pairs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I used this JSON in my local Knox Gateway deployment as a shared-provider config and confirmed that after my fix were applied the topology generation went well.\r\n\r\nShared-provider config JSON I used for testing (`shared-providers/smolnar.json`):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"providers\" : [ {\r\n    \"role\" : \"webappsec\",\r\n    \"name\" : \"WebAppSec\",\r\n    \"enabled\" : true,\r\n    \"params\" : {\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen `knox.token.user.limit.exceeded.action` is set to `REMOVE_OLDEST`, Knox tries to revoke the oldest token of the given user for who the token was created. It's true for impersonated tokens too.\r\nHowever, to be able to revoke a token one of the following conditions should be true:\r\n- the revoker is either configured using the `knox.token.renewer.whitelist` parameter\r\n- or, the revoker should remove its own token (see KNOX-2664)\r\n\r\nThe second condition was not updated though when the token-impersonation was implemented. From now on Knox considers a token an `own` token if either the `userName` metadata or the `createdBy` metadata matches the revoker subject (prior to this change we only considered the `userName` metadata).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit test case to prevent us from regression as well as executed manual testing as follows:\r\n- configured Knox this way:\r\n  - `gateway.knox.token.limit.per.user = 5` (gateway-site.xml)\r\n  - `knox.token.user.limit.exceeded.action = REMOVE_OLDEST` (homepage.xml)\r\n  - ` knox.token.proxyuser.guest.users = bob` (homepage.xml)\r\n  - ` knox.token.proxyuser.guest.hosts = *` (homepage.xml)\r\n- logged into the Knox Home page as `guest`\r\n- generated 6 tokens for user `bob` on the Token Generation UI\r\n- confirmed that only 5 tokens were created for `bob`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1685\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-09-07 at 14 44 49\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA brand new Maven module was created where all authentication-, and authorization-related REST API endpoints can/should be added in the future. Within this module, a new Knox service type was added called `KNOX-AUTH-SERVICE`, which should be added into any Knox topology like this:\r\n```\r\n    <service>\r\n         <role>KNOX-AUTH-SERVICE</role>\r\n    </service>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this JIRA I already implemented one REST API endpoint with a very simple job: If a valid principal is found in the incoming request, a header is added to the response (by default `X-Knox-Actor-ID`) with the principal name. In addition, if the authenticated subject has (have) group(s), they are added into comma-separated entries in the header(s) of the default form `X-Knox-Actor-Groups-#num`. Each group header has a character limit of 1000 to keep them reasonably sized. The header names can be customized via configuration properties.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nImplemented new unit test cases as well as run the following manual steps:\r\n1. Added the above-referenced new Knox service to the sandbox topology\r\n2. Executed the following `curl` commands and verified the `X-Knox-Actor-ID` header was properly populated.\r\n```\r\n$ curl -iku guest:guest-password https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/auth/api/v1/pre\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nDate: Tue, 23 Aug 2022 16:33:27 GMT\r\nSet-Cookie: KNOXSESSIONID=node01qn1mbdr94rhswx5i66zrdn5r0.node0; Path=/gateway/sandbox; Secure; HttpOnly\r\nExpires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\r\nSet-Cookie: rememberMe=deleteMe; Path=/gateway/sandbox; Max-Age=0; Expires=Mon, 22-Aug-2022 16:33:27 GMT; SameSite=lax\r\nX-Knox-Actor-ID: guest\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\n$ curl -iku tom:tom-password https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/auth/api/v1/pre\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nDate: Tue, 23 Aug 2022 16:33:45 GMT\r\nSet-Cookie: KNOXSESSIONID=node01w44u6anaenbvils5k1rx956n1.node0; Path=/gateway/sandbox; Secure; HttpOnly\r\nExpires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\r\nSet-Cookie: rememberMe=deleteMe; Path=/gateway/sandbox; Max-Age=0; Expires=Mon, 22-Aug-2022 16:33:45 GMT; SameSite=lax\r\nX-Knox-Actor-ID: tom\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\n$ curl -iku admin:admin-password https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/auth/api/v1/pre\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nDate: Tue, 23 Aug 2022 16:33:57 GMT\r\nSet-Cookie: KNOXSESSIONID=node062oijrd1x3821y26a9dx71ghw2.node0; Path=/gateway/sandbox; Secure; HttpOnly\r\nExpires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\r\nSet-Cookie: rememberMe=deleteMe; Path=/gateway/sandbox; Max-Age=0; Expires=Mon, 22-Aug-2022 16:33:57 GMT; SameSite=lax\r\nX-Knox-Actor-ID: admin\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n```\r\n3. Updated the `identity-assertion` provider in the sandbox topology with group mapping (it was easier than configuring the demo LDAP factory to lookup groups) as follows:\r\n```\r\n        <provider>\r\n            <role>identity-assertion</role>\r\n            <name>Default</name>\r\n            <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n            <param>\r\n                <name>group.principal.mapping</name\r\n                <value>admin=longGroupName1,longGroupName2,...,longGroupName99</value>\r\n            </param>\r\n        </provider>\r\n```\r\n4. Executed one of the above `curl` commands and verified the group headers were populated as expected:\r\n```\r\n$ curl -iku admin:admin-password

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanged the verifier, introduced a new function called `registerToken`, this function is checking the session limits for the given user and stores the  given token. Changed `verifySessionForUser` function, now this function only checks the limit but do not store token. These changes were needed, because previously in case of an attack we would generate tokens needlessly before verifying the session and checking the limit. Now we check the limit without a token before token generation, so in case of an attack we do not waste resources. And we add the token after token generation and also check the limit because thread safety requires it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have changed the unit tests in `InMemoryConcurrentSessionVerifierTest` and `WebSSOResourceTest` to test the new usage of the verifier.\r\nI also tested it manually with this configuration:\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n

Deployed a new topology called `tokenexchange`:\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<topology>\r\n    <name>tokenexchange</name>\r\n    <gateway>\r\n        <provider>\r\n           <role>federation</role>\r\n           <name>JWTProvider</name>\r\n           <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n           <param>\r\n               <name>knox.token.use.cookie</name>\r\n               <value>true</value>\r\n           </param>\r\n           <!--\r\n           <param>\r\n               <name>knox.token.cookie.name</name>\r\n               <value>customCookieName</value>\r\n           </param>\r\n           -->\r\n           <param>\r\n               <name>knox.token.exp.server-managed</name>\r\n               <value>true</value>\r\n           </param>\r\n        </provider>\r\n    </gateway>\r\n    <service>\r\n       <role>KNOXTOKEN</role>\r\n       <param>\r\n          <name>knox.token.ttl</name>\r\n          <value>36000000</value>\r\n       </param>\r\n    </service>\r\n</topology>\r\n```\r\nStarted Knox and ran the following `curl` commands. Please note that at one point I included the `knox.token.cookie.name` configuration too (see below cases):\r\n\r\n**1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduced new group called `gateway.session.verification.unlimited.users` and  changed the behaviour of the groups and the tests that check these behaviours. `gateway.non.privileged.users` group is now not configurable.\r\nAlso changed configuration names:\r\n```\r\ngateway.privileged.users -> gateway.session.verification.privileged.users\r\ngateway.non.privileged.users.concurrent.session.limit -> gateway.session.verification.non.privileged.user.limit\r\ngateway.privileged.users.concurrent.session.limit -> gateway.session.verification.privileged.user.limit\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrevious behaviour:\r\nIf someone is configured privileged -> privileged limit applies\r\nIf someone is configured non-privileged -> non-privileged limit applies\r\nIf someone is not configured in either of the groups -> no limit applies\r\n\r\nNew behaviour:\r\nIf someone is configured privileged -> privileged limit applies\r\nIf someone is configured unlimited -> no limit applies\r\nIf someone is not configured in either of the groups -> non-privileged limit applies\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI changed the existing unit tests to test the new behaviours.\r\nI also tested the new behaviours manually with the following configurataions:\r\n1. Nothing\r\n2. Empty string for implementation configuration\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.service.concurrentsessionverifier.impl</name>\r\n        <value></value>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n3.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI added an empty implementation of the `ConcurrentSessionVerifier` (`EmptyConcurrentSessionVerifier`), now it is the default so users do not waste resources when they forget to configure the verifier. If they need the `InMemoryConcurrentSessionVerifier` implementation they need to configure it and pay attention to configure at least one user in at least one of the groups.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.privileged.users</name>\r\n        <value>admin</value>\r\n</property>\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.service.concurrentsessionverifier.impl</name>\r\n        <value>org.apache.knox.gateway.session.control.InMemoryConcurrentSessionVerifier</value>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also added a background thread which cleans out the expired tokens from the `InMemoryConcurrentSessionVerifier` to save some resources. The default cleaning time is 30 minutes, but it can be configured by adding how many minutes we want the cleaning period to be:\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.session.verification.expired.tokens.cleaning.period</name>\r\n        <value>80</value>\r\n</property>\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.privileged.users</name>\r\n        <value>admin</value>\r\n</property>\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.service.concurrentsessionverifier.impl</name>\r\n        <value>org.apache.knox.gateway.session.control.InMemoryConcurrentSessionVerifier</value>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have written unit tests for the `ConcurrentSessionVeriferFactory` to test that the factory gives back the right implementation for the right configuration.\r\nI also added a unit test into `InMemoryConcurrentSessionVerifierTest` to test the background thread removing the expired tokens.\r\nI also added stress tests to `InMemoryConcurrentSessionVerifierTest` to test whether the locking is working and the `InMemoryConcurrentSessionVerifier` is truly thread safe.\r\n\r\nI also tested the behaviour with the following configurations:\r\n\r\n1. Nothing\r\n2. Empty String\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.service.concurrentsessionverifier.impl</name>\r\n        <value></value>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n3. Empty implementation\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.service.concurrentsessionverifier.impl</name>\r\n        <value>org.apache.knox.gateway.session.control.EmptyConcurrentSessionVerifier</value>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n4. InMemory implementation without groups configured\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.service.concurrentsessionverifier.impl</name>\r\n        <value>org.apache.knox.gateway.session.control.InMemoryConcurrentSessionVerifier</value>\r\n</property>\r\n```\r\n5. InMemory fully configured\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.non.privileged.users</name>\r\n        <value>tom,guest</value>\r\n</property>\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.privileged.users</name>\r\n        <value>admin</value>\r\n</property>\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.privileged.users.concurrent.session.limit</name>\r\n        <value>2</value>\r\n</property>\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.non.privileged.users.concurrent.session.limit</name>\r\n        <value>1</value>\r\n</property>\r\n<property>\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ConcurrentSessionVerifier` is changed to be used and initilaized like a service, because initializing it in `GatewayServer` `main()` felt out of place. It is also modified to store the tokens issued at login so the expiry can be tracked since we don t have an event to subscribe to when the tokens expire. The verifier was put in `WebSSOResource` and `WebSSOutResource` to count the issued tokens when logged in or out.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested it manually by configuring `gateway-site.xml` and logging in and out from different browsers.\r\nConfiguration:\r\n```\r\n<property>\r\n        <name>gateway.non.privileged.users</name>\r\n        <value>tom,guest</value>\r\n </property>\r\n <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.privileged.users</name>\r\n        <value>admin</value>\r\n  </property>\r\n  <property>\r\n

<name>gateway.non.privileged.users.concurrent.session.limit</name>\r\n        <value>1</value>\r\n  </property>\r\n```\r\nI also wrote unit tests for `WebSSOResource` which test reaching privileged and non-privileged limit when logging

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn order to make the `user-auth-test` KnoxCLI command work after the 1.6 Shiro upgrade, I'd to add the `invalidRequest` filter's object class (`org.apache.shiro.web.filter.InvalidRequestFilter`) into the `main` section in the generated shiro.ini. Without that change, an error was thrown (see the corresponding JIRA).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan the `GatewayShiroAuthTest` that covers use-cases for Shiro LDAP authentication including a valid service URL with a semicolon (`;jsessionid=OI24B9ASD7BSSD`).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1307\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-07-20 at 11 20 44\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI’ve added implementation in `GatewayConfig` , `GatewayConfigImpl` and `GatewayTestConfig` to receive the following parameters from the gateway-site.xml file. \r\n`gateway.non.privileged.users`\r\n`gateway.privileged.users`\r\n`gateway.privileged.user.concurrent.session.limit`\r\n`gateway.non.privileged.user.concurrent.session.limit`\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n```\r\n   <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.non.privileged.users</name>\r\n        <value>tom,guest</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.privileged.users</name>\r\n        <value>admin</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.privileged.user.concurrent.session.limit</name>\r\n        <value>3</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n    <property>\r\n        <name>gateway.non.privileged.user.concurrent.session.limit</name>\r\n        <value>2</value>\r\n    </property>\r\n```\r\nIt is not yet used, but it is necessary for the jira 2778 which depends on this one.\r\n\r\nI’ve also created `ConcurrentSessionVerifier` class which will be used to keep track of the concurrent sessions of the users and verify whether they fit in the limit (based on their group) or not.\r\nIt is not yet wired in, but also necessary for the jira 2778. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI’ve written unit tests for the new parameters in `GatewayConfigImplTest` class where I test the default parameters and what if the user adds normal and abnormal parameters. Result of the tests:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]  T E S T S\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Running org.apache.knox.gateway.config.impl.GatewayConfigImplTest\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 20, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.055 s - in org.apache.knox.gateway.config.impl.GatewayConfigImplTest\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 20, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  8.831 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2022-07-14T16:49:26+02:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nI’ve also written unit tests for the `ConcurrentSessionVerifier` class in the `ConcurrentSessionVerifierTest` class. These tests test the following:\r\n-The user is in neither of the two groups\r\n-The user is in both groups\r\n-User is privileged and goes over the session limit, then ends a session and goes over the limit again\r\n-Same with non privileged users\r\n-One of the limits is 0\r\n-We end sessions before even creating them\r\n\r\nResult of the tests:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO]

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe replayBufferSize log level was changed from debug to info, to prevent confusion on what value was used, since it can be configured in two

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanged log level of http connection timeout and socket timeout to from DEBUG to INFO and added INFO level log for retry count and retry non safe request parameters, because sometimes clients were confused why the timeout parameters haven't changed even though they changed it in gateway-site.xml, but service.xml override-s it. Now they can see in the log what is the value of these parameters, only after the first request after topology deployment.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested it manually, using ```curl -k -u tom:tom-password https://localhost:8443/gateway/sandbox/hive``` command from terminal.\r\n\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs the corresponding JIRA states, #494 changed some of the HTTP methods in `TokenResource` that the KnoxShell classes were missing to implement.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExecuted the existing unit tests (no new tests were added in this case; it wasn't needed) and ran manual tests using Knox's [performance test tool](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KNOX/KNOX-2402+-+Develop+a+performance-test+framework+to+test+token+state+service).\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, I also tested these changes together with the newly added retry functionality in KnoxShell (thanks, @zeroflag for the detailed test steps in #568):\r\nMini HTTP server with the following Pharo image\r\n```\r\n| c  | \r\nc := 0.\r\nTeapot on\r\n  GET: '/knoxtoken/api/v1/token' -> [ \r\n    c := c + 1.\r\n    Transcript\r\n       cr;\r\n       show: 'Incoming request c=', c asString.\r\n\r\n    c < 3 \r\n      ifTrue:[ TeaResponse code: 503 ] \r\n      ifFalse: [ 'OK' ] \r\n  ];\r\n  PUT: '/knoxtoken/api/v1/token/renew' -> [ \r\n\t:request |\r\n\tc := c + 1.\r\n\tTranscript \r\n\t  cr;\r\n\t  show: 'Req # ', c asString, ' Token = ', request entity string .\r\n    c < 3 \r\n      ifTrue:[ TeaResponse code: 503 ] \r\n      ifFalse: [ 'OK' ] \r\n  ];\r\n  start. \r\n```\r\n\r\nTest code:\r\n```\r\npackage org.apache.knox.gateway.shell.knox.token;\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.knox.gateway.shell.ClientContext;\r\nimport org.apache.knox.gateway.shell.KnoxSession;\r\n\r\npublic class KnoxTokenTest {\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n    ClientContext context = ClientContext.with(\"http://localhost:1701\");\r\n    context.connection().retryCount(2);\r\n    KnoxSession session = KnoxSession.login(context);\r\n    System.out.println( Token.renew(session, \"token 1\").now().getString() );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning it worked as expected; the output in Pharo was the following:\r\n```\r\nReq # 1 Token = token 1\r\nReq # 2 Token = token 1\r\nReq # 3 Token = token 1\r\n```","created_at":"2022-06-14T13:30:35Z","updated_at":"2022-06-16T07:38:27Z","closed_at":"2022-06-16T07:38:24Z","merged_at":"2022-06-16T07:38:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"50a0552dc428069f396fe4926f4bff0e97372cfc","assignee":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pzampino","id":13018719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDE4NzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13018719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino","html_url":"https://github.com/pzampino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzampino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"moresandeep","id":380997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDk5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/380997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep","html_url":"https://github.com/moresandeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moresandeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1732098396,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzMyMDk4Mzk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/labels/knoxshell","name":"knoxshell","color":"97abef","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/issues/593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/knox/statuses/cc81d012ddd999bd2a1ad42005ea5fd679764213","head":{"label":"smolnar82:KNOX-2761","ref":"KNOX-2761","sha":"cc81d012ddd999bd2a1ad42005ea5fd679764213","user":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_i

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFrom now on, in Knox's HadoopGroupProvider, the gateway-level `CENTRAL_GROUP_CONFIG_PREFIX` prefixed parameters are added together with any custom provider-level parameters into the final `HadoopGroupProvider` identity assertion filter of the generated web application.\r\n\r\nI also needed to re-factor some code out from the `gateway-server` project that implements certain descriptor-related interfaces from `gateway-spi` as a simple POJO. The new Maven module's name is `gateway-spi-common` and I already see the benefit of having this new project serving the same functionality for other developments in the future.\r\nWith this new project we now do not need to create/mock already existing classes that we can re-use in our test classes where mocking isn't a really good option.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests to check if filter properties are generated as expected. Apart from this, I also tested the fix manually with my local Knox instance using the `Steps to reproduce` information from the corresponding JIRA:\r\n```\r\n        <filter>\r\n
