In addition this PR fixed some of the logging arguments as well e.g. not calling toString on an argument.\r\nIf possible, please port these changes to both the 1.x and 2.x branches. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [x] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [x] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [x] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [x] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [x] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13307](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13307) Replaces `KeyStoreUtils` in `nifi-security-utils` with Builder classes from the `nifi-security-ssl` module.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-security-ssl` module has no external dependencies and provides specific Builder interfaces and classes to instantiate various TLS components. These classes are already widely used throughout the system, leaving minimal references to `KeyStoreUtils`. In addition, adjusting the custom validation logic in `StandardSSLContextService` reduced unnecessary loading of KeyStore files.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include removing a number of unused test classes from `nifi-web-api`, some of which had references to `KeyStoreUtils` methods. Other adjustments include relocating the `HashService` and `HashAlgorithm` classes to the `nifi-standard-processors` module, since the `CryptographicHashContent` Processor was the only consumer of these specialized components.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13296](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13296) Deprecates Kerberos [SPNEGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPNEGO) authentication for subsequent removal in NiFi 2. This deprecation applies to framework-level configuration as opposed to username and password-based authentication using the Kerberos Login Identity Provider.\r\n\r\nKerberos SPNEGO authentication requires non-standard [client browser configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security-kerberos/docs/current/reference/html/browserspnegoconfig.html) that is specific to particular host addresses, whereas standards-based Single Sign-On integration using OpenID Connect or SAML 2 does not have similar constraints.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [ ] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI. Any contributions that update the [current UI](https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui) also need to be implemented in the [new

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13295](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13295) Removes Apache Knox [Single Sign-On](https://knox.apache.org/books/knox-1-6-0/user-guide.html#SSO+Cookie+Provider) authentication from the main branch for NiFi 2.\r\n\r\nOpenID Connect and SAML 2 integration provide standards-based SSO without reference to particular identity providers.\r\n\r\nThis removal does

Adding support for navigating back to the users previous location in certain circumstances like going to a Controller Service, managing access policies, going to parameters, viewing documentation, opening advanced UIs, and viewing data provenance.\r\n- Cleaning unnecessary instances of postUpdateNavigation.\r\n\r\nThe scenarios mentioned in the commit message above have a slightly different UX from the existing application. In the old UI, these actions would open in a large modal on top of the current component. When the user was done they could return to where they were by closing the modal. In the new UI, the user currently needs to use their browser back button as the application did not directly offer a back option. This PR introduces that back option but only in the cases identified above. Scenarios outside of this (other links in the application like Referencing Components) are not included here but could be considered in the future as a further improvement over the old UI.","created_at":"2024-05-21T15:57:54Z","updated_at":"2024-05-28T19:57:16Z","closed_at":"2024-05-28T19:57:16Z","merged_at":"2024-05-28T19:57:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"f0e1cdcb22f1fdeef804a005813edc0c09929d87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6268187900,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAanjsM8AAAABdZz0_A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/new%20ui","name":"new

I had tried to pick values when configuring an instance of `io.netty.handler.ssl.ApplicationProtocolConfig` which seemed to align to what `JdkDefaultApplicationProtocolNegotiator` offered but the review of this PR has to confirm this. There is no unit test which exercises this.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [x] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [x] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [x] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [x] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [x] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI.

When a parameter reference \r\n#{parameter} is in the sensitive property value then it is displayed to the user. If anything else if the sensitive property value, then the value is obfuscated from the user with text \"Sensitive value set\"\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\nImplemented in both the current and new UI.\r\n\r\n- [X] NiFi is modernizing its UI. Any contributions that update the [current UI](https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui) also need to be implemented in the [new

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13236](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13236) Corrects filename encoding for the HTTP `Content-Disposition` header when downloading files from FlowFile Queues or Provenance event references over HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP/2 protocol implementation in Jetty 12 includes character encoding validation for HTTP response headers, resulting in an `IllegalArgumentException` when attempting to write invalid characters. [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html) requires that HTTP header values consist of specific characters in the ASCII character set, so characters outside of the set must be encoded.\r\n\r\nThe Spring Framework [ContentDisposition](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/ContentDisposition.html) supports parsing and encoding filename values according to RFC standards. Replacing existing `Content-Disposition` header formatting with encoded formatting based on the Spring Framework class enables support for extended character sets, such as UTF-8.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI. Any contributions that update the [current UI](https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/main/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-web/nifi-web-ui) also need to be implemented in the [new

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13232](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13232) Adds a new REST API method for returning authentication configuration details.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the new method is to provide sufficient details for the user interface to determine when to show the login screen and when to show the logout link.\r\n\r\nThe REST API method is designed to support current authentication strategies, including username and password authentication with a Login Identity Provider, as well as single sign-on with either OIDC or SAML. The method should also return correct status when the client makes a request using mutual TLS with a client certificate. The mutual TLS scenario may require an additional field because when NiFi is running behind a reverse proxy, the proxy itself will provide a client certificate, but the client web browser should be presented with a login screen or be redirected for single sign-on.\r\n\r\nChanges include adding a `credentials` property to the authentication token class, providing access to the JSON Web Token or Client Certificates passed during the initial authentication process.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI.
