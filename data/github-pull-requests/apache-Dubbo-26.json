easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-10T02:26:47Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T02:26:54Z","closed_at":"2022-11-10T02:26:54Z","merged_at":"2022-11-10T02:26:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc1162feb8fc613c9529d86f996b934d480ac77b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d61053cf3014e6ba24766807768dcb5f19380c47","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1110_fix_ut","ref":"1110_fix_ut","sha":"d61053cf3014e6ba24766807768dcb5f19380c47","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-09T12:20:27Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T07:22:28Z","closed_at":"2022-11-10T07:22:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8a939f588821a498793481977e8b5e683d004200","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10902/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10902/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10902/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/458a91463a2f15d078019e3c1ea7d909e80bf59b","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1109_sonarcloud","ref":"1109_sonarcloud","sha":"458a91463a2f15d078019e3c1ea7d909e80bf59b","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFixes #10892\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nWhen `subscribeUrl` is null, use default server shutdown timeout.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-08T07:06:47Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T02:08:04Z","closed_at":"2022-11-09T02:08:04Z","merged_at":"2022-11-09T02:08:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"70660cb9697fac3c48bcfad0f80dff7d09dbc05c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f0b4740986122f4394673c8877f157d72b36a048","head":{"label":"pandaapo:3.1-issue10892","ref":"3.1-issue10892","sha":"f0b4740986122f4394673c8877f157d72b36a048","user":{"login":"pandaapo","id":35672972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjcyOTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35672972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo","html_url":"https://github.com/pandaapo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":539269165,"node_id":"R_kgDOICSYLQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pandaapo/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pandaapo","id":35672972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjcyOTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35672972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo","html_url":"https://github.com/pandaapo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pandaapo/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-08T02:13:31Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T10:28:56Z","closed_at":"2022-11-08T03:34:05Z","merged_at":"2022-11-08T03:34:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"305d290e5fa8491803f9fc4f0d1088a316eaf3f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/60","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/60","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/60/labels","id":8476441,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AgVcZ","number":60,"title":"3.1.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":9,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-09-29T02:34:05Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T03:25:35Z","due_on":"2022-10-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-11-11T03:25:35Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10891/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10891/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10891/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b2332b8a0591ae8b748091f28d6361026b5ce770","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1108_fix_return_types","ref":"1108_fix_return_types","sha":"b2332b8a0591ae8b748091f28d6361026b5ce770","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-07T07:14:41Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T09:11:54Z","closed_at":"2022-11-07T09:11:53Z","merged_at":"2022-11-07T09:11:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"6e400575240a83d9ca7845741629ec7f359c2e46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10886/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10886/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/20e8febee32cfc0fc6313db7aa9b94e5376cb100","head":{"label":"asa3311:Support-netty3-and-other-transporters-in-port-unification","ref":"Support-netty3-and-other-transporters-in-port-unification","sha":"20e8febee32cfc0fc6313db7aa9b94e5376cb100","user":{"login":"asa3311","id":19684366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Njg0MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19684366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311","html_url":"https://github.com/asa3311","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"5016f550be52f14a232399409a3c97fa6d6db321","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`ConfigCenterConfig` doesn't honor username and password in `toUrl` method. It requires specifying username/password in `address` filed.\r\n\r\nWhen working with spring-boot and dubbo-registry-nacos, it required bellow config:\r\n```yaml\r\ndubbo:\r\n  application:\r\n    name: demo-client\r\n  registry:\r\n    register: false\r\n    address: nacos://nacos-server?username={username}&password={password}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems hacky. After this change, it becomes:\r\n```yaml\r\ndubbo:\r\n  registry:\r\n    address: nacos://nacos-server\r\n    username: nacos_test\r\n    password: nacos_test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nsimply add username and password when building the URL.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7 **YES, necessary**\r\n- [X] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [X] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-31T05:45:22Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T13:27:04Z","closed_at":"2022-10-31T13:27:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e659563a8bafda7c6051ba61719a5fc210bf5e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/34ee3ce9e8205e0e48fa320d9a34d202b3bfb72d","head":{"label":"LiveOrange:master","ref":"master","sha":"34ee3ce9e8205e0e48fa320d9a34d202b3bfb72d","user":{"login":"LiveOrange","id":20442302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDQyMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20442302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange","html_url":"https://github.com/LiveOrange","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":398983804,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTg5ODM4MDQ=","name":"Apache-dubbo","full_name":"LiveOrange/Apache-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LiveOrange","id":20442302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDQyMzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20442302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange","html_url":"https://github.com/LiveOrange","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiveOrange/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LiveOrange/Apache-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-31T02:58:32Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T10:14:41Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T23:27:35Z","merged_at":"2022-11-02T23:27:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e77b6b94acff58c44974351e1bf1e43c8977c3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10855/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10855/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10855/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/31aae5e2e7bc4ae56a2f8f2c786c4054de83b0fc","head":{"label":"funky-eyes:read_dubbo_protocol","ref":"read_dubbo_protocol","sha":"31aae5e2e7bc4ae56a2f8f2c786c4054de83b0fc","user":{"login":"funky-eyes","id":19943636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQzNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19943636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes","html_url":"https://github.com/funky-eyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378361114,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzgzNjExMTQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"funky-eyes/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"funky-eyes","id":19943636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQzNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19943636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes","html_url":"https://github.com/funky-eyes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funky-eyes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/funky-eyes/dubbo","description":"Apache

sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFixes #10823\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nWhen there is no specific protocol for metadata service, get available protocol from environment before using default.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nConfigure a dubbo application like:\r\n```\r\ndubbo:\r\n  application:\r\n    name: dubbo-springboot-demo-provider\r\n  protocol:\r\n    name: tri # or other valid protocol\r\n  registry:\r\n    id: zk-registry\r\n    address: zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181\r\n  config-center:\r\n    address: zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181\r\n  metadata-report:\r\n    address: zookeeper://127.0.0.1:2181\r\n```\r\nThere will be no `java.util.NoSuchElementException` thrown in `ConfigurableMetadataServiceExporter.getProtocolConfig(String)` when start this application.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-28T12:42:45Z","updated_at":"2022-11-12T07:56:44Z","closed_at":"2022-11-12T07:56:44Z","merged_at":"2022-11-12T07:56:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"aec3f84c6538d3e24fe2a55a9011854fd2444b02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10846/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10846/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10846/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/417262b8ca1ec5d6155c86ab0b193547ea52c581","head":{"label":"pandaapo:3.1-issue10823","ref":"3.1-issue10823","sha":"417262b8ca1ec5d6155c86ab0b193547ea52c581","user":{"login":"pandaapo","id":35672972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjcyOTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35672972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo","html_url":"https://github.com/pandaapo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":539269165,"node_id":"R_kgDOICSYLQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pandaapo/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pandaapo","id":35672972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjcyOTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35672972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo","html_url":"https://github.com/pandaapo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pandaapo/dubbo","description":"Apache

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-27T02:30:13Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T07:37:33Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T07:37:33Z","merged_at":"2022-12-05T07:37:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"1470c7ca1eeba0ad4bcb309678e5c432bbfc002f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/65","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/65","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/65/labels","id":8704553,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4AhNIp","number":65,"title":"3.1.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":7,"state":"closed","created_at":"2022-11-30T02:54:22Z","updated_at":"2022-12-22T07:51:16Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-12-22T07:51:16Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/64af9ac3f2e647acecf3235b927e34fcab771bde","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/performance_of_configuration","ref":"feat/performance_of_configuration","sha":"64af9ac3f2e647acecf3235b927e34fcab771bde","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-26T16:08:11Z","updated_at":"2022-10-27T02:40:41Z","closed_at":"2022-10-27T02:40:13Z","merged_at":"2022-10-27T02:40:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"6ed4cc2457fbcb2380d11d9f6d6c885e723bc08b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10837/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10837/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10837/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4621b15a580f6d1b928c7c709231e5de85d419ee","head":{"label":"cnjxzhao:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"4621b15a580f6d1b928c7c709231e5de85d419ee","user":{"login":"cnjxzhao","id":85160585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTYwNTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85160585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/cnjxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373103481,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzMxMDM0ODE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"cnjxzhao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cnjxzhao","id":85160585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTYwNTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85160585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/cnjxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cnjxzhao/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-26T07:35:59Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T03:07:02Z","closed_at":"2022-11-02T03:07:01Z","merged_at":"2022-11-02T03:07:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"d7c8d10dbf64219761502d7af0a29398ece9f55b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10834/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10834/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10834/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/837bf35ce245957ce484d17b742fca6d81072995","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1026_fix_destroy","ref":"1026_fix_destroy","sha":"837bf35ce245957ce484d17b742fca6d81072995","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-25T14:14:45Z","updated_at":"2022-11-07T06:10:35Z","closed_at":"2022-11-07T06:10:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a420e2e0f7bd79cf0117e57fd0b230fab9da538","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10828/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10828/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10828/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/07795206c2a2d8686fc7f1549c0bbef5b5626719","head":{"label":"saleson:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"07795206c2a2d8686fc7f1549c0bbef5b5626719","user":{"login":"saleson","id":4346834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDY4MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4346834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saleson","html_url":"https://github.com/saleson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saleson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saleson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saleson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saleson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saleson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saleson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saleson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saleson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saleson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"15f4a7d7cbbd4ba1c580f4c3673b2854cef52f0b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-24T15:26:12Z","updated_at":"2022-10-25T03:58:11Z","closed_at":"2022-10-25T03:58:11Z","merged_at":"2022-10-25T03:58:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d289883e726c130008d978a2ec24d2611dc7668","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/24f3b02af050c93aca1ade2679be577953aed3bd","head":{"label":"cnjxzhao:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"24f3b02af050c93aca1ade2679be577953aed3bd","user":{"login":"cnjxzhao","id":85160585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTYwNTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85160585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/cnjxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373103481,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzMxMDM0ODE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"cnjxzhao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cnjxzhao","id":85160585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTYwNTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85160585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao","html_url":"https://github.com/cnjxzhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnjxzhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cnjxzhao/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-24T04:50:10Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T08:46:42Z","closed_at":"2022-11-22T08:08:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d902b5f005e088fd2f0e2b16bd6a4fbbc7ddadd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10811/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10811/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10811/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/64a1d13cc369d3b564d2cba9ac1955be7c9dbd3c","head":{"label":"asa3311:tri-flow","ref":"tri-flow","sha":"64a1d13cc369d3b564d2cba9ac1955be7c9dbd3c","user":{"login":"asa3311","id":19684366,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Njg0MzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19684366?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311","html_url":"https://github.com/asa3311","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asa3311/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"4451bfa29c878747239775289514ccf664a4595e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-23T04:18:29Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T02:44:28Z","closed_at":"2022-10-29T02:44:28Z","merged_at":"2022-10-29T02:44:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"d78a5db69881199beaf8ba47c21cde2a9da481f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10791/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10791/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10791/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bec678bdb35f09cdf3277b425fcb7ceaa9007ee0","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1023_json_utils","ref":"1023_json_utils","sha":"bec678bdb35f09cdf3277b425fcb7ceaa9007ee0","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-23T03:51:27Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T04:31:19Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T04:31:19Z","merged_at":"2022-10-24T04:31:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"d04f03a94267707523d6c937cb84cee2bb945953","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4207a08a6f35020bcf7e1cf673d395ade6a8ec8f","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1023_fix_corn","ref":"1023_fix_corn","sha":"4207a08a6f35020bcf7e1cf673d395ade6a8ec8f","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-22T09:14:37Z","updated_at":"2022-10-23T03:32:36Z","closed_at":"2022-10-23T03:32:36Z","merged_at":"2022-10-23T03:32:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a71716fb30ead617cb19776c813b29c92597250","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10786/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10786/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10786/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6ad1ccba30ec451fdc5ad14feceb71459834d39f","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1022_ignore","ref":"1022_ignore","sha":"6ad1ccba30ec451fdc5ad14feceb71459834d39f","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-18T05:41:24Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T12:43:06Z","closed_at":"2022-10-18T12:43:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15d013c4e4525c0643204da2b5121565db5efce2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/54b0b10d512b724aa39ba2c428638549e55a09ce","head":{"label":"EarthChen:support-attachment-insensitive","ref":"support-attachment-insensitive","sha":"54b0b10d512b724aa39ba2c428638549e55a09ce","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"15f4a7d7cbbd4ba1c580f4c3673b2854cef52f0b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFixes #10709\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nMark Dubbo Module if is spring managed. Wait the module bound to Spring to be handled by Spring before Dubbo shutdown hook executing.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-11T02:58:55Z","updated_at":"2024-09-13T03:18:37Z","closed_at":"2022-10-17T02:53:37Z","merged_at":"2022-10-17T02:53:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"c65754681c779f4490bb9c78ff0a0e9a72a4f7a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10730/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10730/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10730/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c616103081fd747239e7aee8aa428950586a43fe","head":{"label":"pandaapo:3.1-issue10709","ref":"3.1-issue10709","sha":"c616103081fd747239e7aee8aa428950586a43fe","user":{"login":"pandaapo","id":35672972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjcyOTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35672972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo","html_url":"https://github.com/pandaapo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":539269165,"node_id":"R_kgDOICSYLQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pandaapo/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pandaapo","id":35672972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjcyOTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35672972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo","html_url":"https://github.com/pandaapo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pandaapo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pandaapo/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-11T02:54:14Z","updated_at":"2022-10-12T02:59:20Z","closed_at":"2022-10-12T02:59:19Z","merged_at":"2022-10-12T02:59:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ea7803280751b9e8633e9d81ea0c61fef88e1af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10729/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10729/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10729/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/42d99a9804fa0736fd7f14d4abbd25c9f91c28c1","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1011_fix_xds","ref":"1011_fix_xds","sha":"42d99a9804fa0736fd7f14d4abbd25c9f91c28c1","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-10T03:50:13Z","updated_at":"2023-02-15T07:50:53Z","closed_at":"2023-02-15T07:50:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"065b4a0687bda9f6dcf55b6b4f58a083300ee64d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10720/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10720/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10720/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4f36e7f69925cf7ab9221a916f8ca3cc83bc08ca","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1010_ssl","ref":"1010_ssl","sha":"4f36e7f69925cf7ab9221a916f8ca3cc83bc08ca","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-09T02:11:14Z","updated_at":"2022-10-10T02:21:07Z","closed_at":"2022-10-09T09:35:52Z","merged_at":"2022-10-09T09:35:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"f5c8f5930f59d64ca0df1e0ee651d9ec48f77364","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10711/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10711/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10711/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/18890f2f0cfe4e19e0a6be4449cd7de13a2090f6","head":{"label":"ilaotan:3.2-jvmUtil-print-line","ref":"3.2-jvmUtil-print-line","sha":"18890f2f0cfe4e19e0a6be4449cd7de13a2090f6","user":{"login":"ilaotan","id":6210438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMTA0Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6210438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan","html_url":"https://github.com/ilaotan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":548131960,"node_id":"R_kgDOIKvUeA","name":"dubbo-apache","full_name":"ilaotan/dubbo-apache","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ilaotan","id":6210438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMTA0Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6210438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan","html_url":"https://github.com/ilaotan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilaotan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ilaotan/dubbo-apache","description":"Apache

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protobuf Release v3.16.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging.

definition\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFixes #10682\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nAlthough configure `dubbo.application.qos-enable=true`, it may not work. You may find provider is started successfully without qos server.\r\nIn fact, qos dependency is necessary for qos server to start successfully. But the reason is not obvious.\r\n~~So I define an annotation `@QosServer`. It has no function, but can guide developers to import qos dependency.~~\r\nI check `qos-enable` during app startup. When there is no `qos-enable=false` and no dubbo-qos dependency, `logg.warn` some information.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nrun [dubbo-demo-xml-provider](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/tree/3.1/dubbo-demo/dubbo-demo-xml/dubbo-demo-xml-provider)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

GitHub Actions 中 warn, error 链接指向的检查机制。\r\n\r\nThis pull request implements the mechanism that checks (document links of) error code in logger invocations.\r\n\r\n# 功能 / Features\r\n## 中文\r\n1. 代码中全部错误码的提取 （见下述截图中的 All Error Codes 部分）\r\n2. 错误码文档链接失效的判定 （见下述截图中的 Error codes which document links are not reachable 部分）\r\n3. 未用错误码的 Logger 方法的提示 （见下述截图中的 Illegal logger method invocations 部分）\r\n4. GitHub Actions 的自动检查。（目前不会抛出异常。其会将结果上传到 GitHub 的 Artifacts。）\r\n\r\n## English\r\n1. Error code extraction. ('All Error Codes' in screenshot)\r\n2. Link testing of document of error codes. ('Error codes which document links are not reachable' in screenshot)\r\n3. Hint of logger method invocations which don't use error code. ('Illegal logger method invocations' in screenshot)\r\n4. Automatic checking in GitHub Actions. (Currently it does not throw exception. It will upload result to artifacts in GitHub Actions.)\r\n\r\n# Actions 的运行截图 / Screenshot in GitHub Actions\r\n![eci-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4351489/192001227-36315550-60e4-4846-9550-d4cd1e2363c5.jpg)\r\n\r\n# 运行 / Run\r\n## GitHub Actions 自动运行 / Automatically run in GitHub Actions\r\nGitHub Actions 会在代码推送时自动运行本程序。可以到 Artifacts 下载 GitHub Actions 的运行结果。文件名为 `error-inspection-result.txt`。\r\n\r\nThis program will be executed by GitHub Actions when someone pushes patches.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-26T09:56:58Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T01:46:28Z","closed_at":"2022-09-27T01:46:27Z","merged_at":"2022-09-27T01:46:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6748c7cb76fddc01c95433d866999350e38a4c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10677/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/10677/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/10677/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cc547d9b886d906b22a94912ac7e7824ba0b0147","head":{"label":"JavaLionLi:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"cc547d9b886d906b22a94912ac7e7824ba0b0147","user":{"login":"JavaLionLi","id":31852897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODUyODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31852897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi","html_url":"https://github.com/JavaLionLi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":541516233,"node_id":"R_kgDOIEbhyQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"JavaLionLi/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JavaLionLi","id":31852897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODUyODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31852897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi","html_url":"https://github.com/JavaLionLi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JavaLionLi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JavaLionLi/dubbo","description":"Apache
