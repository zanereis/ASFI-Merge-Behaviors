What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen use PeriodicGraphCheckpointer to persist graph, sometimes the edges isn't persisted. As currently only when vertices's storage level is none, graph is persisted. However there is a chance vertices's storage level is not none while edges's is none. Eg. graph created by a outerJoinVertices operation, vertices is automatically cached while edges is not. In this way, edges will not be persisted if we use PeriodicGraphCheckpointer do persist. We need separately check edges's storage level and persisted it if it's none.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhile getting the batch for a `FileStreamSource` in StructuredStreaming, we know which files we must take specifically. We already have verified that they exist, and have committed them to a metadata log. When creating the FileSourceRelation however for an incremental execution, the code checks the existence of every single file once again!\n\nWhen you have 100,000s of files in a folder, creating the first batch takes 2 hours+ when working with S3! This PR disables that check\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a unit test to `FileStreamSource`.\n","created_at":"2016-09-16T23:05:23Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:54:40Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T00:14:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43f9ba8f988eae2806c2625f2c28f156d616eec0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/666c2c50114349eeae5bf0d532e03a13de09c434","head":{"label":"brkyvz:SPARK-17569","ref":"SPARK-17569","sha":"666c2c50114349eeae5bf0d532e03a13de09c434","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

goal of this feature is to allow the Spark driver to run in an\nisolated environment, such as a docker container, and be able to use\nthe host's port forwarding mechanism to be able to accept connections\nfrom the outside world.\n\nThe change is restricted to the driver: there is no support for achieving\nthe same thing on executors (or the YARN AM for that matter). Those still\nneed full access to the outside world so that, for example, connections\ncan be made to an executor's block manager.\n\nThe core of the change is simple: add a new configuration that tells what's\nthe address the driver should bind to, which can be different than the address\nit advertises to executors (spark.driver.host). Everything else is plumbing\nthe new configuration where it's needed.\n\nTo use the feature, the host starting the container needs to set up the\ndriver's port range to fall into a range that is being forwarded; this\nrequired the block manager port to need a special configuration just for\nthe driver, which falls back to the existing spark.blockManager.port when\nnot set. This way, users can modify the driver settings without affecting\nthe executors; it would theoretically be nice to also have different\nretry counts for driver and executors, but given that docker (at least)\nallows forwarding port ranges, we can probably live without that for now.\n\nBecause of the nature of the feature it's kinda hard to add unit tests;\nI just added a simple one to make sure the configuration works.\n\nThis was tested with a docker image running spark-shell with the following\ncommand:\n\n docker blah blah blah \\\n   -p 38000-38100:38000-38100 \\\n   [image] \\\n   spark-shell \\\n     --num-executors 3 \\\n     --conf spark.shuffle.service.enabled=false \\\n     --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=false \\\n     --conf spark.driver.host=[host's address] \\\n     --conf spark.driver.port=38000 \\\n     --conf spark.driver.blockManager.port=38020 \\\n     --conf spark.ui.port=38040\n\nRunning on YARN; verified the driver works, executors start up and listen\non ephemeral ports (instead of using the driver's config), and that caching\nand shuffling (without the shuffle service) works. Clicked through the UI\nto make sure all pages (including executor thread dumps) worked. Also tested\napps without docker, and ran unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdding option in spark-submit to allow overriding the default IvySettings used to resolve artifacts as part of the Spark Packages functionality.  This will allow all artifact resolution to go through a central managed repository, such as Nexus or Artifactory, where site admins can better approve and control what is used with Spark apps.\r\n\r\nThis change restructures the creation of the IvySettings object in two distinct ways.  First, if the `spark.ivy.settings` option is not defined then `buildIvySettings` will create a default settings instance, as before, with defined repositories (Maven Central) included.  Second, if the option is defined, the ivy settings file will be loaded from the given path and only repositories defined within will be used for artifact resolution.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests for default behaviour, Manual tests that load a ivysettings.xml file with local and Nexus repositories defined.  Added new test to load a simple Ivy settings file with a local filesystem resolver.\r\n","created_at":"2016-09-16T21:55:44Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T20:01:40Z","closed_at":"2017-01-11T20:00:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65ef28c8c141457516fcaae70aab5176c3023c66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15119/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15119/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15119/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/532e744eff04ce377ceae903c3d916091f551216","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:spark-custom-IvySettings","ref":"spark-custom-IvySettings","sha":"532e744eff04ce377ceae903c3d916091f551216","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen use PeriodicGraphCheckpointer to persist graph, sometimes the edges isn't persisted. As currently only when vertices's storage level is none, graph is persisted. However there is a chance vertices's storage level is not none while edges's is none. Eg. graph created by a outerJoinVertices operation, vertices is automatically cached while edges is not. In this way, edges will not be persisted if we use PeriodicGraphCheckpointer do persist. We need separately check edges's storage level and persisted it if it's none.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDocker tests are using older version  of jersey jars (1.19),  which was used in older releases of spark.  In 2.0 releases Spark was upgraded to use 2.x verison of Jersey. After  upgrade to new versions, docker tests  are  failing with AbstractMethodError.  Now that spark is upgraded  to 2.x jersey version, using of  shaded docker jars  may not be required any more.  Removed the exclusions/overrides of jersey related classes from pom file, and changed the docker-client to use regular jar instead of shaded one. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested  using existing  docker-integration-tests\n","created_at":"2016-09-15T21:42:41Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T16:58:57Z","closed_at":"2016-09-19T16:58:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8f1f0040e58d6b0d20614b58bdc572d39c3157e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15114/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15114/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15114/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f159d8226ca0db7b9768c99639b1e06a7738ec6d","head":{"label":"sureshthalamati:docker_testfix-spark-17473","ref":"docker_testfix-spark-17473","sha":"f159d8226ca0db7b9768c99639b1e06a7738ec6d","user":{"login":"sureshthalamati","id":13815184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13815184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40833027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDgzMzAyNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sureshthalamati/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sureshthalamati","id":13815184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODE1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13815184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshthalamati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sureshthalamati/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn PySpark, if params are set with a value of `None` it will get converted by Py4J to a typed value and usually result in an error.  For the case of string params, it will assign them a `null` value and lead to a `java.lang.NullPointerException`.  From the user perspective, this is not the expected outcome and can be confusing.  \n\nThis change causes PySpark to not set Params with a value of `None`, and they will be treated the same as not being set.  If a Param is already set, then attempting to set a value of `None` will have no effect.  This is mostly useful for a user that could be automating Param settings or wrapping classes that use Params.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded new unit tests for setting a Param to `None` and ran existing PySpark-ml tests.\n","created_at":"2016-09-15T20:19:27Z","updated_at":"2018-04-17T17:33:14Z","closed_at":"2018-04-17T17:33:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92f270c8ba65449d8e421650c8ef94a78d415461","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15113/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15113/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15113/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/53bd9d2e6c896fa48284ca7b79189e6ae3545f83","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:pyspark-param-none-SPARK-17508","ref":"pyspark-param-none-SPARK-17508","sha":"53bd9d2e6c896fa48284ca7b79189e6ae3545f83","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFollowing https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14969 for some reason the MiMa excludes weren't complete, but still passed the PR builder. This adds 3 more excludes from https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.2/1749/consoleFull\n\nIt also moves the excludes to their own Seq in the build, as they probably should have been.\nEven though this is merged to 2.1.x only / master, I left the exclude in for 2.0.x in case we back port. It's a private API so is always a false positive.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, the SQL metrics looks like `number of rows: 111111111111`, it's very hard to read how large the number is. So a separator was added by #12425, but removed by #14142, because the separator is weird in some locales (for example, pl_PL), this PR will add that back, but always use \",\" as the separator, since the SQL UI are all in English.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n![metrics](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40902/14573908/21ad2f00-030d-11e6-9e2c-c544f30039ea.png)\n","created_at":"2016-09-14T23:37:26Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T18:51:23Z","closed_at":"2016-09-19T18:51:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"116d4403c38a46fbcda85c1d48c6ce8090e2f308","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15106/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15106/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15106/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11a989eacf26ebf0ae3710fa23ef3a63dc618b51","head":{"label":"davies:metric_sep","ref":"metric_sep","sha":"11a989eacf26ebf0ae3710fa23ef3a63dc618b51","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pull request changes the behavior of `Word2VecModel.findSynonyms` so that it will not spuriously reject the best match when invoked with a vector that does not correspond to a word in the model's vocabulary.  Instead of blindly discarding the best match, the changed implementation discards a match that corresponds to the query word (in cases where `findSynonyms` is invoked with a word) or that has an identical angle to the query vector.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI added a test to `Word2VecSuite` to ensure that the word with the most similar vector from a supplied vector would not be spuriously rejected.\n","created_at":"2016-09-14T22:33:19Z","updated_at":"2016-09-17T11:52:05Z","closed_at":"2016-09-17T11:52:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c1fc288719d17184b3d55b03c8b85c196db742e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15105/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15105/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15105/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/624c0f8b1ad78f98cabcc51a1ed7a94f5f20a25a","head":{"label":"willb:fix/findSynonyms","ref":"fix/findSynonyms","sha":"624c0f8b1ad78f98cabcc51a1ed7a94f5f20a25a","user":{"login":"willb","id":1161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb","html_url":"https://github.com/willb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17481019,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQ4MTAxOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"willb/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"willb","id":1161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb","html_url":"https://github.com/willb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/willb/spark","description":"Mirror

(#9610) modified shuffle writers to first stage their data to a temporary file in the same directory as the final destination file and then to atomically rename this temporary file at the end of the write job. However, this change introduced the potential for the temporary output file to be leaked if an exception occurs during the write because the shuffle writers' existing error cleanup code doesn't handle deletion of the temp file.\n\nThis patch avoids this potential cause of disk-space leaks by adding `finally` blocks to ensure that temp files are always deleted if they haven't been renamed.\n","created_at":"2016-09-14T21:53:52Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T18:46:46Z","closed_at":"2016-09-15T18:25:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"233a67e4b27b51cdb72508b85344a19ccdab8b86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15104/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15104/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15104/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82bceb3cd4ff7e42bc49cc3e0e96db5099a9ede7","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:cleanup-tmp-data-file-in-shuffle-writer","ref":"cleanup-tmp-data-file-in-shuffle-writer","sha":"82bceb3cd4ff7e42bc49cc3e0e96db5099a9ede7","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds a new project `external/kafka-0-10-sql` for Structured Streaming Kafka source.\n\nIt's based on the design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19t2rWe51x7tq2e5AOfrsM9qb8_m7BRuv9fel9i0PqR8/edit?usp=sharing\n\n@tdas did most of work and part of them was inspired by @koeninger's work.\n### Introduction\n\nThe Kafka source is a structured streaming data source to poll data from Kafka. The schema of reading data is as follows:\n\n| Column | Type |\n| --- | --- |\n| key | binary |\n| value | binary |\n| topic | string |\n| partition | int |\n| offset | long |\n| timestamp | long |\n| timestampType | int |\n\nThe source can deal with deleting topics. However, the user should make sure there is no Spark job processing the data when deleting a topic.\n### Configuration\n\nThe user can use `DataStreamReader.option` to set the following configurations.\n\n| Kafka Source's options | value | default | meaning |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| startingOffset | [\"earliest\", \"latest\"] | \"latest\" | The start point when a query is started, either \"earliest\" which is from the earliest offset, or \"latest\" which is just from the latest offset. Note: This only applies when a new Streaming query is started, and that resuming will always pick up from where the query left off. |\n| failOnDataLost | [true, false] | true | Whether to fail the query when it's possible that data is lost (e.g., topics are deleted, or offsets are out of range). This may be a false alarm. You can disable it when it doesn't work as you expected. |\n| subscribe | A comma-separated list of topics | (none) | The topic list to subscribe. Only one of \"subscribe\" and \"subscribeParttern\" options can be specified for Kafka source. |\n| subscribePattern | Java regex string | (none) | The pattern used to subscribe the topic. Only one of \"subscribe\" and \"subscribeParttern\" options can be specified for Kafka source. |\n| kafka.consumer.poll.timeoutMs | long | 512 | The timeout in milliseconds to poll data from Kafka in executors |\n| fetchOffset.numRetries | int | 3 | Number of times to retry before giving up fatch Kafka latest offsets. |\n| fetchOffset.retryIntervalMs | long | 10 | milliseconds to wait before retrying to fetch Kafka offsets |\n\nKafka's own configurations can be set via `DataStreamReader.option` with `kafka.` prefix, e.g, `stream.option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"host:port\")`\n### Usage\n- Subscribe to 1 topic\n\n``` Scala\nspark\n  .readStream\n  .format(\"kafka\")\n  .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"host:port\")\n  .option(\"subscribe\", \"topic1\")\n  .load()\n```\n- Subscribe to multiple topics\n\n``` Scala\nspark\n  .readStream\n  .format(\"kafka\")\n  .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"host:port\")\n  .option(\"subscribe\", \"topic1,topic2\")\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes an issue with aggregates that have an empty input, and use a literals as their grouping keys. These aggregates are currently interpreted as aggregates **without** grouping keys, this triggers the ungrouped code path (which aways returns a single row).\n\nThis PR fixes the `RemoveLiteralFromGroupExpressions` optimizer rule, which changes the semantics of the Aggregate by eliminating all literal grouping keys.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded tests to `SQLQueryTestSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-09-14T20:55:46Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T18:26:04Z","closed_at":"2016-09-15T18:26:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f364393f7d6e222018dfb2fef0682f05775a313d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15101/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15101/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15101/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6c4b9c907de716b16212622cbff0575f04fc4e3","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-17114-3","ref":"SPARK-17114-3","sha":"e6c4b9c907de716b16212622cbff0575f04fc4e3","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn `SessionCatalog`, we have several operations(`tableExists`, `dropTable`, `loopupRelation`, etc) that handle both temp views and metastore tables/views. This brings some bugs to DDL commands that want to handle temp view only or metastore table/view only. These bugs are:\n1. `CREATE TABLE USING` will fail if a same-name temp view exists\n2. `Catalog.dropTempView`will un-cache and drop metastore table if a same-name table exists\n3. `saveAsTable` will

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nwhen r-side param is a zero array, because it doesn't contains type info,\njava-side cannot generate the correct array object.\n\nnow I think about two ways: \n### Discuss\n1. java-side regard the r-side passed zero array as `null`, but in this way we cannot distinguish `null` value and zero array for this param. \n2. when java-side read the zero array param passed from r-side, we check the java-side interface's param type, so that we can generate the correct zero array object. But it will complicate the code.\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`spark.read.parquet(\"parquet/dir\")` would issue a spark job to read parquet schema. When `spark.sql.parquet.mergeSchema` are set to false (the default value), there is often only one file to read, so there is no need to issue a spark job to do it. In this case, we can read it from driver directly instead of issuing a spark job. This could reduce the infer schema latency from several hundreds milliseconds to around ten milliseconds in my environment.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmanually tested\n","created_at":"2016-09-14T15:12:01Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T07:47:24Z","closed_at":"2016-09-15T07:47:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2305f68e3deaabade25849957276227496f4df5f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15096/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15096/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15096/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9b610c22e8fedbf61b98943ca9a8b3ba08320c94","head":{"label":"yangw1234:mergeSchema_2.0","ref":"mergeSchema_2.0","sha":"9b610c22e8fedbf61b98943ca9a8b3ba08320c94","user":{"login":"yangw1234","id":10561966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTYxOTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10561966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234","html_url":"https://github.com/yangw1234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47666092,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzY2NjA5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"yangw1234/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yangw1234","id":10561966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTYxOTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10561966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234","html_url":"https://github.com/yangw1234","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangw1234/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yangw1234/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes all the instances which was fixed in the previous PR.\n\nTo make sure, I manually debugged and also checked the Scala source. `length` in [LinearSeqOptimized.scala#L49-L57](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/library/scala/collection/LinearSeqOptimized.scala#L49-L57) is O(n). Also, `size` calls `length` via [SeqLike.scala#L106](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/library/scala/collection/SeqLike.scala#L106).\n\nFor debugging, I have created these as below:\n\n``` scala\nArrayBuffer(1, 2, 3)\nArray(1, 2, 3)\nList(1, 2, 3)\nSeq(1, 2, 3)\n```\n\nand then called `size` and `length` for each to debug.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI ran the bash as below on Mac\n\n``` bash\nfind . -name *.scala -type f -exec grep -il \"while (.*\\\\.length)\" {} \\; | grep \"src/main\"\nfind . -name *.scala -type f -exec grep -il \"while (.*\\\\.size)\" {} \\; | grep \"src/main\"\n```\n\nand then checked

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nGenerate basic column statistics for all the atomic types:\n- numeric types: max, min, num of nulls, ndv (number of distinct values)\n- date/timestamp types: they are also represented as numbers internally, so they have the same stats as above.\n- string: avg length, max length, num of nulls, ndv\n- binary: avg length, max length, num of nulls\n- boolean: num of nulls, num of trues, num of falsies\n\nAlso support storing and loading these statistics.\n\nOne thing to notice:\nWe support analyzing columns independently, e.g.:\nsql1: `ANALYZE TABLE src COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR COLUMNS key;`\nsql2: `ANALYZE TABLE src COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR COLUMNS value;`\nwhen running sql2 to collect column stats for `value`, we don’t remove stats of columns `key` which are analyzed in sql1 and not in sql2. As a result, **users need to guarantee consistency** between sql1 and sql2. If the table has been changed before sql2, users should re-analyze column `key` when they want to analyze column `value`:\n`ANALYZE TABLE src COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR COLUMNS key, value;`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadd unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen execute a Python UDF, we buffer the input row into as queue, then pull them out to join with the result from Python UDF. In the case that Python UDF is slow or the input row is too wide, we could ran out of memory because of the queue. Since we can't flush all the buffers (sockets) between JVM and Python process from JVM side, we can't limit the rows in the queue, otherwise it could deadlock.\n\nThis PR will manage the memory used by the queue, spill that into disk when there is no enough memory (also release the memory and disk space as soon as possible). \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests. Also manually ran a workload with large input row and slow python UDF (with  large broadcast) like this:\n\n```\nb = range(1<<24)\nadd = udf(lambda x: x + len(b), IntegerType())\ndf = sqlContext.range(1, 1<<26, 1, 4)\nprint df.select(df.id, lit(\"adf\"*10000).alias(\"s\"), add(df.id).alias(\"add\")).groupBy(length(\"s\")).sum().collect()\n```\n\nIt ran out of memory (hang because of full GC) before the patch, ran smoothly after the patch.\n","created_at":"2016-09-13T23:56:51Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T20:47:08Z","closed_at":"2016-10-07T20:47:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db971680554cd689cdc656daac6dcdb5d8297be4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15089/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15089/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15089/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ca607e038259cff7d50b732801cfc5144dedb6d1","head":{"label":"davies:spill_udf","ref":"spill_udf","sha":"ca607e038259cff7d50b732801cfc5144dedb6d1","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis adds information to the web UI thread dump page about the JVM locks\nheld by threads and the locks that threads are blocked waiting to\nacquire. This should help find cases where lock contention is causing\nSpark applications to run slowly.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by applying this patch and viewing the change in the web UI.\n\n![thread-lock-info](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/87915/18493057/6e5da870-79c3-11e6-8c20-f54c18a37544.png)\n\nAdditions:\n- A \"Thread Locking\" column with the locks held by the thread or that are blocking the thread\n- Links from the a blocked thread to the thread holding the lock\n- Stack frames show where threads are inside `synchronized` blocks, \"holding

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIf a user provides listeners inside the Hive Conf, the configuration for these listeners are passed to the Hive Execution Client as well. This may cause issues for two reasons:\n1. The Execution Client will actually generate garbage\n2. The listener class needs to be both in the Spark Classpath and Hive Classpath\n\nThis PR empties the listener configurations in HiveUtils.newTemporaryConfiguration so that the execution client will not contain the listener confs, but the metadata client will.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIf a BlockManager `put()` call failed after the BlockManagerMaster was notified of a block's availability then incomplete cleanup logic in a `finally` block would never send a second block status method to inform the master of the block's unavailability. This, in turn, leads to fetch failures and used to be capable of causing complete job failures before #15037 was fixed.\n\nThis patch addresses this issue via multiple small changes:\n- The `finally` block now calls `removeBlockInternal` when cleaning up from a failed `put()`; in addition to removing the `BlockInfo` entry (which was _all_ that the old cleanup logic did), this code (redundantly) tries to remove the block from the memory and disk stores (as an added layer of defense against bugs lower down in the stack) and optionally notifies the master of block removal (which now happens during exception-triggered cleanup).\n- When a BlockManager receives a request for a block that it does not have it will now notify the master to update its block locations. This ensures that bad metadata pointing to non-existent blocks will eventually be fixed. Note that I could have implemented this logic in the block manager client (rather than in the remote server), but that would introduce the problem of distinguishing between transient and permanent failures; on the server, however, we know definitively that the block isn't present.\n- Catch `NonFatal` instead of `Exception` to avoid swallowing `InterruptedException`s thrown from synchronous block replication calls.\n\nThis patch depends upon the refactorings in #15036, so that other patch will also have to be backported when backporting this fix.\n\nFor more background on this issue, including example logs from a real production failure, see [SPARK-17484](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17484).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTwo new regression tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd a clearUntil() method on BitSet (adapted from the pre-existing setUntil() method).\nUse this method to clear the subset of the BitSet which needs to be used during merge joins.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\ndev/run-tests, as well as performance tests on skewed data as described in jira.\n\nI expect there to be a small local performance hit using BitSet.clearUntil rather than BitSet.clear for normally shaped (unskewed) joins (additional read on the last long).  This is expected to be de-minimis and was not specifically tested.\n","created_at":"2016-09-13T19:06:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-17T15:24:31Z","closed_at":"2016-09-17T15:24:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"964e34ff84819a764511f193d123e7ed1a0e903b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ff15b2b496a519e95d8d59bb2fb87cd88bddf37d","head":{"label":"davidnavas:bitSet","ref":"bitSet","sha":"ff15b2b496a519e95d8d59bb2fb87cd88bddf37d","user":{"login":"davidnavas","id":9660924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjA5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9660924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas","html_url":"https://github.com/davidnavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34281011,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDI4MTAxMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davidnavas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davidnavas","id":9660924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjA5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9660924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas","html_url":"https://github.com/davidnavas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidnavas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davidnavas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor performance reasons, `UnsafeRow.getString`, `getStruct`, etc. return a \"pointer\" that points to a memory region of this unsafe row. This makes the unsafe projection a little dangerous, because all of its output rows share one instance.\n\nWhen we implement SQL operators, we should be careful to not cache the input rows because they may be produced by unsafe projection from child operator and thus its content may change overtime.\n\nHowever, `GenerateMutableProjection` breaks this and may cache the content in input rows. The sort based aggregate use it, but this bug is not exposed because sort based aggregate always do an extra projection for the input row.\n\nThis PR fixes the bug of `GenerateMutableProjection` and some related bugs in complex data copy, and remove the useless projection in sort based aggregate.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nsome new tests.\n","created_at":"2016-09-13T17:54:51Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T02:50:52Z","closed_at":"2017-06-14T02:50:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0569c5641d4d7d926a7260823d459cb5d6874640","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15082/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15082/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15082/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c56de6da72c18b2cd1f65eed956cdee89371b075","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:agg-bug","ref":"agg-bug","sha":"c56de6da72c18b2cd1f65eed956cdee89371b075","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pull request removes the SparkContext.clearFiles() method from the PySpark API as the method was removed from the Scala API in 8ce645d4eeda203cf5e100c4bdba2d71edd44e6a. Using that method in PySpark leads to an exception as PySpark tries to call the non-existent method on the JVM side.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests (though none of them tested this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, if we build Spark, it will generate a `spark-version-info.properties` and merged into `spark-core_2.11-*.jar`. However, the script `build/spark-build-info` which generates this file can only be executed with bash environment.\nWithout this file, errors like below will happen when submitting Spark application, which break the whole submitting phrase at beginning.\n\n``` Java\nRROR ApplicationMaster: Uncaught exception: \norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Exception thrown in awaitResult: \n    at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes an issue with aggregates that have an empty input, and use a literals as their grouping keys. These aggregates are currently interpreted as aggregates **without** grouping keys, this triggers the ungrouped code path (which aways returns a single row).\n\nThis PR fixes this by adding a `isGrouped` flag to `Aggregate`. This flag is inferred when the `Aggregate` is created, but is kept when we change the `Aggregate`s grouping expressions.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes set operations in `DataFrame` to be performed fine without exceptions when the types are non-scala native types. (e.g, `TimestampType`, `DateType` and `DecimalType`). \n\nThe problem is, it seems set operations such as `union`, `intersect` and `except` uses the encoder belonging to the `Dataset` in caller.\n\nSo, `Dataset` of the caller holds `ExpressionEncoder[Row]` as it is when the set operations are performed. However, the return types can be actually widen. So, we should use `ExpressionEncoder[Row]` constructed from executed plan rather than using existing one. Otherwise, this will generate some codes wrongly via `StaticInvoke`.\n\nRunning the codes below:\n\n``` scala\nval dates = Seq(\n  (new Date(0), BigDecimal.valueOf(1), new Timestamp(2)),\n  (new Date(3), BigDecimal.valueOf(4), new Timestamp(5))\n).toDF(\"date\", \"timestamp\", \"decimal\")\n\nval widenTypedRows = Seq(\n  (new Timestamp(2), 10.5D, \"string\")\n).toDF(\"date\", \"timestamp\", \"decimal\")\n\nval results = dates.union(widenTypedRows).collect()\nresults.foreach(println)\n```\n\nprints below:\n\n**Before**\n\n``` java\n23:08:54.490 ERROR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor current `BroadcastHashJoinExec`, we generate join code for key is not unique like this: \n\n```\nwhile (matches.hasnext) {\n    matched = matches.next\n    check and read stream side row fields\n    check and read build side row fieldes\n    reset result row\n    write stream side row fields to result row\n    write build side row fields to result row\n    append(result row)\n}\n```\n\nFor some cases, we don't need to check/read/write the steam side repeatedly in such while circle, e.g. `Inner Join with BuildRight`, or `BuildLeft &&  all left side fields are fixed length` and so on. we may generate the code as below:\n\n```\ncheck and read stream side row fields\nreset result row\nwrite stream side row fields to result row\nwhile (matches.hasnext)\n{\n    matched = matches.next\n    check and read build side row fieldes\n    write build side row fields to result row\n    append(result row)\n}\n```\n## How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn PySpark, `df.take(1)` runs a single-stage job which computes only one partition of the DataFrame, while `df.limit(1).collect()` computes all partitions and runs a two-stage job. This difference in performance is confusing.\n\nThe reason why `limit(1).collect()` is so much slower is that `collect()` internally maps to `df.rdd.<some-pyspark-conversions>.toLocalIterator`, which causes Spark SQL to build a query where a global limit appears in the middle of the plan; this, in turn, ends up being executed inefficiently because limits in the middle of plans are now implemented by repartitioning to a single task rather than by running a `take()` job on the driver (this was done in #7334, a patch which was a prerequisite to allowing partition-local limits to be pushed beneath unions, etc.).\n\nIn order to fix this performance problem I think that we should generalize the fix from SPARK-10731 / #8876 so that `DataFrame.collect()` also delegates to the Scala implementation and shares the same performance properties. This patch modifies `DataFrame.collect()` to first collect all results to the driver and then pass them to Python, allowing this query to be planned using Spark's `CollectLimit` optimizations.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a regression test in `sql/tests.py` which asserts that the expected number of jobs, stages, and tasks are run for both queries.\n","created_at":"2016-09-13T00:55:59Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T17:36:08Z","closed_at":"2016-09-14T17:12:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e9cce8e622ba47909817accb0f309058096887b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15068/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15068/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15068/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/07e4c8f6b87a8f03599c05bd0c504521c63d5ef0","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:pyspark-collect-limit","ref":"pyspark-collect-limit","sha":"07e4c8f6b87a8f03599c05bd0c504521c63d5ef0","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUse `AtomicXXX.lazySet` to update a metric value which is much cheaper than writing a volatile value. The eventually set should be enough for metrics. Without them, the worse case is the user cannot see any metric updates on UI until a task finishes.\n\nUnfortunately, there will be a performance regression comparing to Spark 2.0.0. Note: in Spark 1.6, accumulators have a volatile value, so there should not be any performance regression comparing to 1.6.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis method gets a type's primary constructor and fills in type parameters with concrete types. For example, `MapPartitions[T, U] -> MapPartitions[Int, String]`. This Substitution fails when the actual type args are empty because they are still unknown. Instead, when there are no resolved types to subsitute, this returns the original args with unresolved type parameters.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis doesn't affect substitutions where the type args are determined. This fixes our case where the actual type args are empty and our job runs

patch makes a handful of post-Spark-2.0 MiMa exclusion and build updates. It should be merged to master and a subset of it should be picked into branch-2.0 in order to test Spark 2.0.1-SNAPSHOT.\n- Remove the `sketch`, `mllibLocal`, and `streamingKafka010` from the list of excluded subprojects so that MiMa checks them.\n- Remove now-unnecessary special-case handling of the Kafka 0.8 artifact in `mimaSettings`.\n- Move the exclusion added in SPARK-14743 from `v20excludes` to `v21excludes`, since that patch was only merged into master and not branch-2.0.\n- Add exclusions for an API change introduced by SPARK-17096 / #14675.\n- Add missing exclusions for the `o.a.spark.internal` and `o.a.spark.sql.internal` packages.\n","created_at":"2016-09-12T17:22:02Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T22:35:34Z","closed_at":"2016-09-12T22:26:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22908969a9e6c8532753084bb7d945a47d03ffa6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15061/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15061/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15061/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1224e758fc4cf69e27f013615d52b5c96696506b","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:post-2.0-mima-changes","ref":"post-2.0-mima-changes","sha":"1224e758fc4cf69e27f013615d52b5c96696506b","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

to storage memory cache. The problem is that when the input RDD is too big for caching in memory, the temporary unrolling memory SizeTrackingVector is not garbage collected in time. As SizeTrackingVector can occupy all available storage memory, it may cause the executor JVM to run out of memory quickly.\n\nMore info can be found at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n- When the permanent tables/views do not exist but the temporary view exists, the expected error should be `NoSuchTableException` for partition-related ALTER TABLE commands. However, it always reports a confusing error message. For example, \n\n```\nPartition spec is invalid. The spec (a, b) must match the partition spec () defined in table '`testview`';\n```\n- When the permanent tables/views do not exist but the temporary view exists, the expected error should be `NoSuchTableException` for `ALTER TABLE ... UNSET TBLPROPERTIES`. However, it reports a missing table property. For example, \n\n```\nAttempted to unset non-existent property 'p' in table '`testView`';\n```\n- When `ANALYZE TABLE` is called on a view or a temporary view, we should issue an error message. However, it reports a strange error:\n\n```\nANALYZE TABLE is not supported for Project\n```\n- When inserting into a temporary view that is generated from `Range`, we will get the following error message:\n\n```\nassertion failed: No plan for 'InsertIntoTable Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=Some(1)), false, false\n+- Project [1 AS 1#20]\n   +- OneRowRelation$\n```\n\nThis PR is to fix the above four issues.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded multiple test cases\n","created_at":"2016-09-12T06:24:28Z","updated_at":"2016-09-20T14:16:19Z","closed_at":"2016-09-20T12:14:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"efaa7fce422c2652e0162cf264830da92582e915","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15054/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15054/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15054/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ee3096ca6bc8b3fb8962694169d12c56ca9aa236","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:tempViewDDL","ref":"tempViewDDL","sha":"ee3096ca6bc8b3fb8962694169d12c56ca9aa236","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a concern that Spark-side codegen row-by-row filtering might be faster than Parquet's one in general due to type-boxing and additional fuction calls which Spark's one tries to avoid.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR adds an option to disable/enable record-by-record filtering in Parquet side.\r\n\r\nIt sets the default to `false` to take the advantage of the improvement.\r\n\r\nThis was also discussed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14671.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually benchmarks were performed. I generated a billion (1,000,000,000) records and tested equality comparison concatenated with `OR`. This filter combinations were made from 5 to 30. \r\n\r\nIt seem indeed Spark-filtering is faster in the test case and the gap increased as the filter tree becomes larger.\r\n\r\nThe details are as below:\r\n\r\n**Code**\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\ntest(\"Parquet-side filter vs Spark-side filter - record by record\") {\r\n  withTempPath { path =>\r\n    val N = 1000 * 1000 * 1000\r\n    val df = spark.range(N).toDF(\"a\")\r\n    df.write.parquet(path.getAbsolutePath)\r\n\r\n    val benchmark = new Benchmark(\"Parquet-side vs Spark-side\", N)\r\n    Seq(5, 10, 20, 30).foreach { num =>\r\n      val filterExpr = (0 to num).map(i => s\"a = $i\").mkString(\" OR \")\r\n\r\n      benchmark.addCase(s\"Parquet-side filter - number of filters [$num]\", 3) { _ =>\r\n        withSQLConf(SQLConf.PARQUET_VECTORIZED_READER_ENABLED.key -> false.toString,\r\n          SQLConf.PARQUET_RECORD_FILTER_ENABLED.key -> true.toString) {\r\n\r\n          // We should strip Spark-side filter to compare correctly.\r\n          stripSparkFilter(\r\n            spark.read.parquet(path.getAbsolutePath).filter(filterExpr)).count()\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      benchmark.addCase(s\"Spark-side filter - number of filters [$num]\", 3) { _ =>\r\n        withSQLConf(SQLConf.PARQUET_VECTORIZED_READER_ENABLED.key -> false.toString,\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs explained in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14797:\n\n> Some analyzer rules have assumptions on logical plans, optimizer may break these assumption, we should not pass an optimized query plan into QueryExecution (will be analyzed again), otherwise we may some weird bugs.\n> For example, we have a rule for decimal calculation to promote the precision before binary operations, use PromotePrecision as placeholder to indicate that this rule should not apply twice. But a Optimizer rule will remove this placeholder, that break the assumption, then the rule applied twice, cause wrong result.\n\nWe should not optimize the query in CTAS more than once. For example, \n\n``` Scala\nspark.range(99, 101).createOrReplaceTempView(\"tab1\")\nval sqlStmt = \"SELECT id, cast(id as long) * cast('1.0' as decimal(38, 18)) as num FROM tab1\"\nsql(s\"CREATE TABLE tab2 USING PARQUET AS $sqlStmt\")\ncheckAnswer(spark.table(\"tab2\"), sql(sqlStmt))\n```\n\nBefore this PR, the results do not match\n\n```\n== Results ==\n!== Correct Answer - 2 ==       == Spark Answer - 2 ==\n![100,100.000000000000000000]   [100,null]\n [99,99.000000000000000000]     [99,99.000000000000000000]\n```\n\nAfter this PR, the results match.\n\n```\n+---+----------------------+\n|id |num                   |\n+---+----------------------+\n|99 |99.000000000000000000 |\n|100|100.000000000000000000|\n+---+----------------------+\n```\n\nIn this PR, we do not treat the `query` in CTAS as a child. Thus, the `query` will not be optimized when optimizing CTAS statement. However, we still need to analyze it for normalizing and verifying the CTAS in the Analyzer. Thus, we do it in the analyzer rule `PreprocessDDL`, because so far only this rule needs the analyzed plan of the `query`.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17495\n\nSpark internally uses Murmur3Hash for partitioning. This is different from the one used by Hive. For queries which use bucketing this leads to different results if one tries the same query on both engines. For us, we want users to have backward compatibility to that one can switch parts of applications across the engines without observing regressions.\n\nThis PR includes `HiveHash`, `HiveHashFunction`, `HiveHasher` which mimics Hive's hashing at https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/objectinspector/ObjectInspectorUtils.java#L638\n\nI am intentionally not introducing any usages of this hash function in rest of the code to keep this PR small. My eventual goal is to have Hive bucketing support in Spark. Once this PR gets in, I will make hash function pluggable in relevant areas (eg. `HashPartitioning`'s `partitionIdExpression` has Murmur3 hardcoded : https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/plans/physical/partitioning.scala#L265)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor data sources without extending `SchemaRelationProvider`, we expect users to not specify schemas when they creating tables. If the schema is input from users, an exception is issued. \n\nSince Spark 2.1, for any data source, to avoid infer the schema every time, we store the schema in the metastore catalog. Thus, when reading a cataloged data source table, the schema could be read from metastore catalog. In this case, we also got an exception. For example, \n\n``` Scala\nsql(\n  s\"\"\"\n     |CREATE TABLE relationProvierWithSchema\n     |USING org.apache.spark.sql.sources.SimpleScanSource\n     |OPTIONS (\n     |  From '1',\n     |  To '10'\n     |)\n   \"\"\".stripMargin)\nspark.table(tableName).show()\n```\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.sources.SimpleScanSource does not allow user-specified schemas.;\n```\n\nThis PR is to fix the above issue. When building a data source, we introduce a flag `isSchemaFromUsers` to indicate whether the schema is really input from users. If true, we issue an exception. Otherwise, we will call the `createRelation` of `RelationProvider` to generate the `BaseRelation`, in which it contains the actual schema.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a few cases.\n","created_at":"2016-09-10T16:38:50Z","updated_at":"2016-09-22T05:21:29Z","closed_at":"2016-09-22T05:21:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aae09c148d1fceee80421e64af3135eac880a053","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15046/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15046/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15046/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7a807384b5814b7458ff534ff6146b842f00a8d4","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:tempViewCases","ref":"tempViewCases","sha":"7a807384b5814b7458ff534ff6146b842f00a8d4","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWaiting for merging #13680\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes `SerializeFromObject()` for an primitive array. This is derived from #13758 to address one of problems by using a simple way in #13758.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation always generates `GenericArrayData` from `SerializeFromObject()` for any type of an array in a logical plan. This involves a boxing at a constructor of `GenericArrayData` when `SerializedFromObject()` has an primitive array.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables to generate `UnsafeArrayData` from `SerializeFromObject()` for a primitive array. It can avoid boxing to create an instance of `ArrayData` in the generated code by Catalyst.\r\n\r\nThis PR also generate `UnsafeArrayData` in a case for `RowEncoder.serializeFor` or `CatalystTypeConverters.createToCatalystConverter`.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvement of `SerializeFromObject()` is up to 2.0x\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_91-b14 on Linux

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`MemoryStore.putIteratorAsBytes()` may silently lose values when used with `KryoSerializer` because it does not properly close the serialization stream before attempting to deserialize the already-serialized values, which may cause values buffered in Kryo's internal buffers to not be read.\n\nThis is the root cause behind a user-reported \"wrong answer\" bug in PySpark caching reported by @bennoleslie on the Spark user mailing list in a thread titled \"pyspark persist MEMORY_ONLY vs MEMORY_AND_DISK\". Due to Spark 2.0's automatic use of KryoSerializer for \"safe\" types (such as byte arrays, primitives, etc.) this misuse of serializers manifested itself as silent data corruption rather than a StreamCorrupted error (which you might get from JavaSerializer). \n\nThe minimal fix, implemented here, is to close the serialization stream before attempting to deserialize written values. In addition, this patch adds several additional assertions / precondition checks to prevent misuse of `PartiallySerializedBlock` and `ChunkedByteBufferOutputStream`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe original bug was masked by an invalid assert in the memory store test cases: the old assert compared two results record-by-record with `zip` but didn't first check that the lengths of the two collections were equal, causing missing records to go unnoticed. The updated test case reproduced this bug.\n\nIn addition, I added a new `PartiallySerializedBlockSuite` to unit test that component.\n","created_at":"2016-09-10T06:55:03Z","updated_at":"2016-09-17T18:48:45Z","closed_at":"2016-09-17T18:48:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfc5f6e9a81fe2b9f4721b940c6c68883ea16df7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15043/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15043/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15043/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d70774e1db04edb46b312efc4b1646d7201fb03","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:partially-serialized-block-values-iterator-bugfix","ref":"partially-serialized-block-values-iterator-bugfix","sha":"0d70774e1db04edb46b312efc4b1646d7201fb03","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI am looking for early feedback about this change wrt approach.\n\nHere is what this PR contains:\n- Introduced `BucketingInfoExtractor` which has functions for \n  - extract bucket id from a given filename\n  - given bucket id and other info, generate the filename\n- `BucketingInfoExtractor` is a part of `BucketSpec` since the same session can process native Spark tables and pure Hive tables\n- Provided a default impl which adheres with Spark's current naming scheme\n- All codepaths which write a file now use the `BucketingInfoExtractor` to get a filename as per the bucketing scheme\n\nTODO\n- Get rid of `BucketingUtils` completely\n- Introduce impl for Hive\n- Add tests\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTODO\n","created_at":"2016-09-10T03:24:16Z","updated_at":"2017-01-22T06:27:00Z","closed_at":"2017-01-22T06:27:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1cad7282d119ae99d00032cd76d251b3591af98b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fcf37f7d89b16e8bb4589e519a516b351eb650b8","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:custom_bucketing","ref":"custom_bucketing","sha":"fcf37f7d89b16e8bb4589e519a516b351eb650b8","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn Spark's `RDD.getOrCompute` we first try to read a local copy of a cached RDD block, then a remote copy, and only fall back to recomputing the block if no cached copy (local or remote) can be read. This logic works correctly in the case where no remote copies of the block exist, but if there _are_ remote copies and reads of those copies fail (due to network issues or internal Spark bugs) then the BlockManager will throw a `BlockFetchException` that will fail the task (and which could possibly fail the whole job if the read failures keep occurring).\n\nIn the cases of TorrentBroadcast and task result fetching we really do want to fail the entire job in case no remote blocks can be fetched, but this logic is inappropriate for reads of cached RDD blocks because those can/should be recomputed in case cached blocks are unavailable.\n\nTherefore, I think that the `BlockManager.getRemoteBytes()` method should never throw on remote fetch errors and, instead, should handle failures by returning `None`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nBlock manager changes should be covered by modified tests in `BlockManagerSuite`: the old tests expected exceptions to be thrown on failed remote reads, while the modified tests now expect `None` to be returned from the `getRemote*` method.\n\nI also manually inspected all usages of `BlockManager.getRemoteValues()`, `getRemoteBytes()`, and `get()` to verify that they correctly pattern-match on the result and handle `None`. Note that these `None` branches are already exercised because the old `getRemoteBytes` returned `None` when no remote locations for the block could be found (which could occur if an executor died and its block manager de-registered with the master).\n","created_at":"2016-09-09T22:03:26Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T20:00:31Z","closed_at":"2016-09-12T22:46:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1bcb45d34bd2919e4380c4c117f3d5e2ae1765cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15037/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15037/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15037/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/283ee7912d84ec148ef0a0783028dc2de3ddb6f8","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-17485","ref":"SPARK-17485","sha":"283ee7912d84ec148ef0a0783028dc2de3ddb6f8","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

patch makes three minor refactorings to the BlockManager:\n- Move the `if (info.tellMaster)` check out of `reportBlockStatus`; this fixes an issue where a debug logging message would incorrectly claim to have reported a block status to the master even though no message had been sent (in case `info.tellMaster == false`). This also makes it easier to write code which unconditionally sends block statuses to the master (which is necessary in another patch of mine).\n- Split  `removeBlock()` into two methods, the existing method and an internal `removeBlockInternal()` method which is designed to be called by internal code that already holds a write lock on the block. This is also needed by a followup patch.\n- Instead of calling `getCurrentBlockStatus()` in `removeBlock()`, just pass `BlockStatus.empty`; the block status should always be empty following complete removal of a block.\n\nThese changes were originally authored as part of a bug fix patch which is targeted at branch-2.0 and master; I've split them out here into their own separate PR in order to make them easier to review and so that the behavior-changing parts of my other patch can be isolated to their own PR.\n","created_at":"2016-09-09T20:47:28Z","updated_at":"2016-09-15T18:51:06Z","closed_at":"2016-09-12T20:13:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0dc2cbe781ad58808bafce75cd424fc05a7793a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15036/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15036/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15036/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c3cc277af163c86cf6c238f475b8374118753198","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:cache-failure-race-conditions-refactorings-only","ref":"cache-failure-race-conditions-refactorings-only","sha":"c3cc277af163c86cf6c238f475b8374118753198","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUsing SparkSession in Spark 2.0 to read a Hive table which is stored as parquet files and if there has been a schema evolution from int to long of a column, we will get _java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.MutableLong cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.MutableInt_. To be specific, if there are some old parquet files using int for the column while some new parquet files use long and the Hive metastore uses Long as its type, the aforementioned exception will be thrown. Because Hive and Presto deem this kind of schema evolution is valid, this PR allows writing a int value when its table schema is long in hive metastore.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nScala's List.length method is O(N) and it makes the gatherCompressibilityStats function O(N^2). Eliminate the List.length calls by writing it in Scala way.\n\nhttps://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.10.x/src/library/scala/collection/LinearSeqOptimized.scala#L36\n\nAs suggested. Extended the fix to HiveInspectors and AggregationIterator classes as well.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nProfiled a Spark job and found that CompressibleColumnBuilder is using 39% of the CPU. Out of this 39% CompressibleColumnBuilder->gatherCompressibilityStats is using 23% of it. 6.24% of the CPU is spend on List.length which is called inside gatherCompressibilityStats.\n\nAfter this change we started to save 6.24% of the CPU.\n","created_at":"2016-09-09T19:34:43Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T19:46:00Z","closed_at":"2016-09-14T08:55:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8dd334bfd63cc6cc797f31732a251ad22a5d052","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/75e0d8d0e26e962d61e214c79ac1e33d372911c6","head":{"label":"seyfe:gatherCompressibilityStats","ref":"gatherCompressibilityStats","sha":"75e0d8d0e26e962d61e214c79ac1e33d372911c6","user":{"login":"seyfe","id":4723352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjMzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4723352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe","html_url":"https://github.com/seyfe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56088870,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjA4ODg3MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"seyfe/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"seyfe","id":4723352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjMzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4723352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe","html_url":"https://github.com/seyfe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seyfe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/seyfe/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen there is any Python UDF in the Project between Sort and Limit, it will be collected into TakeOrderedAndProjectExec, ExtractPythonUDFs failed to pull the Python UDFs out because QueryPlan.expressions does not include the expression inside Option[Seq[Expression]].\n\nIdeally, we should fix the `QueryPlan.expressions`, but tried with no luck (it always run into infinite loop). In PR, I changed the TakeOrderedAndProjectExec to no use Option[Seq[Expression]] to workaround it. cc @JoshRosen \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDuring startup of Spark standalone, the script file spark-config.sh appends to the PYTHONPATH and can be sourced many times, causing duplicates in the path.  This change adds a env flag that is set when the PYTHONPATH is appended so it will happen only one time.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually started standalone master/worker and verified PYTHONPATH has no duplicate

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen the metadata logs for various parts of Structured Streaming are stored on non-HDFS filesystems such as NFS or ext4, the HDFSMetadataLog class leaves hidden HDFS-style checksum (CRC) files in the log directory, one file per batch. This PR modifies HDFSMetadataLog so that it detects the use of a filesystem that doesn't use CRC files and removes the CRC files.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nModified an existing test case in HDFSMetadataLogSuite to check whether HDFSMetadataLog correctly removes CRC files on the local POSIX filesystem.  Ran the entire regression suite.\n","created_at":"2016-09-09T17:35:36Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T08:41:11Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T06:02:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85f95657828e0861ed65a20ebbfd82a142737b9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ff89c0228c09764fa6444528050a35e823db0e6","head":{"label":"frreiss:fred-17475","ref":"fred-17475","sha":"9ff89c0228c09764fa6444528050a35e823db0e6","user":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61155195,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTE1NTE5NQ==","name":"spark-fred","full_name":"frreiss/spark-fred","private":false,"owner":{"login":"frreiss","id":12436991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2OTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12436991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss","html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/frreiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/frreiss/spark-fred","description":"Mirror
