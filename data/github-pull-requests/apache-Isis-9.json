Test1\r\n```org.apache.causeway.applib.layout.menubars.bootstrap.BSMenuBars_roundtrip_Test#happyCase```\r\n## Cause of error\r\nThis test was found flaky by an open-source research tool [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex), which will shuffle implementation-dependent operations. The error was thrown by: ```assertThat(xml, is(equalTo(xml2)));```. The flakiness was resulted from the indeterminant order of the bodies inside the XML strings. The storage of properties inside of BSMenuBars implemented ConcurrentHashMap. It is impossible to maintain the concurrency while keeping a fixed order of the elements. The resulting xml and xml2 strings from NonDex shuffling will therefore not match.

The NonDex shuffling randomized the interferences of ```getLastName()```, ```SetLastName()```, ```getFirstName()```, ```SetFirstName()``` inside of ```CustomerWithInterferingProperties``` object. The test case only covers the \"firstName\" case. When the NonDex shuffling resulted in the interference of ```setlastName()``` and ```getFirstName```, the thrown exception should contain \"lastName\" but not \"firstName\". The error messages: \r\n```\r\n[ERROR]   PojoTester_broken_Test.strict_when_interference_between_properties:50 \r\nExpecting throwable message:\r\n  \"lastName: setLastName interferes with getFirstName\"\r\nto contain:\r\n  \"firstName\"\r\nbut did not.\r\n```\r\n## Changes proposed \r\nThe fix was rather simple.

These methods update the original DOM, as well as the Elements list.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2017\">jhy/jsoup#2017</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the NodeIterator class, to efficiently traverse a node tree using the Iterator interface. And\nadded Stream Element#stream() and Node#nodeStream() methods, to enable fluent composable stream pipelines of node\ntraversals.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2051\">jhy/jsoup#2051</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when changing the OutputSettings syntax to XML, the xhtml EscapeMode is automatically set by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the <code>:is(selector list)</code> pseudo-selector, which finds elements that match any of the selectors in\nthe selector list. Useful for making large ORed selectors more readable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: repackaged the library with native (vs automatic) JPMS module support.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2025\">jhy/jsoup#2025</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: better fidelity of source positions when tracking is enabled. And implicitly created or closed elements\nare tracked and detectable via Range.isImplicit().\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2056\">jhy/jsoup#2056</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when source tracking is enabled, the source position for attribute names and values is now available.\nAttribute#sourceRange() provides the ranges.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2057\">jhy/jsoup#2057</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when running concurrently under Java 21+ Virtual Threads, virtual threads could be pinned to their\ncarrier platform thread when parsing an input stream. To improve performance, particularly when parsing fetched\nURLs, the internal ConstrainableInputStream has been replaced by ControllableInputStream, which avoids the locking\nwhich caused that pinning.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2054\">jhy/jsoup#2054</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Jsoup.Connect, allow any XML mimetype as a supported mimetype. Was previously limited to\n<code>{application|text}/xml</code>. This enables for e.g. fetching SVGs with a image/svg+xml mimetype, without having to\ndisable mimetype validation.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2059\">jhy/jsoup#2059</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when outputting with XML syntax, HTML elements that were parsed as data nodes (<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) should\nbe emitted as CDATA nodes, so that they can be parsed correctly by an XML parser.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1720\">jhy/jsoup#1720</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the Immediate Parent selector <code>&gt;</code> could match elements above the root context element, causing incorrect\nelements to be returned when used on elements other than the root document.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

These methods update the original DOM, as well as the Elements list.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2017\">jhy/jsoup#2017</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the NodeIterator class, to efficiently traverse a node tree using the Iterator interface. And\nadded Stream Element#stream() and Node#nodeStream() methods, to enable fluent composable stream pipelines of node\ntraversals.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2051\">jhy/jsoup#2051</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when changing the OutputSettings syntax to XML, the xhtml EscapeMode is automatically set by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the <code>:is(selector list)</code> pseudo-selector, which finds elements that match any of the selectors in\nthe selector list. Useful for making large ORed selectors more readable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: repackaged the library with native (vs automatic) JPMS module support.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2025\">jhy/jsoup#2025</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: better fidelity of source positions when tracking is enabled. And implicitly created or closed elements\nare tracked and detectable via Range.isImplicit().\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2056\">jhy/jsoup#2056</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when source tracking is enabled, the source position for attribute names and values is now available.\nAttribute#sourceRange() provides the ranges.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2057\">jhy/jsoup#2057</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when running concurrently under Java 21+ Virtual Threads, virtual threads could be pinned to their\ncarrier platform thread when parsing an input stream. To improve performance, particularly when parsing fetched\nURLs, the internal ConstrainableInputStream has been replaced by ControllableInputStream, which avoids the locking\nwhich caused that pinning.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2054\">jhy/jsoup#2054</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Jsoup.Connect, allow any XML mimetype as a supported mimetype. Was previously limited to\n<code>{application|text}/xml</code>. This enables for e.g. fetching SVGs with a image/svg+xml mimetype, without having to\ndisable mimetype validation.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2059\">jhy/jsoup#2059</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when outputting with XML syntax, HTML elements that were parsed as data nodes (<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) should\nbe emitted as CDATA nodes, so that they can be parsed correctly by an XML parser.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1720\">jhy/jsoup#1720</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the Immediate Parent selector <code>&gt;</code> could match elements above the root context element, causing incorrect\nelements to be returned when used on elements other than the root document.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Evaluators\nare sorted by their relative execution cost, and executed in order of lower to higher cost. This speeds the\nmatching process by ensuring that simpler evaluations (such as a tag name match) are conducted prior to more\ncomplex evaluations (such as an attribute regex, or a deep child scan with a :has).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added support for <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags (and their children). This includes tag namespaces and case\npreservation on applicable tags and attributes.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2008\">jhy/jsoup#2008</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, HTML documents will be placed in the\n<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace by default, per the HTML5 spec. This can be controlled by setting\n<code>W3CDom#namespaceAware(false)</code>.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1848\">jhy/jsoup#1848</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: speed optimized the Structural Evaluators by memoizing previous evaluations. Particularly the <code>~</code>\n(any preceding sibling) and <code>:nth-of-type</code> selectors are improved.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1956\">jhy/jsoup#1956</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: tweaked the performance of the Element nextElementSibling, previousElementSibling, firstElementSibling,\nlastElementSibling, firstElementChild, and lastElementChild. They now inplace filter/skip in the child-node list, vs\nhaving to allocate and scan a complete Element filtered list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: optimized internal methods that previously called Element.children() to use filter/skip child-node list\naccessors instead, reducing new Element List allocations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: tweaked the performance of parsing :pseudo selectors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when using the <code>:empty</code> pseudo-selector, blank textnodes are now considered empty. Previously,\nan element containing any whitespace was not considered empty.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1976\">jhy/jsoup#1976</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in forms, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> should be excluded from formData() (and hence from form submissions).\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2010\">jhy/jsoup#2010</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Safelist, made isSafeTag and isSafeAttribute public methods, for extensibility.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1780\">jhy/jsoup#1780</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: <code>form</code> elements and empty elements (such as <code>img</code>) did not have their attributes de-duplicated.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1950\">jhy/jsoup#1950</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: if Document.OutputSettings was cloned from a clone, an NPE would be thrown when used.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1964\">jhy/jsoup#1964</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in Jsoup.connect(url), URL paths containing a %2B were incorrectly recoded to a '+', or a '+' was recoded\nto a ' '. Fixed by reverting to the previous behavior of not encoding supplied paths, other than normalizing to\nASCII.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1952\">jhy/jsoup#1952</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
