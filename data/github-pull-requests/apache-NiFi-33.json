The orders of elements in the HashMaps and HashSet are not the same every time being called. In this case, LinkedHashMap and LinkedHashSet is applied to replace Hash in order to ensure the orders are not changing. \r\n\r\n- `org.apache.nifi.reporting.prometheus.TestPrometheusRecordSink.testSendData`\r\n- `org.apache.nifi.reporting.azure.loganalytics.TestAzureLogAnalyticsProvenanceReportingTask.testAddField2`\r\n- `org.apache.nifi.distributed.cache.server.map.DistributedMapCacheTest.testSubMap`\r\n\r\nIt matters to fix this flaky test as it may cause potential issues due to the uncertainty of orders from HashMaps and HashSet rather than the program itself.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x]

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10586](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10586) Prioritizes the `ssh-rsa` Key Algorithm in SFTP Processors when the `Key Algorithms Allowed` property is not configured.\r\n\r\nThis approach provides the widest degree of compatibility in the default configuration, following changes in SSHJ 0.33.0. The default SSHJ configuration supports `ssh-rsa` as well as `rsa-sha2-256` and `rsa-sha2-512`, but this change prioritizes the legacy algorithm for better compatibility. SSHJ 0.33.0 also supports trying all configured RSA algorithms, which allows SSHJ to communicate with servers that have disabled the `ssh-rsa` algorithm.\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Description\nThis PR adds minimum token permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN in GitHub Actions workflows using [secure-workflows](https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows).\n\nThe GitHub Actions workflow has a GITHUB_TOKEN with write access to multiple scopes. Here is an example of the permissions in one of the workflow runs:\nhttps://github.com/apache/nifi/actions/runs/3167551611/jobs/5158128990#step:1:19\n\nAfter this change, the scopes will be reduced to the minimum needed for the following workflows:\n\n- ci-workflow.yml\n- stale.yml\n- system-tests.yml\n\n\n### Motivation and Context\n\n- This is a security best practice, so if the GITHUB_TOKEN is compromised due to a vulnerability or compromised Action, the damage will be reduced.\n- [GitHub recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token) defining minimum GITHUB_TOKEN permissions.\n- The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) [Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) also treats not setting token permissions as a high-risk issue. This change will help increase the Scorecard score for this repository.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ashish Kurmi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10569](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10569) Adds a new `Maximum Threads` property to the `HandleHttpRequest` Processor, enabling configuration of the internal Jetty server thread pool.\r\n\r\nThe new property follows the pattern of the property added for `ListenHTTP` in [NIFI-8263](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-8263). The default value is `200`, which aligns with the current internal default that Jetty uses in absence of a specific number. The Jetty Thread Pool sets a minimum of 8 threads, so the allowable range for the value is between 8 and 1000, matching `ListenHTTP`. The introduction of a configured Thread Pool also provides the opportunity to name threads using the Processor name and Processor identifier.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include a simple unit test class to set minimum required properties and start the Processor without handling any requests. The integration test method `testCleanup` does not appear to run in reliable way, and more recent integration test methods verify similar capabilities, so changes include removing the `testCleanup` method.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10563](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10563) Adds a direct dependency on `commons-lang3` to `nifi-bootstrap` based on direct references to `StringUtils` in several classes. Additional changes include updating the Ranger assembly configuration to include `commons-lang3` in the installation libraries directory.\r\n\r\nThese changes are necessary to avoid runtime class path

PR adds explicit [permissions section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) to workflows. This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.\r\nIt is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and grant write permissions on [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) case by

PR contains UI changes around Add/Edit Registry dialogs as a result of changes in https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/6433.\r\n\r\nA quick summary of the work in this PR: \r\n* Previously, we utilized one dialog for both adding and editing a registry. Because we need to support adding/editing/deleting properties, the two dialogs have much less in common now. I've separated the dialogs into two distinct .jsp files.\r\n* I removed the url input in the Add Registry dialog and added a combo dropdown for class type selection.\r\n* ~I added tabs to the Edit Registry dialog. One of these tabs contains a table for adding/editing properties. I'm currently waiting to see if #6433 will support dynamic properties. If it doesn't, I'll need to update this work to conditionally show/hide the add property button. It currently does not work in this PR.~ This PR now supports dynamic properties\r\n* ~This PR contains all the changes from #6433. I'm unable to start NiFi with latest work on that branch due to some java errors, which @simonbence is aware of. I'm going to open this PR as a draft until that's resolved.~ This is now resolved.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10538](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10538)\r\n\r\n#

NiFi is capable to connect only to the NiFi Registry as a \"registry repository\". It would be beneficial to give NiFi the capability to depend on other services.\r\n\r\nIn order to this, I suggest to decouple the registry behaviour from the NiFi Registry as much as it is possible (inlcuding but not only the API and the Resources) and move the actual implementation behind this new API.\r\n\r\nTo be able to add new implementations, this new API must be an extension point applying the usual NiFi instruments for this. Also it is paramunt to keep the continuity with the current usages and make the implementation capable to process the current REST call format.\r\n\r\nThis is a draft PR for early review, but please expect a PR soonish.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10505) Removes the unused `org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient` dependency from `nifi-web-api` to avoid Linkage Errors that can occur when enabling Sensitive Property Provider implementations that depend on Apache HttpClient.\r\n\r\nThe ClassLoader hierarchy results in Linkage Errors for the HashiCorp Vault and GCP KMS Sensitive Property Provider due to a runtime conflict between loaded copies of HttpClient classes. The HttpClient library is already included in `nifi-framework-nar`, which does not result in runtime conflicts, which also makes the duplicate copy of the library unnecessary in `nifi-web-api`.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi
