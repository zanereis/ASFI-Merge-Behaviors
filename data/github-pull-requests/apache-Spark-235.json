What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOn the worker we express lambda functions as strings and then eval them to create a \"mapper\" function. This make the code hard to read & limits the # of arguments a udf can support to 256 for python <= 3.6.\r\n\r\nThis PR rewrites the mapper functions as nested functions instead of \"lambda strings\" and allows passing in more than 255 args.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe jira ticket associated with this issue describes how MLflow uses udfs to consume columns as features. This pattern isn't unique and a limit of 255 features is quite low.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nUsers can now pass more than 255 cols to a udf function.\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR addresses issues where conflicting attributes in `Expand` are not correctly handled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n```Scala\r\nval numsDF = Seq(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).toDF(\"nums\")\r\nval cubeDF = numsDF.cube(\"nums\").agg(max(lit(0)).as(\"agcol\"))\r\ncubeDF.join(cubeDF, \"nums\").show\r\n```\r\nfails with the following exception:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException:\r\nFailure when resolving conflicting references in Join:\r\n'Join Inner\r\n:- Aggregate [nums#38, spark_grouping_id#36], [nums#38, max(0) AS agcol#35]\r\n:  +- Expand [List(nums#3, nums#37, 0), List(nums#3, null, 1)], [nums#3, nums#38, spark_grouping_id#36]\r\n:     +- Project [nums#3, nums#3 AS nums#37]\r\n:        +- Project [value#1 AS nums#3]\r\n:           +- LocalRelation [value#1]\r\n+- Aggregate [nums#38, spark_grouping_id#36], [nums#38, max(0) AS agcol#58]\r\n   +- Expand [List(nums#3, nums#37, 0), List(nums#3, null, 1)], [nums#3, nums#38, spark_grouping_id#36]\r\n                                                                         ^^^^^^^\r\n      +- Project [nums#3, nums#3 AS nums#37]\r\n         +- Project [value#1 AS nums#3]\r\n            +- LocalRelation [value#1]\r\n\r\nConflicting attributes: nums#38\r\n```\r\nAs you can see from the above plan, `num#38`, the output of `Expand` on the right side of `Join`, should have been handled to produce new attribute. Since the conflict is not resolved in `Expand`, the failure is happening upstream at `Aggregate`. This PR addresses handling conflicting attributes in `Expand`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the previous example now shows the following output:\r\n```\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n|nums|agcol|agcol|\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n|   1|    0|    0|\r\n|   6|    0|    0|\r\n|   4|    0|    0|\r\n|   2|    0|    0|\r\n|   5|    0|    0|\r\n|   3|    0|    0|\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

PR is based on an existing/previou PR - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19045\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis changes adds a decommissioning state that we can enter when the cloud provider/scheduler lets us know we aren't going to be removed immediately but instead will be removed soon. This concept fits nicely in K8s and also with spot-instances on AWS / preemptible instances all of which we can get a notice that our host is going away. For now we simply stop scheduling jobs, in the future we could perform some kind of migration of data during scale-down, or at least stop accepting new blocks to cache.\r\n\r\nThere is a design document at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xVO1b6KAwdUhjEJBolVPl9C6sLj7oOveErwDSYdT-pE/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWith more move to preemptible multi-tenancy, serverless environments, and spot-instances better handling of node scale down is required.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThere is no API change, however an additional configuration flag is added to enable/disable this behaviour.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew integration tests in the Spark K8s integration testing. Extension of the AppClientSuite to test decommissioning seperate from the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- `SqlBase.g4` is modified to support a negative sign `-` in the interval type constructor from a string and in interval literals\r\n- Negate interval in `AstBuilder` if a sign presents.\r\n- Interval related SQL statements are moved from `inputs/datetime.sql` to new file `inputs/interval.sql` \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select -interval '-1 month 1 day -1 second';\r\n1 months -1 days 1 seconds\r\nspark-sql> select -interval -1 month 1 day -1 second;\r\n1 months -1 days 1 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor feature parity with PostgreSQL which supports that:\r\n```sql\r\n# select -interval '-1 month 1 day -1 second';\r\n        ?column?\r\n-------------------------\r\n 1 mon -1 days +00:00:01\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests to `ExpressionParserSuite`\r\n- by `interval.sql`\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-08T10:53:24Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:41:05Z","closed_at":"2019-11-10T18:10:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4da37a776543a474fda6ed6506482a454c76ea9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ab33d2ac5f8625ff0258e678b1ff28d37188d18b","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:negative-interval","ref":"negative-interval","sha":"ab33d2ac5f8625ff0258e678b1ff28d37188d18b","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n \r\nCurrent catalyst rewrite non-correlated exists subquery to BroadcastNestLoopJoin, it's performance is not good , now we rewrite non-correlated EXISTS subquery to ScalaSubquery to optimize the performance. \r\nWe rewrite \r\n```\r\n WHERE EXISTS (SELECT A FROM TABLE B WHERE COL1 > 10)\r\n```\r\nto \r\n```\r\n WHERE (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT A FROM TABLE B WHERE COL1 > 10) LIMIT 1) IS NOT NULL\r\n```\r\nto avoid build join to solve EXISTS expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOptimize EXISTS performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManuel

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExecutorPodsAllocator does not limit the number of executor errors or deletions, which may cause executor restart continuously without application failure.\r\nA simple example for this, add `--conf spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-Xmse` after spark-submit, which can make executor restart thousands of times without application failure.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRun suites and add suite

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to infer bytes as binary types in Python 3. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25749 for discussions. I have also checked that Arrow considers `bytes` as binary type, and PySpark UDF can also accepts `bytes` as a binary type.\r\n\r\nSince `bytes` is not a `str` anymore in Python 3, it's clear to call it `BinaryType` in Python 3.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo respect Python 3's `bytes` type and support Python's primitive types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([[b\"abc\"]])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/types.py\", line

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExplicitly clear registered metrics when `MetricsSystem` shuts down.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29795 for a complete explanation. The TL;DR is there is some evidence this could leak resources after Spark is shut down, and that may be a minor issue in Spark 3+ for apps or tests that re-start SparkContexts in the same JVM.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe possible difference here is that, after Spark is stopped, metrics are no longer available. It's unclear to me whether this is intended behavior anyway.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29795 for more context:\r\n- Spark 3 already passes tests without this change\r\n- Spark 2.4 does too, as exists in branch-2.4 now\r\n- Spark 2.4 fails tests if metrics 4.x is used, without this change\r\n\r\nThe last point is not directly relevant, as Spark 2.4 will not use metrics 4.x. It's evidence that it addresses some potential issue, however.","created_at":"2019-11-07T17:26:40Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T00:31:03Z","closed_at":"2019-11-09T14:47:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e92fff68f2e3dea1af0930a636ba57941a83e35c","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/08fcf06cdade7e8f07503242eee05e02149fcd35","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-29795","ref":"SPARK-29795","sha":"08fcf06cdade7e8f07503242eee05e02149fcd35","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

For example, the query plan already contains the parsed partition/bucket column names, and it's tricky if we need to quote the names before creating v2 expressions.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change the interval scala APIs to take `NamedReference` directly, with a new method to create `NamedReference` with the exact name parts.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen we drop a partition which exist on Hive meta and doesn't exist on HDFS, it should be dropped successfully instead of throwing MetaException.\r\n\r\nHive also deals with this case by this method.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nBefore this patch:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql > alter table test.tmp drop partition(stat_day=20190516);\r\nError: Error running query: MetaException(message:File does not exist: /user/hive/warehouse/test.db/tmp/stat_day=20190516\r\n\tat

partition which exist on Hive meta and doesn't exist on HDFS, we will receive MetaException. But actually, this partition has been dropped. It's quite confusing and in this case, no Exception should be thrown.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-07T07:43:52Z","updated_at":"2020-05-29T08:41:08Z","closed_at":"2020-05-29T08:39:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"796d86f8dec62cd377dc9eaad333d93bcbf9f287","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8b96de283f692781568903f0c27b1532808ecc4","head":{"label":"Deegue:fix_empty_partition_InvalidInputException","ref":"fix_empty_partition_InvalidInputException","sha":"f8b96de283f692781568903f0c27b1532808ecc4","user":{"login":"Deegue","id":25916266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTE2MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25916266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue","html_url":"https://github.com/Deegue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194640910,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ2NDA5MTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"Deegue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Deegue","id":25916266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTE2MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25916266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue","html_url":"https://github.com/Deegue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Deegue/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd configuration `spark.sql.thriftServer.ignoreDefaultDatabase` to control whether it will request a free executor when we opening a new session of Spark Thrift Server.\r\n\r\n`use:database` is supported in [SPARK-17819](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17819).\r\n\r\nIf we set `spark.sql.thriftServer.ignoreDefaultDatabase=true`, we don't need to allocate an executor and opening a session to Spark Thrift Server costs only ~100ms.\r\n\r\nIf we set `spark.sql.thriftServer.ignoreDefaultDatabase=false`, opening a session to Spark Thrift Server cost at least ~5s or up to the time util we get a free executor.\r\n\r\nThe default of `spark.sql.thriftServer.ignoreDefaultDatabase` is false.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's not reasonable that a free executor is needed when we open a session. Especially when all  the executors are busy and our cluster is under big pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nIf you don't need opening a session to Spark Thrift Server with configurations, it's better to set `spark.sql.thriftServer.ignoreDefaultDatabase=true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-07T06:49:52Z","updated_at":"2020-02-19T00:11:49Z","closed_at":"2020-02-19T00:11:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c14e0445541fba7a779835d918ad8759ed8e3b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26421/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26421/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26421/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f939b7cd03e2a30601a818aab4536e5ee2d95f87","head":{"label":"Deegue:optimize_open_session_in_thriftserver","ref":"optimize_open_session_in_thriftserver","sha":"f939b7cd03e2a30601a818aab4536e5ee2d95f87","user":{"login":"Deegue","id":25916266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTE2MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25916266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue","html_url":"https://github.com/Deegue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194640910,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ2NDA5MTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"Deegue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Deegue","id":25916266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTE2MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25916266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue","html_url":"https://github.com/Deegue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deegue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Deegue/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to compact old event log files when end users enable rolling event log, and clean up these files after compaction.\r\n\r\nHere the \"compaction\" really mean is filtering out listener events for finished/removed things - like jobs and SQL executions which take most of space for event log file. To achieve this, compactor does two phases reading: 1) tracking the live jobs and SQL executions (and more to add) 2) filtering events via leveraging the information about live things and rewriting to the \"compacted\" file.\r\n\r\nThis approach retains the ability of compatibility on event log file and adds the possibility of reducing the overall size of event logs. There's a downside here as well: executor metrics for tasks would be inaccurate, as compactor will filter out the task events which job is finished, but I don't feel it as a blocker.\r\n\r\nThe compaction is triggered whenever FsHistoryProvider considers the app log as reload target: we only run compaction if there's new event log file be available via memorizing the last index to try compaction, so the compaction is actually triggered per new addition of event log file.\r\n\r\nAlso, first phase of two phases is done incrementally (in other words, event filter builder is constructed and updated incrementally, per log file); so even compaction is triggered with new log files, only new log files will be read for updating event filter builder. Second phase still requires reading all of event log files per compacting, though.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOne of major goal of SPARK-28594 is to prevent the event logs to become too huge, and SPARK-29779 achieves the goal. We've got another approach in prior, but the old approach required models in both KVStore and live entities to guarantee compatibility, while they're not designed to do so.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs. Also manually tested with my event log

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd an analyzer rule to convert unresolved `Add`, `Subtract`, etc. to `TimeAdd`, `DateAdd`, etc. according to the following policy:\r\n```scala\r\n /**\r\n   * For [[Add]]:\r\n   * 1. if both side are interval, stays the same;\r\n   * 2. else if one side is interval, turns it to [[TimeAdd]];\r\n   * 3. else if one side is date, turns it to [[DateAdd]] ;\r\n   * 4. else stays the same.\r\n   *\r\n   * For [[Subtract]]:\r\n   * 1. if both side are interval, stays the same;\r\n   * 2. else if the right side is an interval, turns it to [[TimeSub]];\r\n   * 3. else if one side is timestamp, turns it to [[SubtractTimestamps]];\r\n   * 4. else if the right side is date, turns it to [[DateDiff]]/[[SubtractDates]];\r\n   * 5. else if the left side is date, turns it to [[DateSub]];\r\n   * 6. else turns it to stays the same.\r\n   *\r\n   * For [[Multiply]]:\r\n   * 1. If one side is interval, turns it to [[MultiplyInterval]];\r\n   * 2. otherwise, stays the same.\r\n   *\r\n   * For [[Divide]]:\r\n   * 1. If the left side is interval, turns it to [[DivideInterval]];\r\n   * 2. otherwise, stays the same.\r\n   */\r\n```\r\nBesides, we change datetime functions from implicit cast types to strict ones, all available type coercions happen in `DateTimeOperations` coercion rule.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFeature Parity between PostgreSQL and Spark, and make the null semantic consistent with Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n1. date_add/date_sub functions only accept int/tinynit/smallint as the second arg, double/string etc, are forbidden like hive, which produce weird results.\r\n2. datetime arithmetic operations become `NullIntolerant`, e.g. `select timestamp'1999-12-31 00:00:00' - null ` is valid now\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid frequently changing the value of `spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.maxNumPostShufflePartitions`, we usually set `spark.sql.adaptive.shuffle.maxNumPostShufflePartitions` much larger than `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` after enabling adaptive execution, which causes some bucket map join lose efficacy and add more `ShuffleExchange`.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n```scala\r\nval bucketedTableName = \"bucketed_table\"\r\nspark.range(10000).write.bucketBy(500, \"id\").sortBy(\"id\").mode(org.apache.spark.sql.SaveMode.Overwrite).saveAsTable(bucketedTableName)\r\nval bucketedTable = spark.table(bucketedTableName)\r\nval df = spark.range(8)\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold\", -1)\r\n// Spark 2.4. spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=false\r\n// We set spark.sql.shuffle.partitions <= 500 every time based

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUsers can set the `spark.app.id` when `spark-submit`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPlease see referenced JIRA.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNo test, as the `spark.app.id` would be set by users only when they set it, if not, the `spark.app.id` would be generated by the original mechanism.","created_at":"2019-11-06T06:43:51Z","updated_at":"2019-11-10T21:11:26Z","closed_at":"2019-11-10T21:11:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6ef64b3af643e4aef85b1fe14b6a446a54bc068","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26407/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26407/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26407/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/49bd79c94ed6f1c7252572e892e149bd9260d666","head":{"label":"runzhliu:appid","ref":"appid","sha":"49bd79c94ed6f1c7252572e892e149bd9260d666","user":{"login":"runzhliu","id":20874664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODc0NjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20874664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/runzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/runzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6233958ab60ef7f1e7d6e3932a013e6e6afa167e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds `@JsonDeserialize` annotation for the field which type is `Option[Long]` in LogInfo/AttemptInfoWrapper. It hits https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala/wiki/FAQ#deserializing-optionint-and-other-primitive-challenges - other existing json models take care of this, but we missed to add annotation to these classes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this change, SHS will throw ClassNotFoundException when rebuilding App UI.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.","created_at":"2019-11-05T09:28:52Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T02:44:28Z","closed_at":"2019-11-11T23:49:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"095d08a5ef2011176a7b60d9e9493add9e23114e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, change the scope of `ml.SummarizerBuffer` and add a method `createSummarizerBuffer` for it, so it can be used as an aggregator like `MultivariateOnlineSummarizer`;\r\n2, In LoR/AFT/LiR/SVC, use Summarizer instead of MultivariateOnlineSummarizer\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe computation of summary before learning iterations is a bottleneck in high-dimension cases, since `MultivariateOnlineSummarizer` compute much more than needed.\r\nIn the [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29754) is an example, with `--driver-memory=4G` LoR will always fail on KDDA dataset. If we swith to `ml.Summarizer`, then `--driver-memory=3G` is enough to train a model.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nuse `ml.Summarizer` instead of `mllib.MultivariateOnlineSummarizer`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, I found that using `ml.Summarizer` is faster than current impl;\r\n2, `mllib.MultivariateOnlineSummarizer` maintain all arrays, while `ml.Summarizer` only maintain necessary arrays\r\n3, using `ml.Summarizer` will avoid vector conversions to `mlllib.Vector`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to replace `cc` with `java` in `test_pipe_functions` of `test_rdd.py`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `test_rdd.py` assumes `cc` installation during `rdd.pipe` tests.\r\nThis requires us to install `gcc` for python testing. If we use `java`, we can have the same test coverage and we don't need to install it because it's already installed in `PySpark` test environment.\r\n\r\nThis will be helpful when we build a dockerized parallel testing environment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the existing PySpark tests.","created_at":"2019-11-04T05:58:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T03:33:23Z","closed_at":"2019-11-04T07:03:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7ebe4389cbd85219e9e09136b67a228d1f26c75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b4a86cf2248bdf86ca1193cc89cccacdeba3813","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-29739","ref":"SPARK-29739","sha":"8b4a86cf2248bdf86ca1193cc89cccacdeba3813","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5ba17d09acf67e0bcd66a770f6b4e1abe7d52ecf","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Retry the tests for special date-time values on failure. The tests can potentially fail when reference values were taken before midnight and test code resolves special values after midnight. The retry can guarantees that the tests run during the same day.\r\n- Simplify getting of the current timestamp via `Instant.now()`. This should avoid any issues of converting current local datetime to an instance. For example, the same local time can be mapped to 2 instants when clocks are turned backward 1 hour on daylight saving date.\r\n- Extract common code to SQLHelper\r\n- Set the tested zoneId to the session time zone in `DateTimeUtilsSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make the tests more stable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites `Date`/`TimestampFormatterSuite` and `DateTimeUtilsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-03T19:15:24Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:40:57Z","closed_at":"2019-11-04T08:59:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"78cf20be2124177eb1a72304a82972b87db601dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26380/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26380/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26380/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/44aeda8aeb298f721a5732c77f96ce4530508d74","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:retry-on-fail","ref":"retry-on-fail","sha":"44aeda8aeb298f721a5732c77f96ce4530508d74","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

Currently from Historyserver we can't access the JDBC/ODBC tab for thrift server applications. In this PR, I am doing 2 main changes\r\n1. Refactor existing thrift server listener to support kvstore\r\n2. Add history server plugin for thrift server listener and tab.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsers can access Thriftserver tab from History server for both running and finished applications,\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nSupport for JDBC/ODBC tab  for the WEBUI from History server\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd UT and Manual tests\r\n1. Start Thriftserver and Historyserver\r\n```\r\nsbin/stop-thriftserver.sh\r\nsbin/stop-historyserver.sh\r\nsbin/start-thriftserver.sh\r\nsbin/start-historyserver.sh\r\n```\r\n2. Launch beeline\r\n`bin/beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000`\r\n\r\n3. Run queries\r\n\r\nGo to the JDBC/ODBC page of the WebUI from History server\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23054875/68365501-cf013700-0156-11ea-84b4-fda8008c92c4.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-03T09:44:02Z","updated_at":"2019-11-30T05:50:43Z","closed_at":"2019-11-30T03:44:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37e86574ebf09b7d593ec9f6118c29130127908c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd AlterTableSerDePropertiesStatement and make ALTER TABLE ... SET SERDE/SERDEPROPERTIES go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nALTER TABLE t SET SERDE 'org.apache.class' // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd AlterTableAddPartitionStatement and make ALTER TABLE ... ADD PARTITION go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION (id=1) // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. When running ALTER TABLE ... ADD PARTITION, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI propose 2 new methods for `CalendarInterval`:\r\n- `extractAsPeriod()` returns the date part of an interval as an instance of `java.time.Period`\r\n- `extractAsDuration()` returns the time part of an interval as an instance of `java.time.Duration`\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> import org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.CalendarInterval\r\nscala> import java.time._\r\nscala> val i = spark.sql(\"select interval 1 year 3 months 4 days 10 hours 30 seconds\").collect()(0).getAs[CalendarInterval](0)\r\nscala> LocalDate.of(2019, 11, 1).plus(i.period())\r\nres8: java.time.LocalDate = 2021-02-05\r\nscala> ZonedDateTime.parse(\"2019-11-01T12:13:14Z\").plus(i.extractAsPeriod()).plus(i.extractAsDuration())\r\nres9: java.time.ZonedDateTime = 2021-02-05T22:13:44Z\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTaking into account that `CalendarInterval` has been already partially exposed to users via the collect operation, and probably it will be fully exposed in the future, it could be convenient for users to get the date and time parts of intervals as java classes:\r\n- to avoid unnecessary dependency from Spark's classes in user code\r\n- to easily use external libraries that accept standard Java classes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy new test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDisallow creating a permanent view that references a temporary view in **expressions**.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCreating a permanent view that references a temporary view is currently disallowed. For example,\r\n```SQL\r\n# The following throws org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException\r\n# Not allowed to create a permanent view `per_view` by referencing a temporary view `tmp`;\r\nCREATE VIEW per_view AS SELECT t1.a, t2.b FROM base_table t1, (SELECT * FROM tmp) t2\"\r\n```\r\nHowever, the following is allowed.\r\n```SQL\r\n\r\nCREATE VIEW per_view AS SELECT * FROM base_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM tmp);\r\n```\r\nThis PR fixes the bug where temporary views used inside expressions are not checked.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Now the following SQL query throws an exception as expected:\r\n```SQL\r\n# The following throws org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException\r\n# Not allowed to create a permanent view `per_view` by referencing a temporary view `tmp`;\r\nCREATE VIEW per_view AS SELECT * FROM base_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM tmp);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new unit tests.","created_at":"2019-11-01T16:33:01Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T01:06:55Z","closed_at":"2019-11-05T05:20:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63373e1640d88cd2b7dafbefd1f7c878dbda0bbb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26361/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26361/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26361/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/24f15f4972606241e8cc4494462586202405f3ce","head":{"label":"imback82:spark-29630","ref":"spark-29630","sha":"24f15f4972606241e8cc4494462586202405f3ce","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check the left bound - the `from` interval unit, and reset all unit values out of the specified range of interval units. Currently, `IntervalUtils.fromDayTimeString()` takes into account only the right bound but not the left one. \r\n\r\n**Note**: the reset is not performed if `spark.sql.dialect = PostgreSQL`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fix makes `fromDayTimeString()` consistent in bound handling.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extract parsing of the seconds interval units to the private method `parseNanos` in `CalendarInterval` and modify the code to correctly parse the fractional part of the seconds unit of intervals in the cases:\r\n- When the fractional part has less than 9 digits\r\n- The seconds unit is negative\r\n\r\nThis is a back port of the commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/3206a9987001d78cf2f48509a93d73af86f51cfe.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed to fix the issues:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select interval 10.123456 seconds;\r\ninterval 10 seconds 123 microseconds\r\n```\r\nThe correct result must be `interval 10 seconds 123 milliseconds 456 microseconds`\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select interval -10.123456789 seconds;\r\ninterval -9 seconds -876 milliseconds -544 microseconds\r\n```\r\nbut the whole interval should be negated, and the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf the resolved table is v1 table, AlterTableAlterColumnStatement fallbacks to v1 AlterTableChangeColumnCommand.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo make the catalog/table lookup logic consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, a ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN command previously fails on v1 tables. After this, it falls back to v1 AlterTableChangeColumnCommand.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, JDBC/ODBC tab in the WEBUI doesn't support hiding table. Other tabs in the web ui like, Jobs, stages, SQL etc supports hiding table (refer https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22592).\r\nIn this PR, added the support for hide table in the jdbc/odbc tab also.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark ui about the contents of the form need to have hidden and show features, when the table records very much. Because sometimes you do not care about the record of the table, you just want to see the contents of the next table, but you have to scroll the scroll bar for a long time to see the contents of the next table.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo, except support of hide table\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested\r\n ![Screenshot 2019-11-01 at 12 10

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of `Column.getItem` to call `Column.getItem` on Scala side instead of `Column.apply`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current behavior is not consistent with that of Scala.\r\n\r\nIn PySpark:\r\n```Python\r\ndf = spark.range(2)\r\nmap_col = create_map(lit(0), lit(100), lit(1), lit(200))\r\ndf.withColumn(\"mapped\", map_col.getItem(col('id'))).show()\r\n# +---+------+\r\n# | id|mapped|\r\n# +---+------+\r\n# |  0|   100|\r\n# |  1|   200|\r\n# +---+------+\r\n```\r\nIn Scala:\r\n```Scala\r\nval df = spark.range(2)\r\nval map_col = map(lit(0), lit(100), lit(1), lit(200))\r\n// The following getItem results in the following exception, which is the right behavior:\r\n// java.lang.RuntimeException: Unsupported literal type class org.apache.spark.sql.Column id\r\n//  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Literal$.apply(literals.scala:78)\r\n//  at org.apache.spark.sql.Column.getItem(Column.scala:856)\r\n//  ... 49 elided\r\ndf.withColumn(\"mapped\", map_col.getItem(col(\"id\"))).show\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. If the use wants to pass `Column` object to `getItem`, he/she now needs to use the indexing operator to achieve the previous behavior.\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ndf = spark.range(2)\r\nmap_col = create_map(lit(0), lit(100), lit(1), lit(200))\r\ndf.withColumn(\"mapped\", map_col[col('id'))].show()\r\n# +---+------+\r\n# | id|mapped|\r\n# +---+------+\r\n# |  0|   100|\r\n# |  1|   200|\r\n# +---+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd AlterTableRenamePartitionStatement and make ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO PARTITION go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nALTER TABLE t PARTITION (id=1) RENAME TO PARTITION (id=2) // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. When running ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO PARTITION, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a task fails with OOM exception, the `UnsafeInMemorySorter.array` could be `null`. In the meanwhile, the `cleanupResources()` on task completion would call `UnsafeInMemorySorter.getMemoryUsage` in turn, and that lead to another NPE thrown.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCheck if `array` is null in `UnsafeInMemorySorter.getMemoryUsage` and it should help to avoid NPE. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt was tested manually.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf task failed during reading shuffle data or because of executor loss, its shuffle read size would be shown as 0.\r\n\r\nBut this size is important for user, it can help detect data skew.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I compute this size and set it when task failed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAs described in above section.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, User can see shuffle read size even if task failed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch
