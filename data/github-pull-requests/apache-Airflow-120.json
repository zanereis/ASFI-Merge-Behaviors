#28195\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes all the common SQL operators I could find which showed the same problem as reported in #28195, that statements are generated \"too early\", before the templated variables have been applied.  I think all changes should have tests which break without the fix.  Some of these tests are quite brittle in that they mock complex nested SQL which is not ideal.  In my defence though, so do a lot of the tests in the file\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the `self.sql` variable as a templated parameter, allowing for templated `table`, `partition_clause`, `checks`

fixes #28146. [According to random people on the Internet (the best knowledge source)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1412787/), this is caused by subtle import statement discrepencies, and we should find and fix the offending import statements, but I think we can probably agree it’s not practical to review all `Session` imports in the Airflow code base.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, I tried to fix this by not attempting to pickle any SQLAlchemy objects at all. Unfortunately SQLAlchemy does not really provide a good way to extract information from a Query object (most things are private), so the most barely reasonable way to approach this is to serialize the query into a SQL string, and rebuild a different query from that string to unpickle. Unfortunately it is impossible to use `count()` against such a Query (I don’t know why, SQLAlchemy just crashes with a very unhelpful exception), so we calculate that part eagerly.","created_at":"2022-12-07T13:23:20Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T08:01:35Z","closed_at":"2022-12-15T09:20:25Z","merged_at":"2022-12-15T09:20:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"e981dfab4e0f4faf1fb932ac6993c3ecbd5318b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

we updated Breeze's config hash using pre-commit whenever setup files changed. This has proven to be brittle:\r\n\r\nWhen you locally work and add new dependencies, breeze would keep reinstalling every time you run it locally - without the README being updated. You'd have to manually run pre-commit in order to get it regenerated.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the flow slightly. Whenever you automatically re-install breeze, the README.md file of the folder from which you reinstall breeze gets updated with the new hash **just** before reinstalling. This means that after installation the new hash is already present in the package, and next time you run breeze it will match the changed hash of your dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe only thing left is to commit the changed README to the repo together with setup.py/cfg changes of yours.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Move check no cred exception from `test_s3` to `test_base_aws`\r\n\r\n2. Clear AWS environment variables to mocked values\r\n\r\n- If developer set in `files/airflow-breeze-config/variables.env` or in IDE some [AWS specific variables](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#using-environment-variables) it might affect local tests execution\r\n- By default if credentials not set then `botocore`/`boto3` tried to use credentials/configs from `default` profile from `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` as well as legacy boto configuration. For prevent this behaviour create temporary empty configurations files (on session level) and set appropriate ENV variables\r\n- Set fake AWS Credentials for prevent usage of actual credentials. In this case some tests might failed with `An error occurred (UnrecognizedClientException) when calling the FooBar operation: The security token included in the request is

As a result I cannot get XCOM of any task created using this operator.\r\n\r\nHere I've set limits as `1m` for cpu and `10m` for memory. IMHO, `sleep 1` command does not need more resources, even `10m` maybe too much.\r\n\r\nI haven't add any options to change these values (like in #26766), it seems that currently there is no way to change command executed by this container.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

fixed `GCSToGCSOperator` in case copying list of objects without wildcard\r\n- fixed and slightly refactored unit tests\r\n- fixed example DAG\r\n\r\nAforementioned changes of `GCSToGCSOperator` cover the following cases:\r\n\r\n1. Copy a list of files into the folder.\r\n```\r\ncopy_files = GCSToGCSOperator(\r\n    task_id='copy_files_without_wildcard',\r\n    source_bucket=SOURCE_BUCKET,\r\n    source_objects=['src/file_1.txt', 'src/file_2.csv'],\r\n    destination_bucket=TARGET_BUCKET,\r\n    destination_object='new_folder/'\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThe previous implementation didn't actually copy files - it was just creating an empty destination folder. The following fix solves this problem and performs actual copying of the listed files into the specified destination folder.\r\n\r\n2. Copy folder without trailing slash\r\n```\r\ncopy_files_from_folder = GCSToGCSOperator(\r\n        task_id='copy_folder_without_trailing_slash',\r\n        source_bucket=SOURCE_BUCKET,\r\n        source_objects=['test_folder'],\r\n        destination_bucket=TARGET_BUCKET,\r\n        destination_object='new_folder/'\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nFor example, we have a folder `test_folder/` and a file `test_folder/file.txt` inside of it. If we miss a trailing slash at the source folder name, then the previous implementation instead of copying the file `file.txt` were creating two files `test_folder` and `new_folderfile.txt`. It seems that there are two bugs here:\r\na) a file `new_folder` created instead of a folder `new_folder/`;\r\nb) a wrong path `new_folderfile.txt` for the copied file was generated instead of `new_folder/file.txt`.\r\nThe following fix resolves these problems.","created_at":"2022-12-05T09:21:58Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T23:41:31Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T23:41:24Z","merged_at":"2022-12-05T23:41:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"3fef46283857114aab46e72d4799c335e9e79f05","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

fixing this before using simplefilter but it doesn't work when application threaded. See here https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#temporarily-suppressing-warnings.\r\n\r\nIt was tricky to solve.  When \"actually\" reading the values we call super().get. You'd think this would not invoke airflow config parser `get` right? But because of config parser interpolation, ultimately, it invokes `get` again on airflow config parser.\r\n\r\nSo, we can manipulate an attr to signal when we are _accessing_ a deprecated key but only because we're retrieving the backcompat val (not because the user requested it).\r\n\r\nthe key realization is that, whenever we call get with deprecated_key , we are never using the section/key requested by the user (because that’s always tried first.  so, whenever we call get with deprecated key, we can suppress our FutureWarnings (since it’s not coming from user code)\r\n\r\nAdditionally we have to handle the case where `items` is called (e.g. from within as_dict) which calls `get` for every option you have in your config.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-05T07:56:08Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T23:11:35Z","closed_at":"2022-12-06T08:09:49Z","merged_at":"2022-12-06T08:09:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"27a84637b3ab9b5f7d0e93252ef93656bc6907ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

printed in CI have been making it difficult to see what is going on (they were taking far too much space after the test results and GitHub CI UI rendered those multi-line warnings slowly.\r\n\r\nAlso we did not have the right tools to capture the number and list of warnings that we should deal with.\r\n\r\nWe are usign pytest-capture-warnings plugin now that improves the situation twofold:\r\n\r\n* warning summary printed by the plugin in the output is shorter - each warning is at most one line\r\n* the warning text files are uploaded as artifacts which make them usable in any kind of approach where we want to attempt to start an effort to remove all warnings\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR rewrite almost all `tests/security/test_kerberos.py`:\r\n\r\n1. Migrate to `pytest`\r\n2. Rename `TestKerberos` to `TestKerberosIntegrity` and add `@pytest.mark.integration(\"kerberos\")` decorator\r\n3. Rename `TestKerberosUnit` to `TestKerberos`\r\n\r\nSeems like previously kerberos integrity test not run for a long period because it contain something which never pass in current airflow environment, for example if `[kerberos] include_ip` or `[kerberos] forwardable` set to  `\"\"` and test actually run than an error should be raised  because `conf.getboolean` couldn't parse empty string and convert it to boolean. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLocal breeze result\r\n```\r\n================================================== test session starts

earlier attempts to fix the links there were still many places\r\nwhere the links were pointing to wrong versions of examples.\r\n\r\nIt has been Noticed in:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/27774#issuecomment-1321166935\r\n\r\nThis change addresses it in three ways:\r\n\r\n* updated tool to fix the linx in historically released documentation\r\n  (applied already in https://github.com/apache/airflow-site/pull/706)\r\n* replaced hard-coded version with `|version|` everywhere and added\r\n  sphinx extension to convert those to actual provider versions (though\r\n  due to sphinx limitation it has to be done with post-processing of the\r\n  generated .html rather than replacing during generation)\r\n* added pre-commit that detects any use of example_dags links to\r\n  main/master/hard-coded version.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

`KubernetesExecutor`'s `multi_namespace_mode` requires the Scheduler to have cluster-scope role on the Kubernetes Cluster, because it's using function `list_pod_for_all_namespaces()`.\r\n\r\nHowever, in certain enterprise environments, it's not possible for users to have cluster-scope role. For example, they may only get permissions in a namespace, rather on the whole cluster. Always allowing the Scheduler pod to have cluster-scope role is not a good from security aspect either.\r\n\r\nThis change aims to make `KubernetesExecutor`'s `multi_namespace_mode` work without cluster-scope role.\r\n\r\n(This was discussed at the mail list at https://lists.apache.org/thread/xxsppw7qwvky78l6nx41vlz593gj4zqb)\r\n\r\nI'm sure folks would have suggestions and we need to future refine this change, but I would like to bring up the discussion by creating this PR first.\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\nAdvantages this change brings:\r\n- Better fits enterprise environment\r\n- Better security: limit the permissions that the Scheduler Pod needs, so that it doesn't have too much permissions which it doesn't have to have (earlier it has to have a cluster role in order to use `multi_namespace_mode`)","created_at":"2022-12-02T03:03:42Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T09:45:22Z","closed_at":"2022-12-10T06:51:01Z","merged_at":"2022-12-10T06:51:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"c739a6a08790423ba1e38464a15c4bac078277d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including
