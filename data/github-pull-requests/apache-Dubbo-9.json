contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-31T10:52:19Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T16:04:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e84ce377e2f75b03cd41703c3ff55cefc5fb52a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDE5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/don%E2%80%99t-merge","name":"status/don’t-merge","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":"No

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-23T03:15:32Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T12:53:33Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a9cf6fe718436d505b4caadeb8d58a2c8ac01f5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13685/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13685/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13685/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/53f94ca37bd25d24b631fcca2f059ba4609f73cd","head":{"label":"xieshouyu:bugfix/OnlyConsumersNeedRegistryInstance","ref":"bugfix/OnlyConsumersNeedRegistryInstance","sha":"53f94ca37bd25d24b631fcca2f059ba4609f73cd","user":{"login":"xieshouyu","id":29672850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjcyODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29672850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu","html_url":"https://github.com/xieshouyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":580273067,"node_id":"R_kgDOIpZDqw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xieshouyu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xieshouyu","id":29672850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjcyODUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29672850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu","html_url":"https://github.com/xieshouyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshouyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xieshouyu/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-18T06:12:37Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T02:44:09Z","closed_at":"2024-01-31T02:37:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa8fcbd491f8572e3698ab1dc7ddd138e394a3f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13674/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13674/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13674/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/dacb2ba43e51f3ee31a4a252cf30c99b22d776b3","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/native_enum","ref":"fix/native_enum","sha":"dacb2ba43e51f3ee31a4a252cf30c99b22d776b3","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-13T10:02:04Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T08:55:23Z","closed_at":"2024-01-17T08:55:23Z","merged_at":"2024-01-17T08:55:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d37c4e08310576e4a8032b9bd02bf7c6493365e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13646/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13646/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13646/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c6376aa03f4c8dcb7034d8fd2d46dc588ee4c196","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0113-test","ref":"0113-test","sha":"c6376aa03f4c8dcb7034d8fd2d46dc588ee4c196","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-09T13:24:46Z","updated_at":"2024-01-21T02:47:54Z","closed_at":"2024-01-09T13:34:28Z","merged_at":"2024-01-09T13:34:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"50612ad3a73d313d11a045a829d6129290ccc9cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13634/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13634/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13634/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/64064a704bd444f670e235ff9a8ff3009a1e6f95","head":{"label":"wxbty:revert_13609_3","ref":"revert_13609_3","sha":"64064a704bd444f670e235ff9a8ff3009a1e6f95","user":{"login":"wxbty","id":38374721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mzc0NzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38374721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty","html_url":"https://github.com/wxbty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":622411536,"node_id":"R_kgDOJRk_EA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wxbty/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wxbty","id":38374721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4Mzc0NzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38374721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty","html_url":"https://github.com/wxbty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxbty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wxbty/dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-09T05:35:45Z","updated_at":"2024-01-12T17:58:59Z","closed_at":"2024-01-12T17:58:58Z","merged_at":"2024-01-12T17:58:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"df0de49b8c19cae9b9d1d1e4f6e3a37111c6f7ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDE5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/don%E2%80%99t-merge","name":"status/don’t-merge","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":"No

What is the purpose of the change\r\nWhen utilizing Dubbo REST with the @QueryParam annotation on parameters, issues with Chinese character decoding may arise. Refer to the [13349 issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/13349#issuecomment-1879523852) for a comprehensive and detailed description of the problem, including its cause, solution, and an explanation of why it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nRequestFacade.initParameters will decode the request uri with UTF-8 before parsing uri to parameters.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- I add more unit tests , then can pass, and I recommend you refer the [13349 issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/13349#issuecomment-1879523852) \r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-06T03:34:56Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T03:19:35Z","closed_at":"2024-01-19T03:19:35Z","merged_at":"2024-01-19T03:19:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a3ad4ab4151e672ffe3348d035ec44a31ee9c62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/67","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/67","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/67/labels","id":10336378,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Anbh6","number":67,"title":"3.2.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":23,"state":"closed","created_at":"2023-12-21T02:07:31Z","updated_at":"2024-02-19T02:05:33Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-02-19T02:05:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13617/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13617/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13617/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6acc3cccef90c5e8742d5d3c4c5c0a0993ce0404","head":{"label":"MajaChen:hotfix_rest_encoding","ref":"hotfix_rest_encoding","sha":"6acc3cccef90c5e8742d5d3c4c5c0a0993ce0404","user":{"login":"MajaChen","id":53480612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDgwNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53480612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen","html_url":"https://github.com/MajaChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":713379590,"node_id":"R_kgDOKoVPBg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"MajaChen/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MajaChen","id":53480612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDgwNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53480612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen","html_url":"https://github.com/MajaChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MajaChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MajaChen/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-04T03:53:24Z","updated_at":"2024-03-01T03:01:10Z","closed_at":"2024-03-01T03:01:10Z","merged_at":"2024-03-01T03:01:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"8fb22934d1c89cfb07e3566a138a3a5962055ebb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/68","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/68","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/68/labels","id":10476983,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4An923","number":68,"title":"3.2.14","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":3,"closed_issues":19,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-01-27T13:38:55Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T01:49:06Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13612/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13612/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13612/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b37a087542c331b875dbef6048d6b4d670050632","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:3.2_feat/Upgrade_apache_parent_version","ref":"3.2_feat/Upgrade_apache_parent_version","sha":"b37a087542c331b875dbef6048d6b4d670050632","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-03T15:00:35Z","updated_at":"2024-02-01T06:00:17Z","closed_at":"2024-02-01T06:00:17Z","merged_at":"2024-02-01T06:00:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"2dde7ac09eee12618725d5279f971b2a44ab599b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13607/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13607/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13607/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a56c34d82b321c159dbde2da035f8ac03cb23202","head":{"label":"oxsean:feature-13427-triple-convergence-rest","ref":"feature-13427-triple-convergence-rest","sha":"a56c34d82b321c159dbde2da035f8ac03cb23202","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Brief changelog\r\n\r\nignore test method when  extensionLoader inject instance.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-03T07:16:36Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T03:27:49Z","closed_at":"2024-01-10T03:27:48Z","merged_at":"2024-01-10T03:27:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"966efaab85a30d3d9339093381a7b069c2d71c64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13601/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13601/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13601/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/df26a03df9c10db19a2ca1bc9c5869b9a13b2ea7","head":{"label":"vio-lin:fix-invoke-test-method","ref":"fix-invoke-test-method","sha":"df26a03df9c10db19a2ca1bc9c5869b9a13b2ea7","user":{"login":"vio-lin","id":12695349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk1MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12695349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/vio-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140425453,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA0MjU0NTM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"vio-lin/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vio-lin","id":12695349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk1MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12695349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/vio-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vio-lin/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-02T15:40:23Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T16:07:52Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T16:07:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f751f953312677379c9d114bce2c5ef4b89abe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13599/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13599/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13599/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/11f6802419d09fc8406c2dbded8bb0d60ebc6319","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/20240102_fix_okhttp_restclient_oversize_create","ref":"feature/20240102_fix_okhttp_restclient_oversize_create","sha":"11f6802419d09fc8406c2dbded8bb0d60ebc6319","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"1bdbfd864740f6023762b788c7ae0d42f00fd5d6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-02T08:27:42Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T09:11:42Z","closed_at":"2024-01-02T08:47:08Z","merged_at":"2024-01-02T08:47:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"011d6e0a718280433aeb2e777366e55b20a51cfe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13595/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13595/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13595/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/12dfeee2929ec1e07cccc8fd1f076c295d6ac22f","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0102-param","ref":"0102-param","sha":"12dfeee2929ec1e07cccc8fd1f076c295d6ac22f","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Brief changelog\r\n\r\nignore test method when  extensionLoader inject instance.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-29T05:45:23Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T03:48:24Z","closed_at":"2024-01-02T03:48:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71688a52b72f35cd769557d501a471e95464838e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13590/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13590/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13590/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2f143536b10f9dfa4237fc41528965354d42e9e8","head":{"label":"vio-lin:fix-invoke-test-method","ref":"fix-invoke-test-method","sha":"2f143536b10f9dfa4237fc41528965354d42e9e8","user":{"login":"vio-lin","id":12695349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk1MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12695349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/vio-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140425453,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA0MjU0NTM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"vio-lin/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vio-lin","id":12695349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk1MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12695349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/vio-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vio-lin/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-26T16:04:49Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T15:18:28Z","closed_at":"2023-12-27T15:18:28Z","merged_at":"2023-12-27T15:18:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"501a7a7653bc8db09a46db3541109266e6a1a90b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/67","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/67","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/67/labels","id":10336378,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Anbh6","number":67,"title":"3.2.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":23,"state":"closed","created_at":"2023-12-21T02:07:31Z","updated_at":"2024-02-19T02:05:33Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-02-19T02:05:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/57de2581722f2335594cfd1753526a68b6049446","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/20231226_resteasy_response_statuscode_support","ref":"feature/20231226_resteasy_response_statuscode_support","sha":"57de2581722f2335594cfd1753526a68b6049446","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"1368e21d9bb1afda195b0411091cb90003658456","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-26T03:07:07Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T15:20:17Z","closed_at":"2023-12-27T15:20:10Z","merged_at":"2023-12-27T15:20:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"745ba45ea4cc260c1019c58eeb17dfcccf06b09b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/67","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/67","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/67/labels","id":10336378,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Anbh6","number":67,"title":"3.2.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":23,"state":"closed","created_at":"2023-12-21T02:07:31Z","updated_at":"2024-02-19T02:05:33Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-02-19T02:05:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13580/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13580/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13580/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f80d2d0ed17efcf0d346e6bb2aa0aaf543f7b8f6","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1226-metrics","ref":"1226-metrics","sha":"f80d2d0ed17efcf0d346e6bb2aa0aaf543f7b8f6","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-22T13:21:57Z","updated_at":"2023-12-26T09:31:45Z","closed_at":"2023-12-26T09:31:45Z","merged_at":"2023-12-26T09:31:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"1368e21d9bb1afda195b0411091cb90003658456","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13557/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13557/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13557/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c0bb40699779ae20effc28415abb096c3a45b901","head":{"label":"SpringStudent:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"c0bb40699779ae20effc28415abb096c3a45b901","user":{"login":"SpringStudent","id":14833956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODMzOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14833956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent","html_url":"https://github.com/SpringStudent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":734725264,"node_id":"R_kgDOK8sEkA","name":"dubbo3.2.10","full_name":"SpringStudent/dubbo3.2.10","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SpringStudent","id":14833956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODMzOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14833956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent","html_url":"https://github.com/SpringStudent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SpringStudent/dubbo3.2.10","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-21T06:08:32Z","updated_at":"2023-12-21T07:04:14Z","closed_at":"2023-12-21T07:04:09Z","merged_at":"2023-12-21T07:04:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb8d7a36f92c54ede87a05ddee62253ebc93db12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13551/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13551/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13551/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8a1dac97df7794f2cc602479d1b93041f33c9f22","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/demo_native","ref":"fix/demo_native","sha":"8a1dac97df7794f2cc602479d1b93041f33c9f22","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-21T03:16:10Z","updated_at":"2023-12-21T04:00:50Z","closed_at":"2023-12-21T03:16:51Z","merged_at":"2023-12-21T03:16:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"ff2bdd0229e9479d48fdd808c037d23a1cb17983","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13549/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13549/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13549/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/188aebc09d8eef8a0ed9c13364ebb6d127cdcb3c","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/change_bug_labels","ref":"feat/change_bug_labels","sha":"188aebc09d8eef8a0ed9c13364ebb6d127cdcb3c","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache
