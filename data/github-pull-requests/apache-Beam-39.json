up of StateFetcher\r\n\r\nChanges will need to be made to this (or possibly just make a new class that takes in a WindmillWorkItemClient instead of MetricTrackingWindmillServer to make GetData calls) to support direct path, so doing some clean up before introducing further changes in a later CLs.\r\n\r\n- Changed to not use `null` as a valid state.  Currently `null` is being used to represent the side input not being ready along side with `Optional<T>`, so the interface was returning a `@Nullable Optional<T>`.  Opted to expose the the `SideInput` instance directly, and checking for `ready` state instead of `null`.\r\n- some autoformatting was applied by the linter and spotless\r\n-  move the `StateFetcher` into its own directory under `/streaming/sideinput` for organization\r\n\r\nR: scwhittle\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
