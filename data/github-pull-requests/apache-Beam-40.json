`test-arguments-action` action to solve the following points:\r\n- Encapsulate common test arguments into one place\r\n- Apply arguments preparation logic (quotas, commas, etc.) to have a single template for creating config files for performance and load tests\r\n- Allows to specify arguments that are generated at runtime.\r\n\r\n### How has it been tested?\r\n\r\nThe jobs have been tested on Self-hosted GKE runners ubuntu 20.04.\r\nThe following test cases are passed:\r\n\r\n- by manually running the job (`workflow_dispatch`)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your

drain operation does not work for flink pipelines when RequiresStableInput annotation is used. This is caused due to buffered data not being processed before the final checkpoint operation that causes watermark hold related exception. This PR addresses this issue by processing the buffer before the final checkpoint completes. More context in #28554. \r\n\r\n----\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Pandas 2, groupby().apply() will append group keys to an index that already has them in cases where the apply is really a transform (the resulting index is same as the incoming one). This is a change from Pandas 1.5.  \r\n\r\nWhen running the original test with Pandas 1.5, we get the following warning:\r\n\r\n```FutureWarning: Not prepending group keys to the result index of transform-like apply. In the future, the group keys will be included in the index, regardless of whether the applied function returns a like-indexed object.\r\nTo preserve the previous behavior, use\r\n\r\n\t>>>

is another case of #20970 (harmless error logs with gRPC leak). \r\n\r\n`BigQueryIO.read()` with `Method.DIRECT_READ` in Dataflow **streaming** jobs can cause Dataflow to output the gRPC leak error logs like below. \r\n\r\nThis is because `getCheckpointMark()` in `BoundedToUnboundedSourceAdapter`  calls `init()` where `residualSource` field is updated, but it missed closing old `residualSource`, which caused a leak of `ResidualSource#reader` closing. The `reader` in the stacktrace below is `BigQueryStorageStreamReader`.  Not closing `BigQueryStorageStreamReader` causes the gRPC leak error logs. \r\n\r\n\r\nError mesasge:\r\n``` \r\n*~*~*~ Previous channel ManagedChannelImpl{logId=9,

PR allows prism to pass the 7 of the 8 tests in the [Basic Xlang tests](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/go/test/integration/xlang/xlang_test.go). This remains experimental for prism.\r\n\r\nFixes a bug in Go SDK iterators where io.EOF was getting incorrectly wrapped, preventing downstream behavior on iterator read calls. Triggered by the Java CoGBK transform results.\r\n\r\nTestXLang_CoGroupBy is the only one that doesn't pass at present, but passing CoGBKResult output over cross language boundaries is uncommon.  https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/28544 filed to resolve.\r\n\r\n* Allow startup and shutdown of multiple workers.\r\n  * Worker stop is cleaned up to occur on post job context cancellation, so Serving has moved to each environment.\r\n  * Open question: Maybe only start the worker for an environment if it executes something? GBK and Flatten are done runner side, and don't need their SDK environments...\r\n* Plumb through the \"correct\" worker for stages.\r\n* Allow prism to \"support\" Java CombineGlobally, and CombineByValues urns, by relying on the SDK backup implementation.\r\n  * Similarly \"support\" the FireAlways trigger, by not failing pipelines that use it. However Prism doesn't yet actually support trigger behavior, but since only a single \"ontime\" fireing is implemented, current behavior is compatible with those triggers.\r\n* Stage enumeration is now based on the Topological sort/from fusion output. \r\n* Minor error/shutdown logging improvements.  \r\n \r\nSee #28187\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

usability fixes for the prism debugz page.\r\n\r\n* Use humanize and time to improve display of Bytes, durations, and other numbers in the debugz page.\r\n* Move descriptions to hover tooltips & remove the extra column.\r\n  * Fix debugz table header to represent their contents.\r\n  * Due to the goroutine and build info being in the same table, it's still very wide. Those will be split into another table in a later improvement round.\r\n* Fix footer on index page so that it's always at the bottom, of either the screen or beneath the job table.\r\n\r\nNo screenshot available.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
