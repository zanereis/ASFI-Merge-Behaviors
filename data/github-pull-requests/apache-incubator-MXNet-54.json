Description ##\r\nThis implements a special version of AdaGrad with a learning rate per row instead of for every parameter. This is useful for learning large embedding matrices, as it significantly reduces the memory requirements for the state array as well as reduces over-fitting due to having less learning rates. Consequently only 2D weight arrays are supported.\r\n\r\n~~Compared to the AdaGrad optimizer already included in MXNet, this Optimizer also supports the group lasso proximal operator for inducing group sparsity, where each row of the weight is considered a group. As there is a single learning rate per group, we can use a [closed form solution for the proximal operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_gradient_methods_for_learning#Group_lasso) which is not possible if different learning rates are used for parameters within a single group.~~\r\nTo speed up merging this PR, the proximal implementation will be merged later, after the API for eager update is integrated with gluon trainer.\r\n\r\nThis Optimizer is useful for the GluonNLP project.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Add contrib.optimizer.GroupAdaGrad\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If you have any suggestions for the API naming or other suggestions pleas let me know.\r\n- ~~Forcing an eager update of the lazily accumulated group lasso regularization for a set of rows requires access to some private API.

Description ##\r\nAvoid implicit double conversions in legacy math operations.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\nNote:  After investigating this warning I'm not sure it's always applicable, however using std::math_func does catch some cases where double promotions happen.  It will also make sure we have uniform implementations across compilers that support the C++11 standard.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <cmath>\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    float input = 0.5f;\r\n    return

Description ##\r\n Fix flaky test: test_ndarray.test_order. Tracked in #12310\r\n\r\nThe test uses np.int16 which is not a supported dtype for ndarray.\r\nAlso, conversion of np array to ndarray defaults to float32 in destination ndarray even though the dtype of source could be anything leading to failure of unites due to loss of precision in some cases.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n--> Removed tests for np.int16\r\n--> Instead of using default dtype for converting arrays , used the type from source array to convert to target array.\r\n\r\nRan the test with changes for 5000 runs for different seeds and verified it.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-25T18:13:33Z","updated_at":"2018-09-29T00:03:59Z","closed_at":"2018-09-29T00:03:59Z","merged_at":"2018-09-29T00:03:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"4da3001e89e11aa489732950f3ab88da06e4317f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nUse modernized ranged loops where possible.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nRanged for loops are an addition to C++11 they made for dramatically easier to read C++ code.  Using range fors ensures that you're using a fast for loop implementation with proper caching of tracked loop vars.  It also helps avoid off-by-one bugs common when iterating using ++.  Clang-tidy does a good job at detecting where ranged-fors can be used.  This PR enables the check as an error when clang-tidy is reasonably sure that the C++ loop type could be a drop in replacement.\r\n\r\nI tried to also update for const correct references types in loops where I could.  I also attempted to spend some time looking at each loop to understand what it was doing, and to name variables in a way that would improve readability.","created_at":"2018-08-25T17:06:57Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T14:03:19Z","closed_at":"2018-11-19T14:03:18Z","merged_at":"2018-11-19T14:03:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"5a83b6b563211f430688e41eab4752c6de4ecf22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nReduce redundant copies and add a check to clang-tidy to prevent future redundant copies.  This change is a failure straightforward optimization that should not impact the correctness of the library.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\nNote: should only be applied after

Description ##\r\nThis PR changes a few NULL assignments to the more specific C++11 nullptr.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds mechanisms on the build scripts to cleanup docker containers when there is a cancellation, either from the user by sending SIGINT / SIGTERM or when the process inside the container ends with an error.\r\n\r\nIt also propagates the environment variables from Jenkins which are used by the process tree killer to identify runaway processes so processes inside the container are killed when the Jenkins job is stopped.\r\n\r\nWith this patch we catch SIGINT and SIGTERM and install a handler on atexit which cleans (stops) docker containers which were created during execution of the build.\r\n\r\nWe also switch to python docker API for better management of running containers.\r\n\r\n@aaronmarkham @marcoabreu @lebeg @KellenSunderland\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nMove F16C support detection to its own module. The support detection module is taken from the mshadow project's cmake.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Small refactor moving F16C support detection to its own cmake module\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-24T11:43:54Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T07:37:34Z","closed_at":"2018-11-01T14:40:26Z","merged_at":"2018-11-01T14:40:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e16cf66a54d5abf4068629fd447bec9ca40b665","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR builds on-top of current profiler support to allow profiling via NVIDIA's NVTX APIs.  These extensions mark readable ranges in the NVIDIA Visual Profiler which helps show correlations between kernel launches and graph node executions.\r\n\r\nExample shown here: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7443219/33946110-34296d18-e021-11e7-8d18-6d40b797405c.png  (The additional information enabled is in the 'Markers and Ranges' row.)\r\n\r\n## Checklist

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this changs\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* TODO: Integration

Also looked through PyLint issues that were only being flagged once in the code base to see if small changes code make the code compliant.  __Fixed__ via code changes:\r\n```\r\n************* Module setup\r\npython/setup.py:32:0: C0413: Import \"from setuptools import find_packages\" should be placed at the top of the module (wrong-import-position)\r\n************* Module mxnet.executor_manager\r\npython/mxnet/executor_manager.py:130:24: C0121: Comparison to False should be 'expr' or 'expr is not False' (singleton-comparison)\r\n************* Module mxnet.model\r\npython/mxnet/model.py:136:16: W1508: os.getenv default type is builtins.int. Expected str or None. (invalid-envvar-default)\r\npython/mxnet/model.py:192:0: R1711: Useless return at end of function or method (useless-return)\r\n************* Module mxnet.gluon.rnn.rnn_cell\r\npython/mxnet/gluon/rnn/rnn_cell.py:253:4: R0911: Too many return statements (7/6) (too-many-return-statements)\r\n************* Module

Description ##\r\nImplement mkldnn convlution fusion(eg. conv+relu, conv+bn, conv+sum) based on subgraph.\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @zheng-da @reminisce \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-23T08:37:51Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T00:32:12Z","closed_at":"2018-10-10T00:32:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce33290d6ceb8adfcaa05bc1115ee76f8fb14207","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nSupport softmin function: https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/nn/functional.html#softmin\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Softmin operator\r\n- [x] Corresponding unit tests\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nPassed more than 10000 trials on both CPU &

Description ##\r\nClang 6 has now been officially released (as of July 5th, 2018).  It will be a very popular compiler in the future, and we should adopt it in CI to try and guarantee the maximum amount of forwards compatibility possible for releases.\r\n\r\nhttp://releases.llvm.org/6.0.1/tools/clang/docs/ReleaseNotes.html\r\n\r\nClang 6 contains better tooling, more openmp support and improved sanitizers which may be interesting for the MXNet project.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-08-23T06:48:26Z","updated_at":"2018-08-23T11:13:12Z","closed_at":"2018-08-23T11:13:12Z","merged_at":"2018-08-23T11:13:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"72efe41c5e0f1c7bbf7cf328f17fc93edc4ce76b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/60f0d165685a7ca71a1a3038f1b365861a88585d","head":{"label":"KellenSunderland:clang-6","ref":"clang-6","sha":"60f0d165685a7ca71a1a3038f1b365861a88585d","user":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104731717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQ3MzE3MTc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nFix for #11709.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Get rid of fixed seed\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nPassed more than 10000 trials on CPU & GPU:\r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_COUNT=10000 nosetests -s

Description ##\r\nDefine cmp() in Python 3\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Define cmp() in Python 3\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@marcoabreu

Description ##\r\nFix #11710.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Get rid of unnecessary repeat in the test\r\n- [x] Get rid of fixed seed to re-enable randomized testing\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested on CPU for more than 10000 trials:\r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_COUNT=10000 nosetests -s --verbose

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes the issues #9067 and #8799 where gradient computation for operators with multiple output fails in ndarray if the dtype is not float32. \r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue is that a _zeros operator was added for the other don't care output. The _zeros operator uses float32 dtype by default and it will cause conflict if the dtype in ndarray is not float32. My solution is to create a new _zeros_without_dtype operator that does not take any default dtype and use it to replace the _zeros operator in the computation graph. This change solves the dtype conflict problem and should be backward compatible.  \r\n\r\nA unit test is added to test this fix.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Change the way to infer type for auto-derived zero operator in nnvm::Graph\r\n- [X] Added a unittest for operators with multioutput.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This seems to be a general problem for all multioutput operators when computing gradient in imperative mode. A simple example is copied from the original issue below:\r\n- Although the change is small, the impact could be large. Thus thorough review is solicited.\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nfrom mxnet import autograd\r\n\r\n\r\ndata = mx.nd.arange(16, dtype='float64').reshape((4, 4))\r\ndata.attach_grad()\r\n\r\nwith

Description ##\r\nUpdate some behaviors of NDArrayIter.\r\n- Change the functionality of class NDArrayIter `last_batch_handle = roll_over`.\r\n- Change the timing of shuffling. Previously, it shuffles only during the initialization, which didn't meet training needs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- shuffle when calling the reset.\r\n- when last_batch_handle is roll_over, the last batch should be rolled over to next epoch\r\n- add the unit test for three `last_batch_handle` params\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nFix for issue #7533 Call symbol/nd.smooth_l1 without scalar causing uncaught exception\r\n\r\nchanged smooth_l1 operator implementation to not use helper macros since\r\nthey do not provide enough support for checking for arguments and\r\nsetting custom default values\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nchanged smooth_l1 operator implementation to not use helper macros since\r\nthey do not provide enough

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis integrates clang-tidy into our CI system.  Clang-tidy is a modern c++ linting and static-analysis tool that can find issues in our native codebase.  It can also be used to modernize the codebase, suggesting improvements to adopt features that have been added to the C++11 standard.\r\n\r\nThis initial integration marks many rules as warnings and only targets cpu builds for our core native codebase.  I'd like to try and introduce this as a minimum useful change.  As we fix warnings we can move rules to errors in the configuration to protect against regressions.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-08-21T20:07:04Z","updated_at":"2018-08-27T11:18:14Z","closed_at":"2018-08-27T11:18:14Z","merged_at":"2018-08-27T11:18:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f7395877b8271ded36dbf9155437b613dd8df8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/befd931866aed587343f08b31ec49be8c8193e58","head":{"label":"KellenSunderland:clang_tidy","ref":"clang_tidy","sha":"befd931866aed587343f08b31ec49be8c8193e58","user":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104731717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQ3MzE3MTc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatar

Description ##\r\nRe-enbling KVstore test. Since its no longer reproducible. Will have to observe whether it still fails after enabling it or not.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-21T18:51:50Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T16:22:42Z","closed_at":"2018-08-22T16:22:42Z","merged_at":"2018-08-22T16:22:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"c1a89488ef551f441dbdf1c5107694680ce1d340","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12279/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12279/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12279/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/e3a1aaa6e87a47c730d13f7d7d81cafa3c140eb2","head":{"label":"access2rohit:master","ref":"master","sha":"e3a1aaa6e87a47c730d13f7d7d81cafa3c140eb2","user":{"login":"access2rohit","id":22431729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDMxNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22431729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit","html_url":"https://github.com/access2rohit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137944048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzc5NDQwNDg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"access2rohit/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"access2rohit","id":22431729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDMxNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22431729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit","html_url":"https://github.com/access2rohit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/access2rohit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/access2rohit/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nRemove PyLint disable directives that the codebase is not violating.  This tightens up the linting of future proposed changes.  Also looked through PyLint issues that were only being flagged once in the code base to see if small changes code make the code compliant.  __Fixed__ via code changes:\r\n```\r\n************* Module setup\r\npython/setup.py:32:0: C0413: Import \"from setuptools import find_packages\" should be placed at the top of the module (wrong-import-position)\r\n************* Module mxnet.executor_manager\r\npython/mxnet/executor_manager.py:130:24: C0121: Comparison to False should be 'expr' or 'expr is not False' (singleton-comparison)\r\n************* Module mxnet.model\r\npython/mxnet/model.py:136:16: W1508: os.getenv default type is builtins.int. Expected str or None. (invalid-envvar-default)\r\npython/mxnet/model.py:192:0: R1711: Useless return at end of function or method (useless-return)\r\n************* Module mxnet.gluon.rnn.rnn_cell\r\npython/mxnet/gluon/rnn/rnn_cell.py:253:4: R0911: Too many return statements (7/6) (too-many-return-statements)\r\n************* Module mxnet.image.detection\r\npython/mxnet/image/detection.py:311:16: R0916: Too many boolean expressions in if statement (6/5) (too-many-boolean-expressions)\r\n```\r\n\r\n@vandanavk \r\n\r\n## Checklist

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds mechanisms on the build scripts to cleanup docker containers when there is a cancellation, either from the user by sending SIGINT / SIGTERM or when the process inside the container ends with an error.\r\n\r\nIt also propagates the environment variables from Jenkins which are used by the process tree killer to identify runaway processes so processes inside the container are killed when the Jenkins job is stopped.\r\n\r\nWith this patch we catch SIGINT and SIGTERM and install a handler on atexit which cleans (stops) docker containers which were created during execution of the build.\r\n\r\nWe also switch to python docker API for better management of running containers.\r\n\r\n@aaronmarkham @marcoabreu @lebeg @KellenSunderland\r\n\r\n## Checklist

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds mechanisms on the build scripts to cleanup docker containers when there is a cancellation, either from the user by sending SIGINT / SIGTERM or when the process inside the container ends with an error.\r\n\r\nIt also propagates the environment variables from Jenkins which are used by the process tree killer to identify runaway processes so processes inside the container are killed when the Jenkins job is stopped.\r\n\r\nWith this patch we catch SIGINT and SIGTERM and install a handler on atexit which cleans (stops) docker containers which were created during execution of the build.\r\n\r\nWe also switch to python docker API for better management of running containers.\r\n\r\n@aaronmarkham @marcoabreu @lebeg @KellenSunderland\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-21T15:45:41Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T18:44:44Z","closed_at":"2018-08-21T16:01:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12275/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12275/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12275/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/10a0b2c38e2eaa8a303f265c2abba48b25a1a195","head":{"label":"larroy:zombies_dev","ref":"zombies_dev","sha":"10a0b2c38e2eaa8a303f265c2abba48b25a1a195","user":{"login":"larroy","id":928489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy","html_url":"https://github.com/larroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77059342,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzA1OTM0Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"larroy/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"larroy","id":928489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/928489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy","html_url":"https://github.com/larroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/larroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/larroy/mxnet","description":"This

Description ##\r\nUpdate onnx-tensorrt to most recent version.  This new version contains some fixes for build errors and addresses a few bugs.  There's a minor interface change needed for the createParser interface.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n*  Tested this on 10 full CI builds internally without any errors.\r\n\r\n@marcoabreu

Description ##\r\nThis PR will pin our dockcross base images to known working versions.  Pinning these images is necessary as we've had cases where following the 'latest' tag in dockerhub leads us to picking up broken, or incompatible images.  Though the dockcross images are generally high-quality we'd like to avoid these issues from blocking our CI in the future.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage here is that we will lose visibility in valid failures for things like new cmake versions that potentially break on ARM builds.  We feel that these test should be done independently of PR validation, and would be best suited for the nightly test runs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nupdate mkldnn submodule to 0.16\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] update mkldnn submodule to 0.16\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-20T22:39:26Z","updated_at":"2018-10-23T23:14:23Z","closed_at":"2018-09-24T18:38:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"232b3754108d87c7496a3ecfa6008ad927ed135f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nTemporarily disable ARMv7 builds\r\n\r\nThis PR temporarily disables ARMv7 builds.  These builds seem to be braking based on a recent dependency change.  We'll address the broken dependency, but as an interim solution I recommend disabling the build.\r\n\r\nMitigates: #12258\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Note: I noticed a similar issue earlier in the day with another build locally.  I'm wondering if we might see more of these after caches expire.  It would be great if others could test local builds.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-20T21:44:13Z","updated_at":"2018-08-20T23:53:55Z","closed_at":"2018-08-20T23:53:55Z","merged_at":"2018-08-20T23:53:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4aced7123ba8aba13f0525276c909f4a78a04ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12260/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12260/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12260/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4be23250cdb0af5f8c0895d2edceb0ba27e87d0c","head":{"label":"KellenSunderland:disable_armv7","ref":"disable_armv7","sha":"4be23250cdb0af5f8c0895d2edceb0ba27e87d0c","user":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104731717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQ3MzE3MTc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-20T18:29:52Z","updated_at":"2018-09-19T23:00:10Z","closed_at":"2018-08-21T15:49:44Z","merged_at":"2018-08-21T15:49:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"8dbbfad36caffedba08f31c6ef420cda62909c8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12256/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12256/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12256/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/26082ea07e2a23be37f23a27e45244d9bf51a007","head":{"label":"lanking520:link-fixer","ref":"link-fixer","sha":"26082ea07e2a23be37f23a27e45244d9bf51a007","user":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123362138,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMzNjIxMzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"lanking520/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nContinue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11134\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Arbitrary dtype of indices for ordering operators, tests\r\n- [x] For topk, argsort, add the dtype option to specify the type of the output indices, tests\r\n- [x] Fix the bug that ordering ops do not support kNullOp, tests\r\n- [x] Fix the doc of topk to state the the elements are sorted.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Currently, the operator do not support to have input dtype=float16.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-20T13:57:43Z","updated_at":"2018-08-25T19:34:55Z","closed_at":"2018-08-22T23:35:26Z","merged_at":"2018-08-22T23:35:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"08f1c2dcba897ccf9568079e198ceb537ec388d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12250/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12250/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12250/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/b753502d9b736824713db512c956ba4d2eda06ab","head":{"label":"sxjscience:fix_order2","ref":"fix_order2","sha":"b753502d9b736824713db512c956ba4d2eda06ab","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44923569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDkyMzU2OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sxjscience/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience/mxnet","description":"

] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-19T12:29:02Z","updated_at":"2018-08-19T16:44:24Z","closed_at":"2018-08-19T16:44:24Z","merged_at":"2018-08-19T16:44:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"338a40b839436fb79eac51709c1323405a795aff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/12246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/12246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/36a254d34f34f7bf57cd4e423d511f6eeba43fc3","head":{"label":"KellenSunderland:disable_psroi","ref":"disable_psroi","sha":"36a254d34f34f7bf57cd4e423d511f6eeba43fc3","user":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104731717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQ3MzE3MTc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KellenSunderland","id":7443219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7443219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland","html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KellenSunderland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KellenSunderland/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nCurrently import mxnet causes warnings.filterwarnings('default', category=DeprecationWarning) to be executed.\r\nThis is very bad, as there are valid use cases where our users may have decided to filter out DeprecationWarning and we should not overwrite their configuration.\r\n\r\nIt is also not always possible for users to change the warnings filter after mxnet has changed it. Consider a package that relies on mxnet (such as https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp ) but also imports third-party packages that may raise warnings. If now gluon-nlp is imported, mxnet will overwrite the warnings filter and the user has no option to change it back to whatever settings he needs before gluon-nlp goes on to import other packages that may raise warnings.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Don't overwride global warnings.filterwarnings filter\r\n\r\n### Comments ###\r\n@szha This breaks our notebooks for KDD18\r\n@Roshrini  Can we get this into mxnet 1.3 please?

Description ##\r\nThis PR disables TRT.  It can be used to remove flakiness in our CI if https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12225 does not resolve our issues.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge,

Description ##\r\nFix for #11711.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Re-enable randomized test_operator/test_operator_gpu.test_bilinear_sampler\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nTested with more than 10000 trials on both CPU & GPU:\r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_COUNT=10000 nosetests -s --verbose

Description ##\r\nThis removes a race condition in onnx build.  This is a work around, the correct fix should be made to the onnx repo.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This commit decreases the number of workers during the onnx buil but this should have minimal impact on overall build times.  Building the onnx native lib only takes a few seconds.\r\n\r\nShould address #12234","created_at":"2018-08-17T17:03:42Z","updated_at":"2018-08-18T00:42:13Z","closed_at":"2018-08-18T00:42:13Z","merged_at":"2018-08-18T00:42:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"1355bd7821f8575a4cde9e0459e5a6ef680116a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis commit works around a race condition in the onnx project that was causing some TensorRT build failures.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this
