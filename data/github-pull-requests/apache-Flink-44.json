in the TimeIndicatorTypeInfo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Revert the API change in the #21182 to use the origin LongSerializer.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

\"forwardport\" PR for the 1.15 parent PR #19853\r\n\r\nThis change fixes a bug in dead code. The bug is not relevant right now because we deactivated the legacy leader election completely with FLINK-25806\r\n\r\nWhy do we need this?\r\nRefactoring the leader election for [FLIP-285](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-285%3A+Refactoring+LeaderElection+to+make+Flink+support+multi-component+leader+election+out-of-the-box)/[FLINK-26522](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-26522) is kind of tricky. I'm trying to slice the code changes into meaningful commits (and ideally dedicated PRs) to make the review process easier.\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue when refactoring the code and merging classes into one which also required adapting tests. This revealed the inconsistency/bug in the `ZooKeeperLeaderElectionDriver` implementation. Merging the bugfixes into 1.17 and 1.16 makes the other changes more reasonable/consistent.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this bug was revealed in `ZooKeeperLeaderElectionTest.testLeaderShouldBeCorrectedWhenOverwritten` when changing from the deprecated `NodeCache` to `CuratorCache`. The new `CuratorCacheListener` allows to be more selective on whether we expect a node creation or change which causes a test failure.

\"forwardport\" PR for the 1.15 parent PR #19853\r\n\r\nThis change fixes a bug in dead code. The bug is not relevant because we deactiveated the legacy leader election completely with [FLINK-25806](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-25806)\r\n\r\nWhy do we need this?\r\nRefactoring the leader election for [FLIP-285](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-285%3A+Refactoring+LeaderElection+to+make+Flink+support+multi-component+leader+election+out-of-the-box)/[FLINK-26522](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-26522) is kind of tricky. I'm trying to slice the code changes into meaningful commits (and ideally dedicated PRs) to make the review process easier.\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue when refactoring the code and merging classes into one which also required adapting tests. This revealed the inconsistency/bug in the `ZooKeeperLeaderElectionDriver` implementation. Merging the bugfixes into 1.17 and 1.16 makes the other changes more reasonable/consistent.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, this bug was revealed in `ZooKeeperLeaderElectionTest.testLeaderShouldBeCorrectedWhenOverwritten` when changing from the deprecated `NodeCache` to `CuratorCache`. The new `CuratorCacheListener` allows to be more selective on whether we expect a node creation or change which causes a test failure. The previous test implementation worked because we sent the 2nd write operation after writing the leader information which caused a node-change event and, after all, made the test pass.","created_at":"2023-02-01T17:11:51Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T08:27:19Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T08:27:19Z","merged_at":"2023-02-03T08:27:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"d76214de330fea485f2971b51c172420dfdf500b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9de76e438bae56f647b037d3323250e0ee157749","head":{"label":"XComp:FLINK-27848","ref":"FLINK-27848","sha":"9de76e438bae56f647b037d3323250e0ee157749","user":{"login":"XComp","id":1101012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDEwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1101012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp","html_url":"https://github.com/XComp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":283817011,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODM4MTcwMTE=","name":"flink","full_name":"XComp/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XComp","id":1101012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDEwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1101012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp","html_url":"https://github.com/XComp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XComp/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIf TM is materialized before receiving confirm(), the previously uploaded queue in `FsStateChangelogWriter` will be cleared, so the local files of the completed checkpoint will not be registered again, while the JM owned files are registered before confirm(), and do not depend on the uploaded queue, so the local files are deleted, and the DFS files are still there. \r\nThis PR makes the local recovery files registered before confirm() to avoid this problem. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Replace registering local files in confirm() with  registering local files in buildSnapshotResult().\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `ChangelogLocalRecoveryITCase`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-01T10:37:16Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T07:06:35Z","closed_at":"2023-08-29T08:37:17Z","merged_at":"2023-08-29T08:37:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"c23a3002b837ecffa2d561a405c17c979c814c6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21822/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21822/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21822/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9eb597668c67649e0175af3db89aa66789961d22","head":{"label":"fredia:donot_abort_cl","ref":"donot_abort_cl","sha":"9eb597668c67649e0175af3db89aa66789961d22","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pr is aims to fix IOException due to network buffer insufficient for jira: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues/FLINK-30727?filter=allopenissues](url).  This error is caused by some ITCase neither extends `StreamingTestBase`/`BatchTestBase`  nor sets the default parallelism manually in ITCase.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nModify ITCase  base `JoinReorderITCaseBase` and `StatisticsReportTestBase`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI run `mvn verify` with this pr in a machine with high cpu cores many times. The result is stable.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-01T10:19:44Z","updated_at":"2023-02-02T12:20:58Z","closed_at":"2023-02-02T12:20:58Z","merged_at":"2023-02-02T12:20:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ac2c330bad3f7d41721232397581b682ee7d64a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21821/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21821/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21821/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/14c3706d8848c8939d87ac0b6358920792915e54","head":{"label":"swuferhong:hotfix-itcase-failed","ref":"hotfix-itcase-failed","sha":"14c3706d8848c8939d87ac0b6358920792915e54","user":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373063159,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzMwNjMxNTk=","name":"flink","full_name":"swuferhong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong/flink","description":"Apache

writer is already closed`\r\n\r\nBoth of these exceptions are caused by cancelling task:\r\n1. The `java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException` is because `IOManagerAsync` has an async reader thread, and the async reader thread has not completely exited when the main thead close the file\r\n2. The `java.lang.IllegalStateException: File writer is already closed` is because the partition file was closed during writing. Currently in Flink, deploying a task and then immediately canceling it, the \"cancel\" may arrive before \"deploy\" because \"cancel\" and \"deploy\" are sent in two different threads. In this case, the JM thinks the task has been canceled, but the task deployment then reaches the TM and starts running the task. Then JM sends a release partitions call (because JM thinks the task is canceled), but at this time the task is running on TM, which will cause this exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**no**)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**no**)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**no**)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (**no**)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

should only be called if the handler (i.e. DefaultLeaderElectionService) is actually the leader. This check is already implemented in the corresponding calling methods of the MultipleComponentLeaderElectionDriver implementations. But these methods only schedule the logic rather than executing it right away. The execution is handled in a separate thread (i.e. DefaultMultipleComponentLeaderElectionService#leadershipOperationExecutor). That might create a race condition if a leader change is queued up already but not performed, yet, before the leader information change event gets queued up as well.\r\n\r\n1.16 backport PR of parent

should only be called if the handler (i.e. DefaultLeaderElectionService) is actually the leader. This check is already implemented in the corresponding calling methods of the MultipleComponentLeaderElectionDriver implementations. But these methods only schedule the logic rather than executing it right away. The execution is handled in a separate thread (i.e. DefaultMultipleComponentLeaderElectionService#leadershipOperationExecutor). That might create a race condition if a leader change is queued up already but not performed, yet, before the leader information change event gets queued up as well.\r\n\r\n1.15 backport PR of parent

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the getSchedulerType when test with flink.tests.enable-adaptive-scheduler\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**)\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-01T06:23:53Z","updated_at":"2024-07-23T04:07:37Z","closed_at":"2023-02-04T02:12:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38d9f3f3ffff8927e1779c220d13688ee860bade","assignee":{"login":"zhuzhurk","id":5869249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjkyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5869249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuzhurk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zhuzhurk","id":5869249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjkyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5869249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuzhurk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/91d7e36fdc58884e7e59857d60d3d8a120a86039","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:FLINK-30846","ref":"FLINK-30846","sha":"91d7e36fdc58884e7e59857d60d3d8a120a86039","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github

Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-31T14:41:30Z","updated_at":"2023-02-02T09:41:18Z","closed_at":"2023-02-02T09:41:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c699fb543872a8d9e8da06d76b96054077c5d16a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21810/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21810/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21810/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/27ff19f4c32508c82379e8076975814cc21ef630","head":{"label":"swuferhong:test-joinReorder","ref":"test-joinReorder","sha":"27ff19f4c32508c82379e8076975814cc21ef630","user":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":373063159,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzMwNjMxNTk=","name":"flink","full_name":"swuferhong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"swuferhong","id":27358654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzU4NjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27358654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong","html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swuferhong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/swuferhong/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n> The analysis below was initially made by @SmirAlex in #21365\r\n\r\nThis pull-request *tries to fix* unstable test `LookupJoinITCase` (error was not succeeded to be reproduced locally). An error contains the message 'Trying to access closed classloader'. However, test configured in the way that it loads cache only one time, and we wait until the end of this load in `LookupFullCache#open`. So `LookupFullCache#close` shouldn't somehow affect on cache load thread, if we assume that `close` is called only after `open`. \r\n\r\nDuring debugging it was found out that in `GenericRowDataKeySelector#open`, which executes inside separate reload thread, call of `Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()` returns `SubmoduleClassLoader` rather than `FlinkUserCodeClassLoader`, which is being returned from the same method inside main thread. *Probably*, this ClassLoader should not be there, and this is the core of the problem. Also it closely relates to the problem about classloader leak, described in option `CoreOptions#CHECK_LEAKED_CLASSLOADER`, to which error points out. \r\n\r\nThis change prevents from compiling a class in another separate thread, but rather do it just one time in main thread in `LookupFullCache#open` using provided userCodeClassLoader. Subsequent calls of `GeneratedProjection#newInstance` will end up with creating an instance from cached `Class<Projection>` without compilation or another interaction with context classloader. Note, that provided classloader is not stored anywhere, so classloader leak problem can't occur anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Compile Projection Class in main thread in `LookupFullCache#open` to avoid classloader leak\r\n  - Set context classloader to UserCodeClassLoader in `InputSplitCacheLoadTask`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n - This change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-31T10:26:31Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T04:04:19Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T04:04:19Z","merged_at":"2023-02-03T04:04:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"0516427d198420fa28d586ed052ef26daf2845ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21806/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21806/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21806/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9409c834398c927d9b86c2e236ab3f8e3c01f225","head":{"label":"PatrickRen:FLINK-29427","ref":"FLINK-29427","sha":"9409c834398c927d9b86c2e236ab3f8e3c01f225","user":{"login":"PatrickRen","id":18453087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDUzMDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18453087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrickRen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":241248347,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDEyNDgzNDc=","name":"flink","full_name":"PatrickRen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PatrickRen","id":18453087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDUzMDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18453087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrickRen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickRen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PatrickRen/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change enables `avro-confluent` format to deserialize schema ids that are stored with 8bytes on the message.\r\n\r\nIt will enable messages that got serialized  with Apicurio (which stores the schema id as a long) to be deserialized by the confluent schema registry (which stores the schema id as an int).\r\n\r\nIf the read integer read by schema id is equals to 0 (the four less significant bytes of a long), it will read another int (more four bytes) to ensure the schema id is properly read.\r\nThis is not a beautiful solution, but there is no way to store a schema id as zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Reads another integer from the message, if the schema id is zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added test that validates if a 8 byte schema id is readable*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): don't know\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-31T09:54:25Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T18:06:06Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb56a5e6256fd640f4a27d3045dc4b5532636d79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/247d16ea8049789a2d4338f68d03f2d0120a1273","head":{"label":"pedromazala:pedro/FLINK-30721","ref":"pedro/FLINK-30721","sha":"247d16ea8049789a2d4338f68d03f2d0120a1273","user":{"login":"pedromazala","id":2103162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2103162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala","html_url":"https://github.com/pedromazala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":595537841,"node_id":"R_kgDOI38vsQ","name":"flink","full_name":"pedromazala/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pedromazala","id":2103162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2103162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala","html_url":"https://github.com/pedromazala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedromazala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pedromazala/flink","description":"Apache

The issue can be reproduced by rolling back the changes made on the production files and then running the test, `stop job` will get stuck forever.\r\n\r\nThe fix can be verified by applying the fix and running the test again.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): No\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: No\r\n  - The serializers: No\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): No\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: No\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: No\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n  - Does this pull request introduces a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate documentation about the AdaptiveBatchScheduler\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nDocument change without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-31T07:59:13Z","updated_at":"2023-08-31T04:04:20Z","closed_at":"2023-02-09T03:18:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d164f3cd3b5fe5c2bf923628b200081b3d5b53f","assignee":{"login":"zhuzhurk","id":5869249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjkyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5869249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuzhurk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zhuzhurk","id":5869249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjkyNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5869249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuzhurk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuzhurk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/256dedb93dfe5e3bdaf543a96ff07cf40698dd15","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:FLINK-30838","ref":"FLINK-30838","sha":"256dedb93dfe5e3bdaf543a96ff07cf40698dd15","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/fl

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*We should shut down the executors when failed to creating the Executor. Shut down the ExecutorService can releases used system resources.*\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-31T07:28:04Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T01:26:55Z","closed_at":"2023-02-06T07:11:16Z","merged_at":"2023-02-06T07:11:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"152edf6a5e6f67a67a3d09815557b304bcd7b1a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/71050c06c55365e85dd5c9d3905b33aab1c70c55","head":{"label":"fsk119:fix-leak","ref":"fix-leak","sha":"71050c06c55365e85dd5c9d3905b33aab1c70c55","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Improve the sql client mode code structure.*\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-30T14:33:02Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T10:09:37Z","closed_at":"2023-02-01T10:09:31Z","merged_at":"2023-02-01T10:09:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"615fde6667a9a57be8cf308b1118171f8c812f13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21790/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21790/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21790/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ccdb60793993bdc819be1c42749bbf65ae4d2748","head":{"label":"fsk119:reorg","ref":"reorg","sha":"ccdb60793993bdc819be1c42749bbf65ae4d2748","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

 ## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nHadoop versions starting from 3.3.2 have reworked copying local files to remote using S3AFileSystem. Now it requires the passed local Hadoop Path to have a `scheme` specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nYarnApplicationFileUploader will append `file://` scheme for local path if none specified\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI manually tested on a local single-node Hadoop 3.3.4 cluster with `fs.defaultFS` pointing to a local Minio S3 server. Creating a Flink YARN session failed before the fix, but worked after.\r\n\r\nAlso added new unit test in `YarnApplicationFileUploaderTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) yes\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented) not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSimplify the configuration of adaptive batch scheduler\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1.Modify adaptive batch scheduler configuration default values\r\n2.Rename the configuration of adaptive batch scheduler\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?  not documented\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-30T11:08:38Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T15:30:16Z","closed_at":"2023-01-31T15:30:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b5225f420b217f340f556c0e51d44f5ac2f13f16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f827e589dd6eb02a02c4c59c754f320f39e12575","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:FLINK-30686","ref":"FLINK-30686","sha":"f827e589dd6eb02a02c4c59c754f320f39e12575","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix multiline statement printing results.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: add tests in the SqlClientTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-30T10:26:23Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T07:15:02Z","closed_at":"2023-02-01T07:14:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ed3d8eb4ee0cdbb8b90818f3acf08e4e1b80e55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21786/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21786/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21786/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bda4d868ead044759262fc5186037566b84a2fb7","head":{"label":"fsk119:execute-multi-statement","ref":"execute-multi-statement","sha":"bda4d868ead044759262fc5186037566b84a2fb7","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn order to chain operators together as much as possible, many downstream operators will use the parallelism of upstream input operators in the table planner.\r\n\r\nIf some operators need to have their own defined parallelism, the parallelism will be explicitly set. Therefore, the operator that takes the parallelism of the upstream operator as its own parallelism should be automatically derived by the AdaptiveBatchScheduler.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSet the parallelismConfigured of the operator whose parallelism is obtained from the parallelism of the upstream operator to false\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as e2e tpc-ds. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix maxParallelism is not forced to 1 after global partitioner.\r\nCurrently, the parallelism of global sort is set as 1, but the max parallelism is not set because ExecNodeBase#inputsContainSingleton does not work for global sort.  This works fine for the default scheduler, but may occur wrong result if  adaptive batch scheduler changes the global sort parallelism.* \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Make sure all Batch Exec Nodes implements SingleTransformationTranslator or MultipleTransformationTranslator*\r\n  - *set MaxParallelism to 1 if inputs has global partitioner in ExecNodeBase*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Extended ParallelismSettingTest to verify the changes*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*When connecting to the gateway, the client should check that the gateway version satisfies the requirements and then open the session later.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *ExecutorImplITCase#testConnectToEndpointWithV1Version*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-29T08:29:16Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T08:01:48Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T02:44:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1205d98b55e9b7b4962c901c6e70e58f1cf93a96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21776/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21776/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21776/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3adde025cde02f7352a4355bfa008556ff7ffdad","head":{"label":"fsk119:negotiate","ref":"negotiate","sha":"3adde025cde02f7352a4355bfa008556ff7ffdad","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo fix the class not found issue for flink hive3 connector\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- include `org.apache.thrift:libfb303` in pom.xml \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nVerify it by manually.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-29T02:27:55Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T07:29:17Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T07:28:11Z","merged_at":"2023-01-30T07:28:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1a9fe12f78999e555204a69d7e360705dc88450","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21775/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21775/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21775/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/23ea78073f644b8af4d8d080b63eedc23861af2e","head":{"label":"luoyuxia:FLINK-29878","ref":"FLINK-29878","sha":"23ea78073f644b8af4d8d080b63eedc23861af2e","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344411200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ0MTEyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"luoyuxia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nMigrates the existing examples to use the new `DataGeneratorSource` instead of `SourceFunction` and reimplements the `SocketSource(Function)` as the new Source . This change is required to unblock https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20049/files (CI checks do not allow usage of deprecated APIs in examples).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is covered by the existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-28T19:29:02Z","updated_at":"2023-06-28T02:14:33Z","closed_at":"2023-06-28T02:14:32Z","merged_at":"2023-06-28T02:14:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f5428ff1092ac0332c6712318f18a1483aed797","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272995158,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk1MTU4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Examples","name":"component=Examples","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21774/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21774/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21774/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2693232aa5bad5f6d2185ffe866e81ce2f14c40a","head":{"label":"afedulov:28227-examples","ref":"28227-examples","sha":"2693232aa5bad5f6d2185ffe866e81ce2f14c40a","user":{"login":"afedulov","id":1492164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1492164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov","html_url":"https://github.com/afedulov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161525880,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjE1MjU4ODA=","name":"flink","full_name":"afedulov/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"afedulov","id":1492164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1492164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov","html_url":"https://github.com/afedulov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afedulov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/afedulov/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change proposes to add a parallelismConfigured property as a flag to identify whether the parallelism of node is used \"parallelism.default\" or not. If the vertex's parallelismConfigured is true, the AdaptiveBatchScheduler will not automatically deciding parallelisms for it. Otherwise, AdaptiveBatchScheduler will automatically deciding parallelisms and use the \"parallelism.default\" as an alternative value for the \"jobmanager.adaptive-batch-scheduler.max-parallelism\".\r\n\r\nThis change will make user do not need to configure \"parallelism.default\" as \"-1\" to automatically deciding parallelisms for vertices.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce parallelismConfigured as a flag which operator used default parallelism and can automatically derive parallelism.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Introduce a specical `SessionManager` for the sql-client embedded mode, which require less resources and add Handler for REMOVE JAR statement.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *CliClientITCase*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-28T06:00:00Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T01:24:34Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T14:09:20Z","merged_at":"2023-01-30T14:09:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"c9e87fe410c42f7e7c19c81456d4212a58564f5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/df09d409129c75553bc38d708a551b387ace5946","head":{"label":"fsk119:remove-jars","ref":"remove-jars","sha":"df09d409129c75553bc38d708a551b387ace5946","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, below are the ways Python Worker gets the Python Flink Dependencies.\r\n\r\n1. Worker Node's System Python Path (/usr/local/lib64/python3.7/site-packages)\r\n2. Client passes the python Dependencies through `-pyfs` and `--pyarch` which is localised into `PYTHONPATH` of Python Worker.\r\n3. Client passes the requirements through `-requirement.txt` which gets installed on Worker Node and added into `PYTHONPATH` of Python Worker.\r\n\r\nThis change allow `PYTHONPATH` of Python Worker configurable where Admin/Service provider can install the required python Flink dependencies on a custom path (`/usr/lib/pyflink/lib/python3.7/site-packages`) on all Worker Nodes and then set the path in the client machine configuration `flink-conf.yaml`. This way it works without any configurations from the Application Users and also without affecting any other components dependent on System Python Path.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nadd an option to add in flink conf to pick configurable python path in worker and client.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIn `flink-conf.yaml` add the following configs:\r\n\r\n1. `python.client.executable: python3`\r\n2. `python.executable: python3`\r\n3. `python.pythonpath: /tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib64/python3.7/site-packages/:/tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib/python3.7/site-packages/`\r\n\r\n\r\n# Install PyFlink libraries on Client and Worker nodes\r\n```\r\n[hadoop@ip-172-1-2-3 flink]$ cat  /etc/flink/conf/req.txt\r\napache-flink==1.16.0\r\n```\r\nInstall python in all  worker nodes \r\n\r\n```\r\npython3 -m pip install --ignore-installed -r /tmp/req.txt --prefix /tmp/PYTHONPATH/\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun a job \r\n\r\n```\r\nflink run -py /usr/lib/flink/examples/python/table/word_count.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n# LOG \r\n\r\njobmanager log\r\n \r\n```\r\nobmanager.log:2023-02-23 07:09:30,931 INFO  org.apache.flink.configuration.GlobalConfiguration           [] - Loading configuration property: python.pythonpath, /tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib64/python3.7/site-packages/:/tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib/python3.7/site-packages/\r\njobmanager.log:2023-02-23 07:09:33,070 INFO  org.apache.flink.configuration.GlobalConfiguration           [] - Loading configuration property: python.pythonpath, /tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib64/python3.7/site-packages/:/tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib/python3.7/site-packages/\r\n```\r\n\r\ntaskmanager log \r\n\r\n```\r\ntaskmanager.log:2023-02-23 07:14:50,549 INFO  org.apache.flink.configuration.GlobalConfiguration           [] - Loading configuration property: python.pythonpath, /tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib64/python3.7/site-packages/:/tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib/python3.7/site-packages/\r\ntaskmanager.log:2023-02-23 07:14:53,978 INFO  org.apache.flink.python.env.AbstractPythonEnvironmentManager [] - PYTHONPATH of python worker: /tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib64/python3.7/site-packages/:/tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib/python3.7/site-packages/\r\ntaskmanager.log:2023-02-23 07:14:56,039 INFO  /tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib64/python3.7/site-packages/apache_beam/runners/worker/sdk_worker_main.py:84 [] - Logging handler created.\r\ntaskmanager.log:2023-02-23 07:14:56,039 INFO  /tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib64/python3.7/site-packages/apache_beam/runners/worker/sdk_worker_main.py:107 [] - semi_persistent_directory: /tmp\r\ntaskmanager.log:2023-02-23 07:14:56,039 WARN  /tmp/PYTHONPATH/lib64/python3.7/site-packages/apache_beam/runners/worker/sdk_worker_main.py:281 [] - No session file found: /tmp/staged/pickled_main_session.

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix UnsupportedOperationException when create edge in StreamGraph by use ForwardPartitioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - change the StreamGraph#createActualEdge logic to ensure the parallelism of upstream and downstream operators can not be consistent when ForwardForConsecutiveHashPartitioner(which is a subclass of ForwardPartitioner) used.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers:no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not documented\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-28T04:18:40Z","updated_at":"2024-07-23T04:07:29Z","closed_at":"2023-01-29T08:04:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f099a2a053f75ff5b55be2028a0359665fb87cc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bb1ac740e381244306ebca389f1011e63b91f531","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:FLINK-30808","ref":"FLINK-30808","sha":"bb1ac740e381244306ebca389f1011e63b91f531","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\ndocumentation fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdd missing val keyword\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-26T13:25:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T00:15:24Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d279a74609330161abbe87b0a91c098ce7c24fa9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21760/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21760/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21760/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/03e4e171a576de743ae8ccec2975235327fb4622","head":{"label":"novakov-alexey:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"03e4e171a576de743ae8ccec2975235327fb4622","user":{"login":"novakov-alexey","id":117519424,"node_id":"U_kgDOBwE0QA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117519424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey","html_url":"https://github.com/novakov-alexey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":564255404,"node_id":"R_kgDOIaHarA","name":"flink","full_name":"novakov-alexey/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"novakov-alexey","id":117519424,"node_id":"U_kgDOBwE0QA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/117519424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey","html_url":"https://github.com/novakov-alexey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/novakov-alexey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/novakov-alexey/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemoval of Calcite's `RexSimplify` from Flink code shows that `SearchOperatorGen` does not satisfy cases like\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM NullTable3 AS T\r\nWHERE T.a = 1 OR T.a = 3 OR T.a IS NULL\r\n```\r\nit just filters out `null` values as well.\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes that behavior and removes `RexSimplify`\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Remove `RexSimplify`\r\n  - Add check for `null` in case of `RexUnknown.nullAs == TRUE`\r\n  - Apply corresponding Calcite's Search optimizations to plans\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Supports the SQL Client gateway mode to allow the SQL Client connects to the SQL Gateway.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add command line option -e, --e*\r\n  - *Refactor SQL Client to allow gateway mode*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdd tests in the `SqlClientTest` to make sure print help msg correctly and `SqlGatewayE2ETest` to make sure the gateway mode can execute the statement successfully.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-24T14:36:53Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T01:24:05Z","closed_at":"2023-01-29T13:37:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"124ad01f68ae829a57462d3c3a3eb1281e5517b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21752/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21752/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21752/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2acaea301a6d7698fabe554ea8210708357d77bd","head":{"label":"fsk119:remote-client","ref":"remote-client","sha":"2acaea301a6d7698fabe554ea8210708357d77bd","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

redundant char\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBump frocksdbjni to 6.20.3-ververica-2.0\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Bump frocksdbjni to 6.20.3-ververica-2.0\r\n  - Update NOTICE file in flink-dist\r\n \r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing RocksDB state backeend‘s tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-23T03:55:36Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T02:47:47Z","closed_at":"2023-01-28T03:32:07Z","merged_at":"2023-01-28T03:32:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1c11ad20c8f07a4e7795fc386d2069ea19936d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21747/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21747/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21747/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/184ef568b81cf4698da0010d3e5d0b51a686522d","head":{"label":"fredia:test_frocksdb","ref":"test_frocksdb","sha":"184ef568b81cf4698da0010d3e5d0b51a686522d","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMinor typo hotfix in Javadoc.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change improves the `DefaultPreferredLocationsRetriever` so that it ignores the input locations of a ConsumePartitionGroup if the corresponding ConsumerVertexGroup is too large. This helps to avoid tasks to be unevenly distributed on nodes when running batch jobs or running jobs in session/standalone mode, because the consumers in this case will tend to be placed on the same node of the input vertex.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Changed `EdgeManagerBuildUtil` to set the ConsumedPartitionGroup/ConsumerVertexGroup to its corresponding ConsumerVertexGroup/ConsumedPartitionGroup\r\n  - Changed `DefaultPreferredLocationsRetriever` to ignore the input locations of a ConsumePartitionGroup if the corresponding ConsumerVertexGroup is too large(compared to the ConsumePartitionGroup)\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit tests in EdgeManagerBuildUtilTest and DefaultPreferredLocationsRetrieverTest*\r\n  - *The change is also covered by existing tests of preferred location retriever*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

order:\r\n- === THIS PR === FLINK-30765\r\n- https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/22379\r\n- https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/22422\r\n- https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/22380\r\n- https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/22384\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is about hardening the `LeaderElectionService.stop()` contract.\r\n\r\nThe current implementations of LeaderElectionService do not implement the stop() call consistently. Some (e.g. [StandaloneLeaderElectionService](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/c6997c97c575d334679915c328792b8a3067cfb5/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/leaderelection/StandaloneLeaderElectionService.java#L53) call revoke on the LeaderContender) whereas others don't (e.g. [DefaultLeaderElectionService](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/6e1caa390882996bf2d602951b54e4bb2d9c90dc/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/leaderelection/DefaultLeaderElectionService.java#L96)). The [MultipleComponentLeaderElectionService](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/0290715a57b8d243586ab747b0cd2416c8081012/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/leaderelection/DefaultMultipleComponentLeaderElectionService.java#L166) does call revoke on the LeaderContender instances, though.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the contract of the `LeaderElectionService.stop` call more consistent, i.e. aligning it more with what's happening if the leadership is revoked by the HA backend. The contract change reduces the assumptions that are made by the `LeaderElectionService` implementations (e.g. that the `LeaderContender` owns the `LeaderElectionService` and is, therefore, responsible for its lifecycle) which losens the coupling between the two components.\r\n\r\nThis should reduce noise when going ahead with refactoring the interfaces ([FLIP-285](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-285%3A+Refactoring+LeaderElection+to+make+Flink+support+multi-component+leader+election+out-of-the-box)).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Updated the JavaDoc in `LeaderElectionService.stop()` to specify the contract\r\n* Add revoke call to `LeaderElectionService.stop()` implementations for the case where the individual instance still have the leadership acquired\r\n* Additionally, a hotfix commit was added to remove obsolete log code (if statements)\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe `LeaderContender.revokeLeadership()` call was also added to `TestingLeaderElectionService` to make each test rely on this contract.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe entire purpose of this wrapper `DispatcherRunnerLeaderElectionLifecycleManager` is to have the start/stop of the `LeaderElectionService` out of the `DefaultDispatcherRunner`. FLINK-26522/FLIP-285 will move this logic into the `HighAvailabilityServices`. Merging both classes makes the move easier because it aligns it with the other `LeaderContender` implementations.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any reason why we need this class. There was a [brief discussion in PR #9832](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/9832#discussion_r334866031) for FLINK-11843 which introduced this change. But even there, we already discussed having a `start()` method, instead.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMoved code from `DispatcherRunnerLeaderElectionLifecycleManager` back into `DefaultDispatcherRunner`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* `DefaultDispatcherRunnerTest.testLeaderElectionStarted` was added to check the lifecycle explicitly. This test is good to check that the `LeaderElectionService` is closed as part of the `DefaultDispatcherRunner.close()` call.\r\n* Various tests within `DefaultDispatcherRunnerTest` would fail without the start method being called.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-20T12:46:19Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T12:40:31Z","closed_at":"2023-01-24T12:40:31Z","merged_at":"2023-01-24T12:40:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d1d61c68d81eba0f721b10eaf2a7246aa0814c2","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21740/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21740/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21740/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e11c556fa22e12becf7af7a01829c8459e5d5ef9","head":{"label":"XComp:FLINK-30759","ref":"FLINK-30759","sha":"e11c556fa22e12becf7af7a01829c8459e5d5ef9","user":{"login":"XComp","id":1101012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDEwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1101012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp","html_url":"https://github.com/XComp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":283817011,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODM4MTcwMTE=","name":"flink","full_name":"XComp/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XComp","id":1101012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDEwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1101012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp","html_url":"https://github.com/XComp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XComp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XComp/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe @GuardedBy annotations were assigned to some public methods which are not called under the specified lock. @GuardedBy should be used by methods that are only allowed to be called within the context of the lock that is specified in the annotation.\r\n\r\nThis is a preparation task for FLINK-26522/FLIP-285 where introduce new internal methods that actually need to be properly annotated by the `@GuardedBy` annotation.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* removes the annotations in methods that are called outside of the lock\r\n\r\n## Verifying

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the state migration tests so that when cutting branch, we need only add new version and could generates the states of stale version automatically. \r\n\r\nIn general, there are two options:\r\n1. Similar to the configuration document generator, we could have a module that depends on all the modules containing migration tests and run generation with this module. \r\n2. Introduce tools to generate states, and each module config the tools separately. \r\n\r\nWe finally choose the option 2. This is because Maven have a bad support for depending on the tests classes of other modules, we could only use the `test-jar`, which do not support transitive dependency and make it hard to manage these transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\nSince previously the generating methods are written with JUnit tests, some of them are bounded with the JUnit infrastructures, like `@ClassRule`,  `@Rule`. To avoid the burden of re-written the generating methods, we have to have some minimum support for JUnit tests interfaces. \r\n\r\nExcept for the generating, during the refactoring we also make each migration tests use a dynamic version lists: `[start, FlinkVersion.last()]`, which free us from manually change the list on cutting branch for each version. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Introduce a new framework of migration tests. \r\n- Introduce tools to scan the test classes of the configured module and generating snapshots.\r\n- Refactor existing tests based on the new framework. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually verified the process of \r\n- Add version 1.18 to `FlinkVersion`.\r\n- Generating states automatically via `mvn clean package -Pgenerate-snapshots -Dgenerate.version=1.17 -nsu -DskipRat -Dcheckstyle.skip -Drat.ignoreErrors=true -DspotlessFiles=ineffective -Dfast -DskipTests`\r\n- Run the existing tests and verified the tests including the ones against 1.17 are all executed successfully. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n

unstable `TaskManagerWideRocksDbMemorySharingITCase` by using standard deviation of memory usage\r\ninstead of `max-min` of each iteration.\r\n\r\n`TaskManagerWideRocksDbMemorySharingITCase` uses RocksDB metrics per task to verify that they are actually using the same underlying RocksDB shared resources (block cache and write buffer manager):\r\ndespite of (intentionally) varying speed of state size change, the metrics should report the same.\r\n\r\nHowever, metric collection isn't synchronous across tasks, and also doesn't guarantee cross-thread visibility (for performance reasons). This causes the test to fail sometimes.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to fix the test by collecting standard deviation across multiple rounds (100) and then verifying that percentiles are withing the bounds (found empirically).","created_at":"2023-01-19T13:59:36Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T22:10:46Z","closed_at":"2023-01-24T22:10:41Z","merged_at":"2023-01-24T22:10:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8105bb584f8e7b6302a15c1c9270b988ff574cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21733/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/21733/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/21733/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/115ae7eecadebd969b04de27966ddb01d0ac666e","head":{"label":"rkhachatryan:f30328","ref":"f30328","sha":"115ae7eecadebd969b04de27966ddb01d0ac666e","user":{"login":"rkhachatryan","id":3939322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzkzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3939322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan","html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222429887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI0Mjk4ODc=","name":"flink","full_name":"rkhachatryan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rkhachatryan","id":3939322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzkzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3939322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan","html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan/flink","description":"Apache
