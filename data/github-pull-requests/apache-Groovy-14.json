By storing modifiers in a map keyed\r\nby short class name there is a possibility for the wrong\r\nmodifiers to be stored.\r\n\r\nSince generated class files for inner classes contain an INNERCLASS\r\nself reference, the logic can be simplified to look for a matching\r\nname and storing those access modifiers. This eliminates the need\r\nto search the outer class for the INNERCLASS reference.","created_at":"2018-06-09T00:28:17Z","updated_at":"2018-06-18T04:15:52Z","closed_at":"2018-06-15T02:22:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5490d1e40ef8e79ee7737b3574b3d7e512f35d48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/753/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/753/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/753/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/bdb2ee55a15cd2844b391d9b90a5c62d5e02411d","head":{"label":"jwagenleitner:8632-decompiled-cn-nested-classes","ref":"8632-decompiled-cn-nested-classes","sha":"bdb2ee55a15cd2844b391d9b90a5c62d5e02411d","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36817367,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjgxNzM2Nw==","name":"groovy","full_name":"jwagenleitner/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner/groovy","description":"Mirror
