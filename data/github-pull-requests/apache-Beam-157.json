Summary\r\nThis PR is mainly preventing `BundleBasedDirectRunner` evaluates single side_input more than once.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, this PR changes the logic to get side_input views in `ConsumerTrackingPipelineVisitor`, and modify the unit tests to make sure that when one single side_input is used in two different PTransforms, it will be evaluated once.\r\n\r\n## Check List\r\nThank

Exposed source data capture (implemented by background caching job) control APIs in \r\n    interactive_beam module.\r\n2. Abstract background caching job into a standalone class where\r\n   pipeline jobs and limit checkers are self-contained.\r\n3. Added test_stream_service related control and tracking inside\r\n   background_caching_job and interactive_environment.\r\n4. TODO items: 1) integrate streaming_cache once it implements\r\n   cache_manager; 2) add implementation of `capture_size` control, now\r\n   the capture size limit checker is simply a thread ends whenever the\r\n   capture elapse limit checker terminates the infinitely running background\r\n   caching job; 3) wire test_stream_service's creation when the dependencies are ready.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

was using `numpy.random.RandomState` during generation of Synthetic input, which, starting from NumPy 1.17, is considered as a legacy generator. This caused the slowdown on Python 3. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the regression.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nThe following snippet was used for measuring performance:\r\n```\r\nfrom timeit import Timer\r\n\r\nt = Timer(\"pardo_test.ParDoTest().run()\",\r\n'''\r\nfrom apache_beam.testing.load_tests import pardo_test\r\nimport sys\r\nsys.argv.append('--test-pipeline-options=--input_options=\\\\'{\"num_records\": 200000, \"value_size\": 9, \"key_size\": 1}\\\\'')\r\n''')\r\nprint(min(t.repeat(number=1)))\r\n```\r\n### Results\r\nBefore:\r\n**Python 2.7** \r\n4.52470111847\r\n**Python 3.7** \r\n46.89912317299999\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n**Python 2.7** \r\n6.37386107445\r\n**Python 3.7** \r\n5.6981477510000005\r\n\r\n### Why not numpy?\r\n\r\nIt turns out that `numpy.random.bytes()` is a bit slower on Python 3:\r\n\r\n**Python 2.7**\r\n`python -m timeit -s 'import numpy as np' 'for i in xrange(20000): np.random.seed(i); np.random.bytes(90)'`\r\n10 loops, best of 3: 57.5 msec per loop\r\n\r\n**Python 3.7**\r\n`python -m timeit -s 'import numpy as np' 'for i in range(20000): np.random.seed(i); np.random.bytes(90)'`\r\n1 loop, best of 5: 414 msec per loop\r\n\r\nI've achieved better results after switching to `random` standard module. Unfortunately, the performance on Python 2 got a bit worse.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This changes the \"add_output\" interface to require a PCollection tag\r\nwhen adding an output to a PTransform.\r\n* This also changes the replacement algorithm's to propogate the\r\nPCollection tag when doing replacements.\r\n* PCollections will now have their tags correctly propagated through the Pipeline. Users may expect the old implementation which gave PCollection output ids a monotonically increasing id. To go back to the old implementation, use the \"force_generated_pcollection_output_ids\" experiment. The default is the new implementation (force_generated_pcollection_output_ids=False).\r\n\r\nChange-Id: Ibd80b0d25cd8cc5ff5c28e127f7313638e6664da\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

our larger streaming pipelines, we generally observe a short blip (1-3 minutes) in event processing, as well as an increase in lag following window closing.  One reason for this is the state cleanup timers all firing once a window closes.\r\n\r\nWe've been running this PR in our dev environment for a few days now, and the results are impressive.  By decorrelating (jittering) the state cleanup timer, we spread the timer load across a short period of time, with the trade-off of holding state for a slightly longer period of time.  In practice though, I've actually noticed our state cleans up QUICKER with this change, because the timers don't all compete with each other.\r\n\r\nI'd like to contribute this back (and could modify the core StatefulDoFn runner as well) if we agree this is something useful.\r\n\r\nThere's a couple points for discussion:\r\n- I chose 3 minutes arbitrarily based on some experimentation, should this be configurable somehow?\r\n- I use the \"user\" key (from their KV input) to derive a consistent jitter amount.  The only real reason for this is to prevent the timer from moving around each element (if we used just a random amount each time instead).  I'm not sure if this actually matters in practice, since timers are supposed to be cheap to reset?\r\n- ~~I added a counter which has been useful for debugging (and seeing how many keys are active each window), but could be removed.~~ (I removed this since it broke a bunch of unit tests)\r\n\r\nInterested to hear thoughts here.  \r\n\r\nHere's a before and after of our pubsub latency:\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1882981/74457778-bb9cf080-4e56-11ea-900c-69f2a4a28613.png)\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1882981/74457812-c788b280-4e56-11ea-801e-a4b69a84a10b.png)\r\n\r\nBased on the counter I added, we're firing ~20 million timers, across 50 workers = ~400,000 timers / worker.  So rather than having them all fire in one shot, we can spread them over 3 minutes, for only ~2,000 timers / sec, which is much more reasonable.\r\n\r\ncc @lukecwik @pabloem \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR corrects a few problems that have occurred over the past few weeks:\r\n\r\n-  bad annotations added in PRs\r\n- mangling of type ignore comments by yapf  (fixed up the issues and added an option to the config to prevent it in the future)\r\n\r\nPlus it adds some more type annotations.  Nothing too radical or dangerous here. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
