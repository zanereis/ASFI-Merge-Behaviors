to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-26T00:27:06Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T12:18:11Z","closed_at":"2024-07-29T02:53:14Z","merged_at":"2024-07-29T02:53:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a1e479bacc4936ab1be9fdd3bb88e912be5bfd2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14472/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14472/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14472/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c2dc9593133072e7b38d60a1a086b3ab7665885e","head":{"label":"oxsean:rest-exception-refine","ref":"rest-exception-refine","sha":"c2dc9593133072e7b38d60a1a086b3ab7665885e","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-25T15:07:49Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T12:18:02Z","closed_at":"2024-07-29T02:54:04Z","merged_at":"2024-07-29T02:54:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"e2865655971690d6c0a74da9b5d8c3e9336ecca5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f62f3972232073a28961296e5e017ab514a4c56e","head":{"label":"oxsean:generic-param-support","ref":"generic-param-support","sha":"f62f3972232073a28961296e5e017ab514a4c56e","user":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":703603896,"node_id":"R_kgDOKfAkuA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"oxsean/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"oxsean","id":716461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/716461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean","html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oxsean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/oxsean/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

which support many new features.</p>\n<p>The most mainly feature is Nacos support maintainer to initialize the admin user <code>nacos</code> password instead of using default password to improve the default security for deploy nacos clusters.</p>\n<p>One more thing is default disabled derby ops API to prevent false alarms regarding corresponding risks for users without authentication enabled when deploying in standalone mode. If maintainers want use this API to maintain and query data in derby, maintainers can use <code>nacos.config.derby.ops.enabled=true</code> to open this API.</p>\n<p>And other mainly features are support TLS Grpc communication between Nacos cluster nodes as an optional feature to improve Nacos security, which means nacos not only support TLS communication between client and server; What's more, Nacos start to support user extend <code>Selector</code> before callback <code>Subscriber</code> for naming module, not only can select instance of services by healthy and clusters. And Nacos client support callback service diffs by new event to reduce <code>Subscriber</code> cache and compare logics.</p>\n<p>Third mainly features are support some configs usages in Nacos console and support more enhancement usage for plugins, such as support add all metadata to prometheus sd protocol and support aliyun ram v4 signature.</p>\n<p>In addition to substantial feature updates, this version also fixes some bugs from previous versions and upgrades certain dependencies with security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Detail see:</p>\n<h2>Feature</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/10374\">#10374</a> Support naming custom selectors and support service diff events.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11456\">#11456</a> Support TLS Grpc communication between Nacos cluster nodes.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11847\">#11847</a> Nacos console support publish config with cas.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11943\">#11943</a> Record users for import configs.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11957\">#11957</a> Remove default password for user <code>nacos</code>.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12130\">#12130</a> Add metadata as labels in prometheus http sd.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12162\">#12162</a> Support aliyun ram v4 signature method.</p>\n<h2>Enhancement&amp;Refactor</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11956\">#11956</a> Refactor nacos client logging module, use SPI load current logger adapter.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12013\">#12013</a> Enhance to fast config Nacos memory setting in startup.sh by environment CUSTOM_NACOS_MEMORY.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12072\">#12072</a> Support does not impose any limit when totalCountLimit is less than 0.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12166\">#12166</a> Enhance nacos client init properties logger.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12177\">#12177</a> Update console header link to new nacos.io.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12178\">#12178</a> Add total record count display in pagination.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12185\">#12185</a> Use nacos properties in CacheDirUtil.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12221\">#12221</a> Remove the accessToken from the URL.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12235\">#12235</a> Enhance logging format in the ResponseExceptionHandler.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12246\">#12246</a> Internationalize the display of total counts in the configuration list and service list.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12321\">#12321</a> Enhance log for unexpected exception from NetworkInterface.ifUp.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12355\">#12355</a> Record the cost of ConfigDump in Prometheus.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12372\">#12372</a> Disable derby ops api default.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12382\">#12382</a> Support ram info switch.</p>\n<h2>BugFix</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/10639\">#10639</a> Fix the <code>encrypted_data_key</code> is text type so that old version can't upgrade directly.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11902\">#11902</a> Fix leak of request and response for java native runtime for nacos-client.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11926\">#11926</a> Fix Nacos can't triggle self protection when disk full in some OS.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11951\">#11951</a> Fix the problem that the serviceName and groupName are not resolved correctly when deleting an empty service instance.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11967\">#11967</a> Fix Config can't publish and listen when dataId contains some special words in Window OS.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/11968\">#11968</a> Fix Multiple config change plugin implementation configuration conflicts problem.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12022\">#12022</a> Fix nacos datasource plugin ClassCastException problem.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12046\">#12046</a> Fix cipher-aes config encrypt plugin not effect when publish config again.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alibaba/nacos/issues/12060\">#12060</a> Fix too large ttl when auth disabled.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-22T04:03:05Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T13:27:29Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f27628b7132f17ffa553bba1bbbc3c842502bbcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/718e24ca646cb22dc81160e60cd83d5e2e6e0805","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-retry-extension","ref":"3.2-retry-extension","sha":"718e24ca646cb22dc81160e60cd83d5e2e6e0805","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-21T08:06:22Z","updated_at":"2024-10-18T10:02:12Z","closed_at":"2024-07-23T02:05:10Z","merged_at":"2024-07-23T02:05:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"a93624e8cfb43991fca670cf9ad25197df331758","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14456/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14456/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14456/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/94be54b8b0471eeb161556383e3cbd8fa711944f","head":{"label":"wcy666103:condition_route_v3.1","ref":"condition_route_v3.1","sha":"94be54b8b0471eeb161556383e3cbd8fa711944f","user":{"login":"wcy666103","id":56506697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA2Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56506697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103","html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":780361800,"node_id":"R_kgDOLoNgSA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wcy666103/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wcy666103","id":56506697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA2Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56506697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103","html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nLoad Bootstrap configuration files to achieve automation of all configurations and certificate rotation.\r\nAttempt to obtain configuration from the following location\r\n1. Default location:/etc/istio/proxy/grpc-bottraph.json\r\n2. Environment variable: GRPC_XDs_BOOTSTRAP\r\n\r\nIf data cannot be read from the above location, try obtaining the bootstrap. json file from the Dubbo control panel or from the user specified URL.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. Modify the bootstrap module and add the DubboBootstrapperImpl class\r\n2. Add a credentials module to provide channel credentials during the bootstrap phase (the original code only returned null when obtaining credentials)\r\n4. Add Test: DubboBootstrapperImplTest\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Fix #14429.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nAs declared, ShutdownHook should perform process-exit ops, familiar with dubbo engine. Move ```DubboShutdownHook#addShutdownHook``` back to ```DubboBootstrap```.\r\n\r\nUpdate DubboShutdownHookTest to add more internal check and improve code coverage.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-15T06:48:00Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T03:37:45Z","closed_at":"2024-09-27T03:37:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1df2ef3896a7d1b117af55dde47d9e84830c64c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14432/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14432/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14432/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/291a4e6d292ddeb0184fd4011cb8a6066b2d917c","head":{"label":"Chenjp:3.2-fix-14429-shutdownHook","ref":"3.2-fix-14429-shutdownHook","sha":"291a4e6d292ddeb0184fd4011cb8a6066b2d917c","user":{"login":"Chenjp","id":3371180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzExODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3371180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp","html_url":"https://github.com/Chenjp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":785001058,"node_id":"R_kgDOLsoqYg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Chenjp/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Chenjp","id":3371180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzExODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3371180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp","html_url":"https://github.com/Chenjp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chenjp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Chenjp/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-11T10:02:45Z","updated_at":"2024-07-16T09:43:16Z","closed_at":"2024-07-16T09:43:16Z","merged_at":"2024-07-16T09:43:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"342121ccc2cc49a0338f9d6ad944db5cb85d2958","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14421/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14421/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14421/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b5bd438638fb537dc93a8a13704252833a4ccf0f","head":{"label":"QingJuBaiTang:bugfix/null-protocol-refresh-invoker-fail","ref":"bugfix/null-protocol-refresh-invoker-fail","sha":"b5bd438638fb537dc93a8a13704252833a4ccf0f","user":{"login":"QingJuBaiTang","id":6140615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDA2MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6140615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang","html_url":"https://github.com/QingJuBaiTang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":827243436,"node_id":"R_kgDOMU67rA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"QingJuBaiTang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"QingJuBaiTang","id":6140615,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDA2MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6140615?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang","html_url":"https://github.com/QingJuBaiTang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QingJuBaiTang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/QingJuBaiTang/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild dubbo-compiler as a fat jar could support gradle `protobuf-gradle-plugin` run the `dubbo-complier` as protoc plugin correctly.\r\nBTW, Alternatively, user could build fat jar individually to do the trick also, since the plugin can use the jar path directly ， either config all the necessary stuff to classpath.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   dubbo { \r\n           path = '/paths/dubbo-grpc-gradle-test/fat-dubbo-compiler-3.2.14.jar'\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nfix #13679 \r\n\r\nLimitation:\r\n- Since the `protobuf-gradle-plugin` doesn't support  specify the

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

[x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-07T04:05:25Z","updated_at":"2024-10-26T02:32:26Z","closed_at":"2024-07-09T13:01:02Z","merged_at":"2024-07-09T13:01:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"6e6b24498033804cfef40d52a6d9cf43ed6ac114","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14397/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14397/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14397/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/200c5ddc0d17fe96c0dc14a49f2209298a9b4384","head":{"label":"wcy666103:add_ser_constants","ref":"add_ser_constants","sha":"200c5ddc0d17fe96c0dc14a49f2209298a9b4384","user":{"login":"wcy666103","id":56506697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA2Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56506697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103","html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":780361800,"node_id":"R_kgDOLoNgSA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wcy666103/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wcy666103","id":56506697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA2Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56506697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103","html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-07T02:36:42Z","updated_at":"2024-07-08T05:10:36Z","closed_at":"2024-07-08T05:10:36Z","merged_at":"2024-07-08T05:10:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"ccfd9e6a6cbcee864a6ea74565c9d7e3e6e85398","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14396/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14396/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14396/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/31446e1edea9617b8dcf9dd9b7524e0c730f3945","head":{"label":"wcy666103:fix_package","ref":"fix_package","sha":"31446e1edea9617b8dcf9dd9b7524e0c730f3945","user":{"login":"wcy666103","id":56506697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA2Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56506697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103","html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":780361800,"node_id":"R_kgDOLoNgSA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wcy666103/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wcy666103","id":56506697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA2Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56506697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103","html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

`grpc.version` from 1.64.0 to 1.65.0.\nUpdates `io.grpc:grpc-core` from 1.64.0 to 1.65.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.65.0</h2>\n<p>grpc-netty in this release is compatible with Netty 4.1.111; it fixes the incompatibility that caused data corruption. grpc-netty-shaded is still using Netty 4.1.100.</p>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New module grpc-gcp-csm-observability (df8cfe9dd)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api: Add <code>ClientStreamTracer.inboundHeaders(Metadata)</code> (960012d76). This is the same as the existing <code>inboundHeaders()</code>, but is provided the Metadata</li>\n<li>api: Fix various typos in the documentation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11144\">#11144</a>) (6ec744f2a)</li>\n<li>core: When queuing RPCs, don’t request picks from the LB twice (8844cf7b8). This could be viewed as a small performance optimization, but mainly reduces the amount of race-handling code</li>\n<li>util: Improve AdvancedTlsX509KeyManager’s documentation, verification, and testing. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11139\">#11139</a>) (781b4c457) This change shows <code>@ExperimentalApi</code> being removed, but it was re-added in 3c97245 before the release</li>\n<li>examples: Fix broken command in reflection readme (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11131\">#11131</a>) (c31dbf48a)</li>\n<li>binder: Add a connection timeout (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11255\">#11255</a>) (791f894e2)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: Exit idle mode when delayed transport is in use (fea577c80). This was a long-standing race that could cause RPCs to hang, but was very unlikely to be hit. Avoiding the double-picking (8844cf7b8) made the race more visible</li>\n<li>netty: Fix Netty composite buffer merging to be compatible with Netty 4.1.111 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/11294\">#11294</a>) (0fea7dd). The previous behavior easily caused data corruption</li>\n<li>okhttp: Workaround SSLSocket not noticing socket is closed (a28357e19).

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-21T10:46:00Z","updated_at":"2024-06-25T06:33:20Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/983ac31f8bf35b6bb14047ead3d3ee5d20852fcb","head":{"label":"wcy666103:glcc_pu","ref":"glcc_pu","sha":"983ac31f8bf35b6bb14047ead3d3ee5d20852fcb","user":{"login":"wcy666103","id":56506697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA2Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56506697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103","html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":780361800,"node_id":"R_kgDOLoNgSA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wcy666103/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wcy666103","id":56506697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTA2Njk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56506697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103","html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wcy666103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wcy666103/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-20T01:34:09Z","updated_at":"2024-06-24T01:26:46Z","closed_at":"2024-06-24T01:26:46Z","merged_at":"2024-06-24T01:26:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d5fa50783c5321447368230ca75138425697459","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14348/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14348/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14348/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/679e989222fc98bd110b578c66728cf073488395","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0620-threadpool","ref":"0620-threadpool","sha":"679e989222fc98bd110b578c66728cf073488395","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe background is that I have a jvm and started two services. Because the two services have dependent jar packages that conflict, each service has its own class loader. Then because it is in a jvm, I want to use injvm rpc. Currently, Dubbo Core is shared, and SpringInjectExtension is isolated for each service class loader.\r\nNow I encounter a ClassCaseException\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/assets/55247691/7614ac87-4eb3-4965-bbc6-0ec2729e8655)\r\n\r\nThere is a variable named consumerServiceModel, but its type is ProviderModule\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/assets/55247691/017c5005-fb84-4244-9aa9-0366b87db6d2)\r\n\r\nI think the current Invoker is actually the consumer Thread. Then the Module in the url is the provider. If the consumer and provider class loaders are different, I understand that the classloader of the current Thread should be used directly instead of the classloader in the url.\r\nSo I commit this PR, and the code has been verified locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it).

Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-16T13:12:16Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T19:11:44Z","closed_at":"2024-06-16T13:15:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84d799e5d9601616f6e02c084fe9ef509b073a2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/caa5cdaebef0fbe5b068fd464275a73e5c508e85","head":{"label":"heliang666s:jdk-serialization","ref":"jdk-serialization","sha":"caa5cdaebef0fbe5b068fd464275a73e5c508e85","user":{"login":"heliang666s","id":147408835,"node_id":"U_kgDOCMlHww","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147408835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s","html_url":"https://github.com/heliang666s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":783569232,"node_id":"R_kgDOLrRRUA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"heliang666s/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"heliang666s","id":147408835,"node_id":"U_kgDOCMlHww","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147408835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s","html_url":"https://github.com/heliang666s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/heliang666s/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-16T12:57:13Z","updated_at":"2024-06-16T13:02:36Z","closed_at":"2024-06-16T12:57:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/14318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/14318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4a55a95f4b3d63dcb00abe05c899c46a4f45d000","head":{"label":"heliang666s:jdk","ref":"jdk","sha":"4a55a95f4b3d63dcb00abe05c899c46a4f45d000","user":{"login":"heliang666s","id":147408835,"node_id":"U_kgDOCMlHww","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147408835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s","html_url":"https://github.com/heliang666s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":783569232,"node_id":"R_kgDOLrRRUA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"heliang666s/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"heliang666s","id":147408835,"node_id":"U_kgDOCMlHww","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147408835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s","html_url":"https://github.com/heliang666s","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heliang666s/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/heliang666s/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
