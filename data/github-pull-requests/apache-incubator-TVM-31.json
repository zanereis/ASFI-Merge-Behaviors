PR introduces the static memory planning pass on binding block level, as well as an analysis function that estimate the memory usage after the memory planning pass. It supports the following features: nested-tuples,  reuse memory of the input of reshape ops, an estimator that returns total memory size needed to be allocated before and after memory planning, as well as the number of tensors / memory blocks to be allocated before and after memory planning.\r\n\r\nThe estimation is static -- it does not consider control flows (such as “if” and cross-function calls). It simply accumulates the size of every alloc_tensor and alloc_storage.\r\n\r\nWe will produce “`relax.memory.alloc_tensor/storage`” as the results produced by memory

to this PR, `python/tvm/script/__init__.py` imports both tir and relax submodules. This leads to the phenomenum that when people does\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm.script import tir as T\r\n```\r\n, the relax submodule will be implicitly visited by `__init__.py` as well.\r\n\r\nSince TIR does not rely on Relax, it is good not to import both of them at the same time. (This can prevent cyclic imports sometimes.)\r\n\r\nThis PR does this decoupling by introducing two files\r\n\r\n* `python/tvm/script/relax.py`\r\n* `python/tvm/script/tir.py`\r\n\r\nand removing the imports from `python/tvm/script/__init__.py` and `python/tvm/script/parser/__init__.py`. With this change, we force people to manually do `from tvm.script import tir` and `from tvm.script import relax` to use TVMScript parser, which is right our conventional way.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo elabore a bit more on the cyclic import:\r\n\r\nWith #14029, submodule `relax.transform` will import topi to register the legalization functions for each operators into the op registry. Module topi imports the TVMScript parser of TIR, in `python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu.py`.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the previous behavior is when importing TIR parser, the submodule `tvm.script.parser.relax` is also visited and initialized, and thereby brings the risk of cyclic import.\r\n\r\nSince the TOPI side only needs TIR parser, we don’t need to import the Relax parser. By decoupling the import of TIR and Relax in module `tvm.script` can prevent the cyclic dependency.","created_at":"2023-02-18T03:05:31Z","updated_at":"2023-02-18T04:06:52Z","closed_at":"2023-02-18T04:06:52Z","merged_at":"2023-02-18T04:06:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d250c1890738c261e16801dc9ed55d1d3ea3ac7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14033/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14033/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14033/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/44838c495ccaffadac673f32b3d7efca542f8e63","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:unity-dev/2023-02-17-script-cyclic-dependency","ref":"unity-dev/2023-02-17-script-cyclic-dependency","sha":"44838c495ccaffadac673f32b3d7efca542f8e63","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

PR is the operator legalization pass, which transforms high-level operator calls to `call_tir`s of corresponding low-level TIR PrimFuncs.\r\n\r\n* The legalization pass provides customizability, which enables people to pass in a customized legalization map to override the default legalization method.\r\n\r\n* The legalization supports symbolic shape. (At this moment only pooling does not support symbolic shape, as TOPI pooling does not support. This needs to be fixed in followup PRs.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following code shows how to use this pass:\r\n```python\r\n# Define the pass input IRModule\r\n@tvm.script.ir_module\r\nclass Module:\r\n

to this PR, though the `convert` function is capable of converting a single Python function/lambda to TVM func, it is not able to convert a container whose values inside are functions to TVM

mismatch between the blocks present in the `result` vs the blocks passed in `block_sref_to_reuse` caused the bug mentioned in #13974. \r\n\r\nThis patch tries to fix that bug by collecting only the blocks that are part of result and also present in the block replacement map `new_block_to_old_`. Since the scope block is `result`, only that block and its child blocks would be replaced, and any replaced block would be present in `rewriter.new_block_to_old_`. Thus, collecting the replaced blocks from among child blocks of `result` guarantees that the `block_sref_reuse` would contain all the replaced blocks and that they'll point to the correct block in `result` thus avoiding the missing SRef

there, the change want to enforce the power and flexiblity of `CompactBufferAllocation` pass in two aspects:\r\n1. Free of pass order\r\n    - It could work on both s-tir (with opaque blocks) and lowered tir. For example, now one could be able to invoke `LoopPartition` and then make partitioned tile aware buffer compactions.\r\n    - We test existing cases to ensure that \r\n      `(LowerOpaqueBlock . CompactBufferAllocation) (mod) == (CompactBufferAllocation . LowerOpaqueBlock) (mod)` \r\n\r\n2. Allow \"non-strict\" compaction\r\n    - Add an option `is_strict` defaults to `True`, to denote that during compaction we should respect the original buffer shape bound. Thus the compacted buffer region never exceed the original.\r\n    - If set to `False`, the \"compacted\" shape is totally determined to cover buffer region accesses. Thus it may become larger than the original shape. This change the original semantic for out-of-bound accesses but may be helpful in certain usages. \r\n    - If loop domain changed (eg, align the loop dim or remove the extra predicate), the accessed buffer region may grow, the pass could provide a fallback implementation to adapt the buffer regions.\r\n\r\nAbout implementation issues:\r\n- To achieve [1]\r\n    -  Buffer decl point:\r\n        -  (s-tir) `T.alloc_buffer` in block form is handled without any change.\r\n        -  (lowered) `T.decl_buffer` is newly handled. We assume it is at the proper position to dominate all accesses.\r\n    -  Predicates\r\n        - Predicates in `T.where` and `IfThenElse`, `T.if_then_else` are handled uniformlly now. We would try simply resolve the predicate to update loop domain as before. But on failures, now we keep them into pending stack.\r\n        - The visit logic is very alike `IRVisitorWithAnalyzer`'s, but since  `arith::Analyzer` and `arith::IntSet` are independent components now, the change do not introduce `IRVisitorWithAnalyzer`'.\r\n    - Buffer accesses\r\n        - There is no difference between s-tir and lowered form. If there are pending predicates on access point, always try affine iter analysis to get more tight relaxed region.\r\n    - Thread binding\r\n        - To work on lowered form, `attr::thread_extent` and `attr::virtual_thread` are handled to record neccesary info for thread relaxion.\r\n    - Buffer aliasing \r\n        - No change to `T.match_buffer` handling, and we explicitly disable compaction to alised buffers in lowered form.\r\n    - Dim alignment\r\n        - We utilize annotation field in `T.allocate` and preserve `attr::buffer_dim_align` in `LowerOpaqueBlock` pass when it convert `T.alloc_buffer` to `T.allocate`. Thus the compaction could collect the dim alignment information in lowered form.\r\n\r\n- To achieve [2]\r\n    - It is much direct. `SimplifyAndNarrowBufferRegionFromNDIntSet` would not intersect accessed region with original shape if the `is_strict` option is overrided to

PR adds support of \"compiled\" mode to the VM. The compiled mode translate the relax function into TIR function and drive it through the TIR function.\r\n\r\nIt is different from the micro AOT codegen, which generate TIR code that targets the micro C runtime environment and useful for resource limited settings with smaller set of features. Both leverages the low-level TIR build that is also shared with TensorIR.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation targets full TVM (VM) runtime, that comes with PackedFunc, object, tuple, closure and all kinds of rich structure support. This also mean that we can leverage the full runtime support to handle things like allocation, dynamic shape, easy plugins and python interaction, which are not available in more limited runtime.\r\n\r\nThe user directly use the same API to load the generated code regardless of compiled mode or bytecode. And just need to change one line\r\n\r\n```python\r\nex = relax.vm.build(mod, target, exec_mode=\"compiled\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe simplicity is thanks to the TVM runtime archiecture that allows us to compose things together in objects. The only difference is how the PackedFunc of high-level driving is being provided. In the case of bytecode it is normal interpretation and in the case of compiled mode it is TIR.\r\n\r\nIt is a complete implementation Unit-testcases are added.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces async pipeline in the current TVM's MultiLevelTiling Rules. This PR is based on apache/tvm#13966, which is already merged. This is because some conv2d workload will use `tir.if_then_else` to pad the input to the correct size, and this PR uses async copy in such copy statement.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. Add a subrule in `src/meta_schedule/schedule_rule/multi_level_tiling.h/.cc` that annotate async copy for mlt in supported arch (>= sm80).\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nIn CUDA Core, this PR has a perf boost of around 1T GFLOP/s in most Conv2d test cases and 1T ~ 2T in most GEMM test cases.\r\n\r\nAll generated codes, scripts, and traces are available at

changes to the compute, various bugfixes and improvements to the corresponding NHWC schedule:\r\n\r\n* There is currently a block that is not run as a part of tuning trials, but gets run during compilation with tuning logs. Since a lot of unrolling and vectorization happens there, for some conv2d operators the extra vectorizing and unrolling results in about 18x size increase in asm and can take around 10 minutes per operator to compile. That essentially makes whole networks uncompilable, so remove that block.\r\n* There is no fallback config or NHWC logs in the TopHub. So add a fallback config. This significantly reduces the no tuning compile time, e.g. by about 10x for mobilenet.\r\n* The order of axis we passed to reorder_config was different to the order that was used to define the reorder. By looking at the compute definition and based on tuning results of whole networks, it seems to be a bug.\r\n* Constrain potential unrolling to OWI and OCI axis as unrolling across OHI results in uncompilably huge code size. This change reduces the number of unsuccessful tuning trials from about 50% to about 20%.\r\n* Other minor tweaks.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-15T17:20:45Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T15:42:30Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T09:04:33Z","merged_at":"2023-02-22T09:04:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"fbd641c92b11fd059922144f81d078a888b56058","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14003/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14003/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14003/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5a0ec43a3a39ecb7e99ff10e1bebb2c95e99d01f","head":{"label":"ekalda:nhwc-schedule-fix","ref":"nhwc-schedule-fix","sha":"5a0ec43a3a39ecb7e99ff10e1bebb2c95e99d01f","user":{"login":"ekalda","id":15799086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15799086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":215831751,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTU4MzE3NTE=","name":"tvm","full_name":"ekalda/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ekalda","id":15799086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk5MDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15799086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda","html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekalda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ekalda/tvm","description":"Open

PR introduce NestedMsg to robustly handle nested-tuple analysis.\r\n\r\nRelax support nested tuple structures in the IR.\r\nNested tuple structure is important to support advanced groupings in cases such as gradient calculation and other scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe possible presence of nested tuple does mean that we need to to robustly handle analysis that contains nested tuple structures in a dataflow

We also introduces various helper functions to compose and decompose

PR introduces the high-level tensor computation operators in Relax. The operators are categorized into the following kinds:\r\n* unary, for operators with single tensor input, mainly arithmatic computations,\r\n* binary, for operators with two inputs, mainly arithmatic or comparison computations,\r\n* ternary, for operators with three inputs,\r\n* creation, for operators that create a tensor,\r\n* datatype, for operators that focus on datatype,\r\n* indexing, for operators that index a tensor,\r\n* linear algebra,\r\n* manipulation, for operators that manipulates a tensor, in the form of reshape, permute dims, etc.,\r\n* search, for operators that do searching,\r\n* set, for operators that work on sets,\r\n* statistical, for operators on compute statistic\r\n* neural network,\r\n* image.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Siyuan Feng

there are two equivalent ways of declaring a buffer in TVMScript:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbuffer = T.buffer_decl(...)\r\nbuffer = T.Buffer(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe two approaches are aliases to each other and are essentially the same in implementation. Therefore, this PR encourages to use `T.Buffer` as the recommended approach as it's a bit shorter. Meanwhile, `T.buffer_decl` will continue to be valid in TVMScript, but a deprecation warning will be emitted if its

PR introduces a small tweak to TVMScript printer that simplifies\r\nvariable definition in TIR.\r\n\r\nOrigionally, defining a TIR var uses `T.var(dtype)`, e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\r\na = T.var(\"int32\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR encourages to shorten the definition to:\r\n\r\n```python\r\na = T.int32()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no breaking change in this PR, which means the legacy behavior\r\nstill works without any

A Relay Expr mutator to fuse the ops\r\n\r\nThis PR separates the graph partitioning code from `fuse_ops.cc` and moves it to the analysis folder, for:\r\n1. Better code organization and readability as the graph partitioning code is quite long and not directly related to the fusion mutator\r\n2. Possible reuse opportunities for other fusion passes in Relax\r\n\r\nNOTE: we won't bring relax fusion in `main` branch for now, but this pr is still reasonable for `main`.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen

PR fixes the timeout rule of MetaSchedule RPCRunner.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the RPCRunner sets a timeout threshold for jobs submitted to popen pool. As a result, the jobs are timed since the time that they are sent to the remote side.\r\n\r\nConsider the case where there is only a single device for measurement. In this case, all jobs can only be executed serially and jobs must queue up. Therefore, the previous timeout configuration means the time spent on queueing will also be counted. This causes some jobs, in the worst cases, gets timeout without even started to execute, and has negative impacts on RPC MetaSchedule tuning, from the perspectives of both efficiency and result performance.\r\n\r\nTo address the problem, this PR\r\n* removes the RPCRunner timeout requirement for PopenExecutor. Since now, the RPCRunner timeout will only be raised from the RPC server side.\r\n* changes the default maximum number of RPCRunner workers to 1, which is to avoid the case where too many jobs waiting in line.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Bohan Hou

`ScheduleTransformLayout` is called, the block corresponding to the BlockRV named `block` is potentially changed.

results in crash as unknown type_index_\r\n\r\nThis PR is a temporary fix and a permanent fix would probably need to identify that the BlockRV is not pointing to a valid sref and throw a proper error

commit adds a utility function `tir::IdentifyMemCpy`, which analyzes a `tir::For` loop and determines whether it is equivalent to a memcpy.

(e.g. Identifying an entire TIR function as equivalent to memcpy would allow calls to that TIR function to be removed from end-to-end

PR introduces a decorator `tvm.ir.base.deprecated`, which emits a\r\ndeprecation warning if an outdated API is used, but preserves backward\r\ncompatibility by still allowing the API to be used.\r\n\r\nFor example, currently the preferred way of TIR buffer declaration in\r\nfunction signature is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef example(\r\n  A: T.Buffer(...),  # legacy behavior is `T.Buffer[...]`\r\n): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this decorator, if a user writes `T.Buffer[...]`, the parser will\r\nstill function properly, but emits a warning that guides the user to\r\nadopt `T.Buffer(...)` if possible.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no breaking change at all in this PR, we believe this\r\nis useful to help users upgrade before any breaking change eventually\r\ntakes

`floormod(x,2)` has only two possible values, it can be simplified more aggressively than most FloorMod expressions.  The additional simplifications are derived from `floormod(x,2) + floormod(x+1,2) == 1`, which is true for denominator `2`, along with the usual `floordiv(x,2)*2 + floormod(x,2) == x`, which is true for all denominators.\r\n\r\nThis initially arose from an index expression `floormod(x + 1, 2) * 8192`, for `x ∈ [0, 2)`.  This commit allows the expression to be re-written as `x * (-8192) + 8192` and recognized as a strided

several related rewrite rules will have identical output patterns and preconditions, differing only by the form of the input pattern.  For example, both `(x + y) - y` and `(y + x) - y` can be simplified to `x`.  Previously, these would be written as separate rewrite rules, which required duplicating the output and preconditions.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces `PMatchesOneOf`, which attempts a series of pattern matches, stopping after the first successful match.  The `PMatchesOneOf` instance can be used as the input pattern for rewrite rules.  A helper function `matches_one_of` is also added, which returns an instance of `PMatchesOneOf`.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n// Before\r\nTVM_TRY_REWRITE( (x + y) - y, x);\r\nTVM_TRY_REWRITE( (y + x) - y,
