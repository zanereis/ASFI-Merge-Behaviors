PR aims to illustrate how to seamlessly use Beam for data preprocessing in a larger ML workflow:\r\n- It adds an entry to the website that explains the Beam DAG and how it relates to the DAGs constructed by orchestrating frameworks (such as KFP and TFX)\r\n- It includes two toy examples of ML workflows, one that uses Beam in combination with Kubeflow Pipelines and one that uses Beam in combination with Tensorflow Extended. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a custom main wrapper around the JMH runner that supports publishing JMH benchmark results to InfluxDB.\r\n\r\n<h3>Schema</h3>\r\n\r\nThe wrapper writes an aggregated InfluxDB datapoint for each benchmark to <b>measurement</b>\r\n `{INFLUXDB_BASE_MEASUREMENT}_{mode}`. Typically this is `java_jmh_thrpt`.\r\n\r\nThe <b>timestamp</b> of the datapoint corresponds to the start time of the respective benchmark.\r\n\r\nIndividual timeseries are discriminated using the following <b>tags</b> including tags corresponding to additional benchmark parameters in case of parameterized benchmarks:\r\n\r\n- `benchmark` (string): Fully qualified name of the benchmark\r\n- `scoreUnit` (string): JMH score unit\r\n- optionally, additional parameters in case of a parameterized benchmark (string)\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe following fields are captured for each benchmark:\r\n- `score` (float): JMH score\r\n- `scoreMean` (float): Mean score of all iterations\r\n- `scoreMedian` (float): Median score of all iterations\r\n- `scoreError` (float): Mean error of the score\r\n- `sampleCount` (integer): Number of score samples\r\n- `durationMs` (integer): Total benchmark duration (including warmups)\r\n\r\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\r\nIf settings can be inferred from the environment, benchmark results will be published to\r\nInfluxDB. Otherwise this will just delegate to the default JMH Main class.\r\n\r\nUse the following environment variables to configure the publisher:\r\n- `INFLUXDB_HOST`: InfluxDB host\r\n- `INFLUXDB_DATABASE`: InfluxDB database\r\n- `INFLUXDB_USER`: InfluxDB user\r\n- `INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD`: InfluxDB user password\r\n- `INFLUXDB_BASE_MEASUREMENT`: Prefix for measurement name, the benchmark mode will be appended to this\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Setup and run Datastore emulator in background process\r\n2. Compile Cloud Functions and run them in background\r\n3. Execute CD step for samples/learning-content\r\n4. Run integration tests that call CFs via HTTP client. Compare responses with those from samples/api.\r\n5. Datastore emulator generates indexes while the queries are executed. Compare it with VCS version. We will use it in future Cloud Deployment workflow.\r\n\r\nExample workflow run:\r\nhttps://github.com/akvelon/beam/runs/8192798498\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a start to addressing #22813. @TheNeuralBit I put up a draft. Let me know if this still would be worth adding to the sdk or if there is way to do this already.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of the pipeline:\r\n```python\r\nwith TestPipeline() as p:\r\n  _ = p \\\r\n  | RunInference(...) \\\r\n  | BatchToArrowTable() \\  # turns a dict of vectors into a pa.Table,\r\n                           # e.g. {'id': [1, 2, 3], 'score': [0.9, 0.1, 0.8]} -> pa.Table     \r\n  | WriteToParquetBatched(\r\n      path, self.SCHEMA, num_shards=1, shard_name_template='')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n* Don't need to un-batch into a series of python dicts, which hurts performance.\r\n* Models naturally return batches, so it works\r\n* I didn't add it in yet, but you can infer the schema from the first batch (possibly will break something, but worked with dataflow)\r\n\r\n### Open Questions\r\n1. Controlling `row_group_size` would need to be handled upstream\r\n2. A lot of duplicate code. Possibly some smart ways to refactor a bit (let me know)\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR addresses https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23022:\r\n\r\n- Adds validations to consider [Pub/Sub Resource limits](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/quotas#resource_limits), which should be done over the entire message (payload + attributes) and not only the payload.\r\n- Fixes a scenario in which `String.length()` was not enough to verify if attribute keys/values are over the limits, because they are specified in bytes.\r\n- Adds test cases to cover existing gaps.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

second part of #19817 (keep the issue open for as go support is still pending).\r\n\r\nThis change makes decimal type work for xlang transforms (such as jdbc) in python sdk. It also contains prerequisite changes for the minimum support of a portable logical type with argument in both Java and Python sdk.\r\n\r\nPython SDK still cannot get the argument value from proto because `SchemaTranslation.value_to_runner_api` method does not exist yet (it is `SchemaTranslation.fieldValueToProto` in Java SDK). Nevertheless because the argument is just a wrapper, and the Decimal value can be recovered from the encoded data alone. This does not affect the decimal type.\r\n\r\nBecause the change is already large, value_to_runner_api and the complete support of argument values  in python is let as followup.\r\n\r\n* migrate FixedPrecisionNumeric jdbclogicaltype to portable\r\n  logical type\r\n\r\n* Support DECIMAL type in python sdk xlang jdbc transform\r\n\r\n* Support standard logical type with argument in java sdk\r\n\r\n* proto support logical type's argument type in java sdk.\r\n  Support of logical type's argument value is still pending\r\n\r\n* Implement BigIntegerCoder and DecimalCoder in python sdk\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
