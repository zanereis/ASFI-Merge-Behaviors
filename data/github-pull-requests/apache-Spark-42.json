We map both bit(1)[] and bit(n>1)[] as `ArrayType(BinaryType)`. It is exactly the opposite of Postgres' behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the mapping and makes a special getter for bit(n>1)[] values to fix both of the problems\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

Left to do/discussion topics (to be removed by the PR completion)\r\n- Handling of a lowercase (`utf8_binary_lcase`) collation type seems a bit grueling in the long run. This PR handles it the same way as in every other place, since I think it is out of the scope of this PR, but should we maybe create a work item to generalize this collation type better (if we don't have it already)?\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is created to add support for collations to StringTrim family of functions/expressions, specifically:\r\n- `StringTrim`\r\n- `StringTrimBoth`\r\n- `StringTrimLeft`\r\n- `StringTrimRight`\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- `stringExpressions.scala`\r\n  - Check input types to be of the same collation.\r\n  - Route to proper endpoints in `UTF8String` - `doEval` and `doGenCode`.\r\n- `UTF8String.java`\r\n  - Implement logic for all trim functions (logic should be well commented-out in the code and mostly matches already existing implementations of `trimLeft` and `trimRight`).\r\n\r\nOther minor changes in this PR:\r\n- Change parameter names in `CollationFactory.getStringSearch()` to a more descriptive ones.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are incrementally adding collation support to a built-in string functions in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes:\r\n- User should now be able to use non-default collations in string trim functions.\r\n- User will receive `DATATYPE_MISMATCH.COLLATION_MISMATCH` exception if collations of two function parameters do not match.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAlready existing tests + new unit/e2e tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a syntax `WITH SCHEMA EVOLUTION` to the SQL MERGE command, which allows the user to specify automatic schema evolution for a specific operation.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nMERGE WITH SCHEMA EVOLUTION\r\nINTO tgt\r\nUSING src\r\nON ...\r\nWHEN ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `WITH SCHEMA EVOLUTION` is specified, schema evolution-related features must be turned on for this single statement and only in this statement.\r\n\r\nSpark is only responsible for recognizing the existence or absence of the syntax `WITH SCHEMA EVOLUTION`, and the result is passed down to the MERGE command. Data sources must respect the syntax and give appropriate reactions: turn on features that are categorised as \"schema evolution\" when the syntax does exist. For example, when the underlying table is Delta Lake, the feature \"mergeSchema\" will be turned on (see https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/c41977db3529a3139d6306abe5ded161f070982a/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/DeltaAnalysis.scala#L538).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see the previous section.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, add `def quiet` in both `ReusedPySparkTestCase` and `ReusedConnectTestCase`;\r\n2, replace existing `QuietTest(self.sc)` with `self.quiet()`;\r\n3, remove unnecessary overridden parity tests;\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nthere are a lot of tests not enabled in parity test due to the usage of `sc` in `with QuietTest(self.sc)`, some of them were break into `def check_` and call the `check_` functions in the parity tests;\r\nHowever, there are still such tests not enabled.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `QuietTest` within parity tests and make it easier to enable the remaining tests (`def check_` no longer needed).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno, test only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nci\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use Apache Hadoop `Magic Committer` for all S3 buckets by default in Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Hadoop `Magic Committer` has been used for S3 buckets to get the best performance since [S3 became fully consistent on December 1st, 2020](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/).\r\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html#ConsistencyModel\r\n> Amazon S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUT and DELETE requests of objects in your Amazon S3 bucket in all AWS Regions. This behavior applies to both writes to new objects as well as PUT requests that overwrite existing objects and DELETE requests. In addition, read operations on Amazon S3 Select, Amazon S3 access controls lists (ACLs), Amazon S3 Object Tags, and object metadata (for example, the HEAD object) are strongly consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the migration guide is updated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe can utilize TPC-DS testing infrastructure already present in Spark. The idea is to vary TPC-DS table string columns by adding multiple collations with different ordering rules and case sensitivity, producing new tables. These tables should yield the same results against predefined TPC-DS queries for certain batches of collations. For example, when comparing query runs on table where columns are first collated as `UTF8_BINARY` and then as `UTF8_BINARY_LCASE`, we should be getting same results after converting to lowercase.\r\n\r\nIntroduce new query suite which tests the described behavior with available collations (utf8_binary and unicode) combined with case conversions (lowercase, uppercase, randomized case for fuzzy testing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImprove collations testing coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded TPC-DS collations query suite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46830\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd collation support to types of return values for calls to substr, left, right, when passed in arguments of an explicit, implicit, or session-specified collations. Add tests to validate behavior. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe are incrementally adding collation support to built-in string functions in Spark. These functions are intended to be supported for collated types. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nthese sql functions will now not throw errors when passed in collated types. Instead, they will return the right value, of the passed in type. Or of the default collation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit testing + ad-hoc spark shell and pyspark shell interactions. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAlways set `io.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nArrow requires `-Dio.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true` for JDK9+, see details in ARROW-7223. SPARK-29924 (fixed in 3.0.0) added document to guide users to add such JavaOpts manually, as Arrow is a Spark built-in component, and later we added such Java options to the building system(Maven, SBT, and PySpark test suite) manually. Now Spark requires JDK 17+, I think we can add such Java options by default to reduce disturbing users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, no impacts for those users who manually added `io.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true`, but makes life easier for new Spark users. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-03-27T03:14:26Z","updated_at":"2024-03-27T05:17:01Z","closed_at":"2024-03-27T05:16:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"00e7e9943d5fb859f7397fce1073a2bc171c6d7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45733/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45733/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45733/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6bd066d16cd4bd1ffd1bdb276681b3c2feff3741","head":{"label":"pan3793:SPARK-47610","ref":"SPARK-47610","sha":"6bd066d16cd4bd1ffd1bdb276681b3c2feff3741","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275650396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU2NTAzOTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"pan3793/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/spark","description":"Apache

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo enhance Apache Spark's logging system by implementing structured logging. This transition will change the format of the default log output from plain text to JSON lines, making it more analyzable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the default log output format will be json lines instead of plain text. User can restore the default plain text output when disabling configuration `spark.log.structuredLogging.enabled`. \r\nIf a user is a customized log4j configuration, there is no changes in the log output.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew Unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44575 added a default parameter to `HiveThriftServer2.startWithContext` API. Although this is source-compatible, this is not binary-compatible - for eg. a binary built with new code won't be able to run with the old code. In this PR, we maintain forward and backward compatibility by keeping the API same and introducing a separate API for the additional parameter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nonly developer API change\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExtend built-in string functions to support non-binary, non-lowercase collation for: substring_index.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUpdate collation support for built-in string functions in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users should now be able to use COLLATE within arguments for built-in string function SUBSTRING_INDEX in Spark SQL queries, using non-binary collations such as UNICODE_CI.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests for queries using SubstringIndex (`CollationStringExpressionsSuite.scala`).\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### To consider:\r\nThere is no check for collation match between string and delimiter, it will be introduced with Implicit Casting.\r\n\r\nWe can remove the original `public UTF8String subStringIndex(UTF8String delim, int count)` method, and get the existing behavior using `subStringIndex(delim, count, 0)`.","created_at":"2024-03-26T15:09:46Z","updated_at":"2024-04-30T09:20:47Z","closed_at":"2024-04-30T09:19:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de3bc3635d5e95d5adb4658f5270d1643e77da0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45725/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45725/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45725/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/437de716075e24b6abd54266e95dd4d3f2f747c5","head":{"label":"miland-db:miland-db/substringIndex-stringLocate","ref":"miland-db/substringIndex-stringLocate","sha":"437de716075e24b6abd54266e95dd4d3f2f747c5","user":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768539955,"node_id":"R_kgDOLc79Mw","name":"spark","full_name":"miland-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admi

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a race condition between the maintenance thread and task thread when change-log checkpointing is enabled, and ensure all snapshots are valid.\r\n\r\n1. The maintenance thread currently relies on class variable lastSnapshot to find the latest checkpoint and uploads it to DFS. This checkpoint can be modified at commit time by Task thread if a new snapshot is created.\r\n2. The task thread was not resetting the lastSnapshot at load time, which can result in newer snapshots (if a old version is loaded) being considered valid and uploaded to DFS. This results in VersionIdMismatch errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese are logical bugs which can cause `VersionIdMismatch` errors causing user to discard the snapshot and restart the query. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test cases. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44953 to refine the newly added `FAILED_READ_FILE` error. It's better to always throw `FAILED_READ_FILE` error if anything goes wrong during file reading. This is more predictable and easier for users to do error handling. This PR adds sub error classes to `FAILED_READ_FILE` so that users can know what went wrong quicker.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to add add a warning log when failed to canceling the job group.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn production, we found that when there are many jobs, if we specify `a just-submitted job group` and `cancel` it using the API `SparkContext#cancelJobGroup(groupId: String)`, the cancellation will fail (`silently`) because the job has not yet entered `activeJobs`, and there is `no warning` prompt.\r\n(PS: Due to historical reasons, we are not currently using the newer API `SparkContext#cancelJobGroupAndFutureJobs(groupId: String)`)\r\n\r\nI propose to add `a warning log` here to help troubleshoot `issues`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, only for log.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-26T11:28:52Z","updated_at":"2024-03-26T16:53:42Z","closed_at":"2024-03-26T16:53:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f42704604e4f5fe692ab52200bf68a09474c8d31","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4e90591ec96c2e17d84a1cb0d3290a4c02f81ba5","head":{"label":"panbingkun:handleJobGroupCancelled_add_log","ref":"handleJobGroupCancelled_add_log","sha":"4e90591ec96c2e17d84a1cb0d3290a4c02f81ba5","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded normalization of map keys when they are put in `ArrayBasedMapBuilder`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs map keys need to be unique, we need to add normalization on floating point numbers and prevent the following case when building a map: `Map(0.0, -0.0)`.\r\nThis further unblocks GROUP BY statement for Map Types as per [this discussion](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45549#discussion_r1537803505).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UTs in `ArrayBasedMapBuilderSuite`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe found two analyzer rule execution order issues in our internal workloads:\r\n- `CreateStruct.apply` creates `NamePlaceholder` for unresolved `NamedExpression`. However, with certain rule execution order, the `NamedExpression` may be removed (e.g. remove unnecessary `Alias`) before `NamePlaceholder` is resolved, then `NamePlaceholder` can't be resolved anymore.\r\n- UNPIVOT uses `UnresolvedAlias` to wrap `UnresolvedAttribute`. There is a conflict about how to determine the final alias name. If `ResolveAliases` runs first, then `UnresolvedAlias` will be removed and eventually the alias will be `b` for nested column `a.b`. If `ResolveReferences` runs first, then we resolve `a.b` first and then `UnresolvedAlias` will determine the alias as `a.b` not `b`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the two issues\r\n- `CreateStruct.apply` should determine the field name immediately if the input is `Alias`\r\n- The parser rule for UNPIVOT should follow how we parse SELECT and return `UnresolvedAttribute` directly without the `UnresolvedAlias` wrapper. It's a bit risky to fix the order issue between `ResolveAliases` and `ResolveReferences` as it can change the final query schema, we will save it for later.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix unstable analyzer behavior with different rule execution orders.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, some failed queries can run now. The issue for UNPIVOT only affects the error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nverified by our internal workloads. The repro query is quite complicated to trigger a certain rule execution order so we won't add tests for it. The fix is quite obvious.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr makes the following changes to allow Spark to build with `-release` instead of `-target`:\r\n\r\n1. Use `MethodHandle` instead of direct calls to `sun.security.action.GetBooleanAction` and `sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo`, because they are not `exports` APIs.\r\n\r\n2. `Channels.newReader` is used instead of ``,StreamDecoder.forDecoder because `StreamDecoder.forDecoder` is also not `exports` APIs.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public static Reader newReader(ReadableByteChannel ch,\r\n                                   CharsetDecoder dec,\r\n                                   int minBufferCap)\r\n    {\r\n        Objects.requireNonNull(ch, \"ch\");\r\n        return StreamDecoder.forDecoder(ch, dec.reset(), minBufferCap);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Adjusted the import of `java.io._` in `yarn/Client.scala` to fix the compilation error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: ] /home/runner/work/spark/spark/resource-managers/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/Client.scala:20: object FileSystem is not a member of package java.io\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Replaced `-target` with `-release` in `pom.xml` and `SparkBuild.scala`, and removed the `-source` option, because using `-release` is sufficient.\r\n\r\n5. Upgrade `scala-maven-plugin` from 4.7.1 to 4.8.1 to fix the error `[ERROR] -release cannot be less than -target` when executing `build/mvn clean install -DskipTests -Djava.version=21`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter Scala 2.13.9, the compile option `-target` has been deprecated, it is recommended to use `-release`:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9982\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-03-26T06:02:18Z","updated_at":"2024-04-01T13:40:05Z","closed_at":"2024-04-01T04:27:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02905db5351c9056b73f3b72972c81e083b369b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b669078baa83ab969f0c16cf6bec26d62a555302","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:scala-maven-plugin-491","ref":"scala-maven-plugin-491","sha":"b669078baa83ab969f0c16cf6bec26d62a555302","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDuring spark submit, for K8s cluster mode driver, instead of always downloading jars and serving it to executors, avoid the download if the url matches `spark.kubernetes.jars.avoidDownloadSchemes` in the configuration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor K8s cluster mode driver, `SparkSubmit` will download all the jars in the `spark.jars` to driver and then those jars' urls in `spark.jars` will be replaced by the driver local paths. Later when driver starts the `SparkContext`, it will copy all the `spark.jars` to `spark.app.initial.jar.urls`, start a file server and replace the jars with driver local paths in `spark.app.initial.jar.urls` with file service urls. When the executors start, they will download those driver local jars by `spark.app.initial.jar.urls`.\r\nWhen jars are big and the spark application requests a lot of executors, the executors' massive concurrent download of the jars from the driver will cause network saturation. In this case, the executors jar download will timeout, causing executors to be terminated. From user point of view, the application is trapped in the loop of massive executor loss and re-provision, but never gets enough live executors as requested, leads to SLA breach or sometimes failure. \r\nSo instead of letting driver to download the jars and then serve them to executors, if we just avoid driver from downloading the jars and keeping the urls in `spark.jars` as they were, the executor will try to directly download the jars from the urls provided by user. This will avoid the driver download bottleneck mentioned above, especially when jar urls are with scalable storage schemes, like s3 or hdfs.\r\nMeanwhile, there are cases jar urls are with schemes of less scalable than driver file server, e.g. http, ftp, etc, or when the jars are small, or executor count is small - user may still want to fall back to current solution and use driver file server to serve the jars.\r\nSo in this case, make the driver jars downloading and serving optional by scheme (similar idea to `FORCE_DOWNLOAD_SCHEMES` in YARN) is a good approach for the solution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nA configuration `spark.kubernetes.jars.avoidDownloadSchemes` is added\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n- Unit tests added\r\n- Tested with an application running on AWS EKS submitted with a 1GB jar on s3.\r\n  - Before the fix, the application could not scale to 1k live executors. \r\n  - After the fix, the application had no problem to scale beyond 12k live executors.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests for MySQL ENUM/SET Types\r\n\r\nIn MySQL/Maria Connector/J, the JDBC ResultSetMetadata API maps ENUM/SET types to `typeId:java.sql.Types.CHAR,typeName:'CHAR'`, which makes it impossible to distinguish them from a normal `CHAR(n)` type.\r\n\r\nWhen working with ENUM/SET, it's possible to encounter char padding issues. However, this can be resolved by setting the LEGACY_CHAR_VARCHAR_AS_STRING parameter to true.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

When doing `iterator()` or `prefix()`, the returned iterator is not sorted on timestamp value. After Anish's PR for supporting range scan encoder, we could integrate it with `TimerStateImpl` such that we will use range scan encoder on `timer to key`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe changes are part of the work around adding new stateful streaming operator for arbitrary state mgmt that provides a bunch of new features listed in the SPIP JIRA here - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45939\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `VariantGet` expression that extracts variant value and casts it to a concrete type. It is exposed as two SQL expressions, `variant_get` and `try_variant_get`. If the extracted path doesn't exist in the source variant value, they should both return null. The difference is at the cast step: when the cast fails,`variant_get` should throw an exception, and `try_variant_get` should return null.\r\n\r\nThe cast behavior is NOT affected by the `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` flag: `variant_get` always has the ANSI cast semantics, while `try_variant_get` always has the TRY cast semantics. An example is that casting a variant long to an int never silently overflows and produces the wrapped int value, while casting a long to an int may silently overflow in LEGACY mode.\r\n\r\nThe current path extraction only supports array index access and case-sensitive object key access.\r\n\r\nUsage examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n> SELECT variant_get(parse_json('{\"a\": 1}'), '$.a', 'int');\r\n 1\r\n> SELECT variant_get(parse_json('{\"a\": 1}'), '$.b', 'int');\r\n NULL\r\n> SELECT variant_get(parse_json('[1, \"2\"]'), '$[1]', 'string');\r\n 2\r\n> SELECT variant_get(parse_json('[1, \"2\"]'), '$[2]', 'string');\r\n NULL\r\n> SELECT variant_get(parse_json('[1, \"hello\"]'), '$[1]'); -- when the target type is not specified, it returns variant by default (i.e., only extracts a sub-variant without cast)\r\n \"hello\"\r\n> SELECT try_variant_get(parse_json('[1, \"hello\"]'), '$[1]', 'int'); -- \"hello\" cannot be cast into int\r\n NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2024-03-25T20:22:28Z","updated_at":"2024-04-02T01:35:30Z","closed_at":"2024-04-02T01:35:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65a943662d2448d5ab2ad88d013855141bb7e466","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45708/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45708/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45708/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0bbc8e9b6a108d9bc61867799ecffb5bce087903","head":{"label":"chenhao-db:variant_get","ref":"variant_get","sha":"0bbc8e9b6a108d9bc61867799ecffb5bce087903","user":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608298960,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEHn0A","name":"oss","full_name":"chenhao-db/oss","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db/oss","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExtend built-in string functions to support non-binary, non-lowercase collation for: replace.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUpdate collation support for built-in string functions in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users should now be able to use COLLATE within arguments for built-in string function REPLACE in Spark SQL queries, using non-binary collations such as UNICODE_CI.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests for queries using StringReplace (`CollationStringExpressionsSuite.scala`).\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Algorithm explanation\r\n\r\n- StringSearch.next() returns position of the first character of `search` string in the `source` source. We need to convert this position to position in bytes so we can perform replace operation correctly.\r\n- For UTF8_BINARY_LCASE collation there is no corresponding collator so we have to implement custom logic (`lowercaseReplace`). It is done by performing matching on **lowercase strings** (`source & search`) and using that information to do operations on the **original** `source` string. String building is performed in the same way as for other non-binary collations.\r\n\r\nSimilar logic can be found in existing `int find(UTF8String str, int start)` & `int indexOf(UTF8String v, int start)`

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe parquet schema converter for Variant assumes that the first two fields in a parquet struct are the value and metadata for Variant, respectively. This isn't very robust, and could break if other writers wrote them in a different order, or if a future extension added new fields to the Variant structure. This PR adds more careful validation of the Variant column based on field names, and fails if there are any unexpected columns.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMake Variant more robust to issues in the parquet schema.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, Variant isn't released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for `Dataset.observe` to the Spark Connect Scala client. Note that the support here does not include listener support as it runs on the serve side.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a small refactoring to the `Observation` helper class. We extracted methods that are not bound to the SparkSession to `spark-api`, and added two subclasses on both `spark-core` and `spark-jvm-client`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the `DF.observe` method is only supported in the Python client.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The user can now issue `DF.observe(name, metrics...)` or `DF.observe(observationObject, metrics...)` to get stats of columns of a dataframe.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new e2e tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNope.","created_at":"2024-03-25T14:08:19Z","updated_at":"2024-05-10T06:55:29Z","closed_at":"2024-05-08T19:44:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4ca062cc70c5b695bf0842fb02e85b159563253","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45701/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45701/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45701/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f9499038083648c61452dda39ac58e37534308e7","head":{"label":"xupefei:scala-observe","ref":"scala-observe","sha":"f9499038083648c61452dda39ac58e37534308e7","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to inferring `dict` as `MapType` from Pandas DataFrame to allow DataFrame creation.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces new config `INFER_PANDAS_DICT_AS_MAP` to reach the goal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently the PyArrow infers the Pandas dictionary field as `StructType` instead of `MapType`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> pdf = pd.DataFrame({\"str_col\": ['second'], \"dict_col\": [{'first': 0.7, 'second': 0.3}]})\r\n>>> pa.Schema.from_pandas(pdf)\r\nstr_col: string\r\ndict_col: struct<first: double, second: double>\r\n  child 0, first: double\r\n  child 1, second: double\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this behavior make Spark cannot handle the schema properly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> sdf = spark.createDataFrame(pdf)\r\n>>> sdf.withColumn(\"test\", F.col(\"dict_col\")[F.col(\"str_col\")]).show()\r\n[INVALID_EXTRACT_FIELD_TYPE] Field name should be a non-null string literal, but it's \"str_col\". SQLSTATE: 42000\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo default behavior changes, but `createDataFrame` inferring `dict` as a `MapType` from Pandas DataFrame when `INFER_PANDAS_DICT_AS_MAP` set to `True`:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```python\r\n>>> pdf = pd.DataFrame({\"str_col\": ['second'], \"dict_col\": [{'first': 0.7, 'second': 0.3}]})\r\n>>> sdf = spark.createDataFrame(pdf)\r\n>>> sdf.withColumn(\"test\", F.col(\"dict_col\")[F.col(\"str_col\")]).show()\r\n[INVALID_EXTRACT_FIELD_TYPE] Field name should be a non-null string literal, but it's \"str_col\". SQLSTATE: 42000\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```python\r\n>>> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.pandas.inferPandasDictAsMap\", True)\r\n>>> pdf = pd.DataFrame({\"str_col\": ['second'], \"dict_col\": [{'first': 0.7, 'second': 0.3}]})\r\n>>> sdf = spark.createDataFrame(pdf)\r\n>>> sdf.withColumn(\"test\", F.col(\"dict_col\")[F.col(\"str_col\")]).show(truncate=False)\r\n+-------+-----------------------------+----+\r\n|str_col|dict_col                     |test|\r\n+-------+-----------------------------+----+\r\n|second |{first -> 0.7, second -> 0.3}|0.3 |\r\n+-------+-----------------------------+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-25T13:31:28Z","updated_at":"2024-04-05T05:44:33Z","closed_at":"2024-03-28T00:30:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8fc5565966dfae0b51bafc4092447f933fd4f5cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23c8d2d11a8c8326fff7e8ef8f017009efab5f37","head":{"label":"itholic:schema_issue","ref":"schema_issue","sha":"23c8d2d11a8c8326fff7e8ef8f017009efab5f37","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

This PR should only be merged after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45383 is merged.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n[SPARK-47296](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45422) introduced a change to fail all unsupported functions. Because of this change expected inputTypes in ExpectsInputTypes had to be changed. This change introduced a change on user side which will print \"STRING_ANY_COLLATION\" in places where before we printed \"STRING\" when an error occurred. Concretely if we get an input of Int where StringTypeAnyCollation was expected, we will throw this faulty message for users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to:\r\n- make the method `castToString(from: DataType): Any => Any` to `castToString(from: DataType): Any => UTF8String` in `ToStringBase`.\r\n- Add UT for `ToPrettyString` to improve the `coverage` of UT.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Let the method return a UTF8String(`Any` -> `UTF8String`), which is more intuitive.\r\n- Currently, `ToPrettyString` lacks the corresponding `UT`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new UT.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-25T03:22:38Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T14:48:14Z","closed_at":"2024-03-25T08:26:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ccc55033fd642eebaea1304f7d55c1721094c780","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45688/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45688/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45688/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ec75e7e2f198151be896129533da70028e0c8c80","head":{"label":"panbingkun:ToPrettyString_improve","ref":"ToPrettyString_improve","sha":"ec75e7e2f198151be896129533da70028e0c8c80","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `commons-logging` dependency in favor of `jcl-over-slf4j`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- https://slf4j.org/legacy.html#jclOverSLF4J\r\n\r\n> To ease migration to SLF4J from JCL, SLF4J distributions include the jar file jcl-over-slf4j.jar. This jar file is intended as a drop-in replacement for JCL version 1.1.1. It implements the public API of JCL but using SLF4J underneath, hence the name \"JCL over SLF4J.\"\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds `UserDefinedType` handling to `DataTypeUtils.canWrite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOur customer hits an issue recently when they tries to save a DataFrame containing some UDTs as table (`saveAsTable`). The error looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Cannot write 'xxx': struct<...> is incompatible with struct<...>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe catalog strings between two sides are actually same which makes the customer confused.\r\n\r\nIt is because `DataTypeUtils.canWrite` doesn't handle `UserDefinedType`. If the `UserDefinedType`'s underlying sql type is same as read side, `canWrite` should return true for two sides.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Write side column with `UserDefinedType` can be written into read side column with same sql data type.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

This change has been co-authored by @ericm-db  and @sahnib \r\n\r\n**Authors: @ericm-db @sahnib**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for expiring state based on TTL for ValueState. Using this functionality, Spark users can specify a TTL Mode for transformWithState operator, and provide a ttlDuration/expirationTImeInMs for each value in ValueState. TTL support for List/Map State will be added in future PRs. Once the ttlDuration has expired, the value will not be returned as part of `get()` and would be cleaned up at the end of the micro-batch. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed to support TTL for ValueState. The PR supports specifying ttl for processing time or event time. Processing time ttl is calculated by adding ttlDuration to `batchTimestamp`, and event time ttl is specified using absolute expiration time (`expirationTimeInMs`). \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, modifies the ValueState interface for specifying `ttlDuration`, and adds `ttlMode` to `transformWithState` API. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test cases for both event time and processing time in `ValueStateWithTTLSuite`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, when a subquery is correlated on a condition like `outer_map[1] = inner_map[1]`, DecorrelateInnerQuery may generate a join on the map itself, which is unsupported, so the query cannot run - for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect * from x where (select sum(y2) from y where xm[1] = ym[1]) > 2;\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [UNSUPPORTED_SUBQUERY_EXPRESSION_CATEGORY.UNSUPPORTED_CORRELATED_REFERENCE_DATA_TYPE] Unsupported subquery expression: Correlated column reference 'x.xm' cannot be map type.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if we rewrite the query to pull out the map access `outer_map[1]` into the outer plan, it succeeds.\r\n\r\nSee the comments in the code at PullOutNestedDataOuterRefExpressions for more details and an example of the rewrite.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEnable queries to run successfully\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, enables queries to run that previously errored.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-03-22T19:12:26Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T02:51:43Z","closed_at":"2024-03-29T02:51:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb7688521620ba6de862a6bef4e8953f44112efb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fc93bce18f717fa9993fc38991b6432bb845c5b3","head":{"label":"jchen5:subquery-nested-expr","ref":"subquery-nested-expr","sha":"fc93bce18f717fa9993fc38991b6432bb845c5b3","user":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":558995069,"node_id":"R_kgDOIVGWfQ","name":"spark","full_name":"jchen5/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr is related to [SPARK-47488](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47488)\r\nThe idea is that, when driver encounters exception, driver will be terminated until sparkcontext is closed if spark runs on k8s,   regardless of whether the non-daemon threads stop or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are migrating spark app on yarn-cluster mode to k8s. When spark app runs on yarn-cluster mode, everything is ok. Driver can terminate normally if encounters exception or err. But running on k8s, driver pod may get stuck when encounters exception even if sparkcontext is closed. We found this problem is caused by non-daemon threads not stopped.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Allow setting partition size (samples per partition)\r\n- Print available options\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe partitions are very small (100k rows), which is not suitable to exemplify compute-expensive workload. These changes allow to run the `SparkPi` example for long durations with high CPU load.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdds another option to the `SparkPi`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf there is only one spill data file, spark will transfer that spill file to the final data file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n  public void transferMapSpillFile(\r\n      File mapSpillFile,\r\n      long[] partitionLengths,\r\n      long[] checksums) throws IOException {\r\n    // The map spill file already has the proper format, and it contains all of the partition data.\r\n    // So just transfer it directly to the destination without any merging.\r\n    File outputFile = blockResolver.getDataFile(shuffleId, mapId);\r\n    File tempFile = Utils.tempFileWith(outputFile);\r\n    Files.move(mapSpillFile.toPath(), tempFile.toPath());\r\n    blockResolver\r\n      .writeMetadataFileAndCommit(shuffleId, mapId, partitionLengths, checksums, tempFile);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if that spill file and the final data file are on different disks, there will still be a heavy data transfer.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsun.nio.fs.UnixCopyFile.transfer(Native Method)\r\nsun.nio.fs.UnixCopyFile.copyFile(UnixCopyFile.java:251)\r\nsun.nio.fs.UnixCopyFile.move(UnixCopyFile.java:471)\r\nsun.nio.fs.UnixFileSystemProvider.move(UnixFileSystemProvider.java:262)\r\njava.nio.file.Files.move(Files.java:1395)\r\norg.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.io.LocalDiskSingleSpillMapOutputWriter.transferMapSpillFile(LocalDiskSingleSpillMapOutputWriter.java:52)\r\norg.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.UnsafeShuffleWriter.mergeSpills(UnsafeShuffleWriter.java:280)\r\norg.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.UnsafeShuffleWriter.closeAndWriteOutput(UnsafeShuffleWriter.java:224)\r\norg.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.UnsafeShuffleWriter.write(UnsafeShuffleWriter.java:180)\r\norg.apache.spark.shuffle.ShuffleWriteProcessor.write(ShuffleWriteProcessor.scala:59)\r\norg.apache.spark.scheduler.ShuffleMapTask.runTask(ShuffleMapTask.scala:99)\r\norg.apache.spark.scheduler.ShuffleMapTask.runTask(ShuffleMapTask.scala:52)\r\norg.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:131)\r\norg.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.$anonfun$run$3(Executor.scala:498)\r\norg.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner$$Lambda$453/980524593.apply(Unknown

can get the disk where the final shuffle data file is located, and spill the final temp shuffle block in that disk to avoid unnecessary data copying.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOptimize spark shuffle performance.\r\n\r\nTest `mv` a 2.6 G file between HDD disks on a node which has a high iowait :\r\n```\r\n$ time mv /hadoop/2/yarn/local/yarn-yarn-nodemanager.log.10 /hadoop/3/yarn/local/yarn-yarn-nodemanager.log.10\r\n\r\nreal\t2m19.694s\r\nuser\t0m0.029s\r\nsys\t0m6.120s\r\n$ time mv /hadoop/3/yarn/local/yarn-yarn-nodemanager.log.10 /hadoop/3/yarn/local/yarn-yarn-nodemanager.log.11\r\n\r\nreal\t0m0.003s\r\nuser\t0m0.001s\r\nsys\t0m0.001s\r\n```\r\nWhen mv file to another disk which has a high iowait is very slow while mv file to the same disk is quite fast.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExists UT\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-22T07:30:42Z","updated_at":"2024-07-07T00:22:43Z","closed_at":"2024-07-07T00:22:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"132a858f021133adcef0efcdfb7021649a6da2eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45661/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45661/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45661/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5cb52bc4ebee4ee6cb1d5389e9b8a6681f88c7da","head":{"label":"wankunde:SPARK-47518","ref":"SPARK-47518","sha":"5cb52bc4ebee4ee6cb1d5389e9b8a6681f88c7da","user":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260172941,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNzI5NDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"wankunde/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde/spark","description":"Apache
