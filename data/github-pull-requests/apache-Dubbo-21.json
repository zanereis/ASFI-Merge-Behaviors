quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

[x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

The one-time created metricsReporter needs to be registered to beanFactory, so that the BaseCommand spi implementation of qos can obtain.\r\n2. exportHttpServer is no longer required\r\n3. The metrics report is at the application level, so the PrometheusMetricsReporterCmd at the frame level needs to traverse the AppModel, and then obtain the corresponding beanFactory implementations.\r\n4.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-03T05:29:27Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T07:06:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-06T07:05:59Z","merged_at":"2023-03-06T07:05:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"b35312ae4951393751060ef3178500162de8252e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11712/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11712/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11712/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4a0e2ec178d05d4e03cb1176d26c1b95710ef37b","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"4a0e2ec178d05d4e03cb1176d26c1b95710ef37b","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-03T03:06:16Z","updated_at":"2023-04-03T08:37:27Z","closed_at":"2023-04-03T08:37:27Z","merged_at":"2023-04-03T08:37:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"f5d1724a655ac20f3beb6a40376b1b07f544fd88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11709/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11709/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11709/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a9115353a5e2fb6447e50b6ab8bf00b68096193e","head":{"label":"erdengk:add_new_unitTest","ref":"add_new_unitTest","sha":"a9115353a5e2fb6447e50b6ab8bf00b68096193e","user":{"login":"erdengk","id":37730787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzMwNzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37730787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk","html_url":"https://github.com/erdengk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":606658452,"node_id":"R_kgDOJCjflA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"erdengk/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"erdengk","id":37730787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzMwNzg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37730787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk","html_url":"https://github.com/erdengk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erdengk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/erdengk/dubbo","description":"Apache

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-02T12:47:14Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T02:40:14Z","closed_at":"2023-03-09T02:40:14Z","merged_at":"2023-03-09T02:40:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"11f45d872603ecb78dbafa6a2099329a08ad0458","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9294d7cabc7bb6e4eba9871526d71bdf1c2669df","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/resolve_samples_dependency_conflict","ref":"feature/resolve_samples_dependency_conflict","sha":"9294d7cabc7bb6e4eba9871526d71bdf1c2669df","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"d3d8c54c74e5ff646213e3670c044387144ed1d9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix reference bean name conflicts \r\n这个问题之前修复过一次，情况没有考虑全面， 启动顺序不同会导致失败\r\neg:\r\n```\r\n@DubboReference\r\nprivate AService aservice;\r\n@DubboReference\r\nprivate AService bservice;\r\n@DubboReference\r\nprivate BService bservice;\r\n```\r\n当 `AService` 扫描完成以后, 容器中为\r\n\r\n1.  ` beanDefintions(\"aservice\",ABeanDefinitonInfo) `\r\n2.  ` alias (\"bservice\",\"aservice\")`\r\n\r\n扫描`BService` 时 容器中为\r\n\r\n1. `BeanDefinitions (\"bservice\":BDefinitionInfo)` \r\n\r\n因为当扫描`BService`  执行到   ` if (beanDefinitionRegistry.containsBeanDefinition(referenceBeanName))`  这里 `referenceBeanName 值为 bservice ` 会返回false， 且`bservice `是第一次注册会直接注册到 BeanDefinitions 中\r\n\r\n此时会出现即注册了 `AService `的alias `bservice` 又注册了 `BService`的 `beanDefinition `的`bservice `，在注入属性时会获取到错误的类型\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n修改判断逻辑 ,同时判断当前 `referenceBeanName `是否在`beanDefinition` 或者是否被注册为别名,\r\n\r\n1. 存在 `beanDefinition`中时 执行旧的逻辑\r\n2. `beanDefinition  `中不存在 但是被注册为别名 则从 别名中获取到 原始的 `beanName `来获取`beanDefinition `信息，后续执行和之前一样的重复处理逻辑\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-01T13:23:23Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T07:05:17Z","closed_at":"2023-03-02T23:15:26Z","merged_at":"2023-03-02T23:15:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"48bc7165f7d81535db35ca8f4eee871261dfb034","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0191051b04fbe9d733da9754af395c3ed7451034","head":{"label":"liufeiyu1002:fix/dubbo_reference_bean_name_conflicts","ref":"fix/dubbo_reference_bean_name_conflicts","sha":"0191051b04fbe9d733da9754af395c3ed7451034","user":{"login":"liufeiyu1002","id":32605119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjA1MTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32605119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002","html_url":"https://github.com/liufeiyu1002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608140828,"node_id":"R_kgDOJD9-HA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"liufeiyu1002/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liufeiyu1002","id":32605119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjA1MTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32605119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002","html_url":"https://github.com/liufeiyu1002","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufeiyu1002/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liufeiyu1002/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-28T16:41:49Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T01:23:39Z","closed_at":"2023-03-01T01:23:39Z","merged_at":"2023-03-01T01:23:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc74f131a73eb2607d3d473496decac36acadb1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e6555e8dd1c5eb1f41f620c4cdf6e7c2e3b02c5c","head":{"label":"mytang0:issue-11690","ref":"issue-11690","sha":"e6555e8dd1c5eb1f41f620c4cdf6e7c2e3b02c5c","user":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":596634531,"node_id":"R_kgDOI4_row","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mytang0/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0/dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-28T10:06:33Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T06:53:00Z","closed_at":"2023-03-06T06:53:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47dacb5b9b1f4f4e8702ce7baca2e1eeedabb007","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/316e588892a4beab7e49b2b96e7357be1a2471c3","head":{"label":"Webster-Yang:core.thread.pool3","ref":"core.thread.pool3","sha":"316e588892a4beab7e49b2b96e7357be1a2471c3","user":{"login":"Webster-Yang","id":5946139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDYxMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5946139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang","html_url":"https://github.com/Webster-Yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358498340,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0OTgzNDA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Webster-Yang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Webster-Yang","id":5946139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDYxMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5946139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang","html_url":"https://github.com/Webster-Yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Webster-Yang/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-28T06:17:52Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T08:05:26Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T08:05:26Z","merged_at":"2023-02-28T08:05:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"ed9e26f0176610e49bc0c8deba9788b7ae1147b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11683/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11683/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11683/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8d579ab2e38b63bccc77d384db2045daf7b03695","head":{"label":"mytang0:optimization_3","ref":"optimization_3","sha":"8d579ab2e38b63bccc77d384db2045daf7b03695","user":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":596634531,"node_id":"R_kgDOI4_row","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mytang0/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0/dubbo","description":"Apache

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-28T03:12:38Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T04:38:53Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T04:38:53Z","merged_at":"2023-02-28T04:38:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"12c8ea19cc834f2ecb0ac7020b217f89e0bfa272","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a07088b7e80e4717ffccc7c93f15019f30d254f8","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0228_grpc","ref":"0228_grpc","sha":"a07088b7e80e4717ffccc7c93f15019f30d254f8","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-27T00:51:22Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T22:34:08Z","closed_at":"2023-03-01T22:34:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2678c3a258c6ef660f075fa05f05aa65eb1d57e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11666/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11666/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11666/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a58d66f22277001a0d7ecf6dfc20a28ac1ba8a97","head":{"label":"Webster-Yang:code.thread.pool2","ref":"code.thread.pool2","sha":"a58d66f22277001a0d7ecf6dfc20a28ac1ba8a97","user":{"login":"Webster-Yang","id":5946139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDYxMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5946139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang","html_url":"https://github.com/Webster-Yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358498340,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0OTgzNDA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"Webster-Yang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Webster-Yang","id":5946139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDYxMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5946139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang","html_url":"https://github.com/Webster-Yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Webster-Yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Webster-Yang/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nBecause the map is ConcurrentHashMap, so mapLock is not necessary to use.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nimprove NacosNamingServiceWrapper performance.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nIn my location benchmark test, the code like this:\r\n```\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testRegisterInstance() throws NacosException, InterruptedException{\r\n        NamingService namingService = new MockNamingService() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void registerInstance(String serviceName, String groupName, Instance instance) throws NacosException {\r\n\r\n

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-26T16:19:17Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T10:42:28Z","closed_at":"2023-03-08T10:42:27Z","merged_at":"2023-03-08T10:42:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0b98b309006379e57be06ad8d0cda2d8920f760","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a1bec871cccee380643a06ee1624c9917689593c","head":{"label":"sourcelliu:improve","ref":"improve","sha":"a1bec871cccee380643a06ee1624c9917689593c","user":{"login":"sourcelliu","id":20898138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODk4MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20898138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu","html_url":"https://github.com/sourcelliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":606484946,"node_id":"R_kgDOJCY50g","name":"dubbo","full_name":"sourcelliu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sourcelliu","id":20898138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODk4MTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20898138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu","html_url":"https://github.com/sourcelliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sourcelliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sourcelliu/dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-26T13:44:15Z","updated_at":"2023-02-27T04:33:04Z","closed_at":"2023-02-27T04:33:04Z","merged_at":"2023-02-27T04:33:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"c4d6f94b2ce16ead95880265749b2ffb9701ecc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3d075a2761598c20914187d52f7f55057f245325","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0226_getconfig","ref":"0226_getconfig","sha":"3d075a2761598c20914187d52f7f55057f245325","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

[dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-25T14:52:28Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T02:03:39Z","closed_at":"2023-02-26T04:06:18Z","merged_at":"2023-02-26T04:06:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2e9dcea33d60d34c2e9b67db731b00db6a0566e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11660/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11660/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11660/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/950992059b4fbc9419bebc6ad2da9b82d6b400a6","head":{"label":"conghuhu:cgq-tracing","ref":"cgq-tracing","sha":"950992059b4fbc9419bebc6ad2da9b82d6b400a6","user":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":544346536,"node_id":"R_kgDOIHIRqA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"conghuhu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"conghuhu","id":56248584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56248584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu","html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conghuhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/conghuhu/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-25T10:05:45Z","updated_at":"2023-02-25T12:12:35Z","closed_at":"2023-02-25T12:12:34Z","merged_at":"2023-02-25T12:12:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e38c48b685b6e47862f697add746b018c745ab0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11656/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11656/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11656/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3604fad6bbd990585bc1d52aa787d3ac05ac8faf","head":{"label":"EarthChen:fix-tri-wrapper-pack-npe","ref":"fix-tri-wrapper-pack-npe","sha":"3604fad6bbd990585bc1d52aa787d3ac05ac8faf","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.1","ref":"3.1","sha":"848edaa80fe4128adb9f8809f776272465b1d18e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-23T15:53:58Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T06:10:54Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T06:10:54Z","merged_at":"2023-04-05T06:10:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"912deb69a8ee5f043a222ddeb2eef1e23d46957f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3ac7b769bb15d9050512b704d89fbdf2ae8e4c82","head":{"label":"JunJieLiu51520:feature/3.2-rest_protocol_provider","ref":"feature/3.2-rest_protocol_provider","sha":"3ac7b769bb15d9050512b704d89fbdf2ae8e4c82","user":{"login":"JunJieLiu51520","id":42363259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzYzMjU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42363259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520","html_url":"https://github.com/JunJieLiu51520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunJieLiu51520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"0d430985a3efe88438e49ad3f935983f8bb59499","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-23T06:40:22Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T22:42:48Z","closed_at":"2023-03-01T22:42:48Z","merged_at":"2023-03-01T22:42:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"6d6e3a5e9e1caa712308ea25ed6b8fef04d15c92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c8020d58eb6eb9c8e49d241adb0d3bd7ae3509d2","head":{"label":"mytang0:refactor-sliding-window","ref":"refactor-sliding-window","sha":"c8020d58eb6eb9c8e49d241adb0d3bd7ae3509d2","user":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":596634531,"node_id":"R_kgDOI4_row","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mytang0/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-22T15:37:48Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T01:49:10Z","closed_at":"2023-03-27T01:49:09Z","merged_at":"2023-03-27T01:49:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"6faf548e2463693e70274015bc8d11d624c12f19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11632/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11632/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11632/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/856b61a928ac5c5c89c15742fe9d56dc688b03ca","head":{"label":"gsralex:add_histogram","ref":"add_histogram","sha":"856b61a928ac5c5c89c15742fe9d56dc688b03ca","user":{"login":"gsralex","id":2240270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDAyNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2240270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex","html_url":"https://github.com/gsralex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":392678450,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTI2Nzg0NTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"gsralex/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gsralex","id":2240270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDAyNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2240270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex","html_url":"https://github.com/gsralex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gsralex/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-22T05:07:30Z","updated_at":"2023-02-23T03:01:21Z","closed_at":"2023-02-23T03:01:21Z","merged_at":"2023-02-23T03:01:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"e7925ceac7b58b9a739652e5011dff57b772bf96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f2ec154d9a707e8c4ce0edbce333ba5bdfab2bb3","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:fix/sync_meter_to_spring_boot","ref":"fix/sync_meter_to_spring_boot","sha":"f2ec154d9a707e8c4ce0edbce333ba5bdfab2bb3","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-19T22:33:42Z","updated_at":"2023-02-20T01:47:42Z","closed_at":"2023-02-20T01:38:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2368dc660827e8b64d57d6db05837b117642a4ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f7face3c826db00d84a0bf9c8b405803aa99bc80","head":{"label":"apache:revert-11577-fix-boxed","ref":"revert-11577-fix-boxed","sha":"f7face3c826db00d84a0bf9c8b405803aa99bc80","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-16T02:03:16Z","updated_at":"2023-02-16T09:02:57Z","closed_at":"2023-02-16T09:02:57Z","merged_at":"2023-02-16T09:02:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"c6cf17ec4a3efaba599a472b9af8ed8f8ec940a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11582/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11582/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11582/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6ffe0f75224734860e1b4153e02fd9ca9c66b25e","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0216_codecov","ref":"0216_codecov","sha":"6ffe0f75224734860e1b4153e02fd9ca9c66b25e","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-15T09:14:19Z","updated_at":"2023-02-15T11:54:14Z","closed_at":"2023-02-15T11:54:13Z","merged_at":"2023-02-15T11:54:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c6857623fac02231a35896555f1334f4b180087","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11580/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11580/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11580/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5605e83fa469828d7886e466a07862b706e2cb7a","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0215_codecov","ref":"0215_codecov","sha":"5605e83fa469828d7886e466a07862b706e2cb7a","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/11021,Dubbo already supports Micrometer Observation API, But when it is not working with springboot3, you need to configure it yourself.\r\nSo I added dubbo-spring-boot-observability-starter to support springboot2.X or without `spring-boot-starter-actuator`\r\nDetails:\r\n ### Add default config for  `micrometer-observation` and `micrometer-tracing`\r\nsee `DubboTracingProperties`\r\n\r\n### If the project is configured with `spring-boot-starter-actuator`, the configuration of `spring-boot-starter-actuator` is preferred\r\n\r\n1. `BraveAutoConfiguration` is used to configure Brave when `spring-boot-starter-actuator` does not exist\r\n2. `OpenTelemetryAutoConfiguration` is used to configure OpenTelemetry when `spring-boot-starter-actuator` does not exist\r\n3. `DubboMicrometerTracingAutoConfiguration` is used to configure MicrometerTracing when `spring-boot-starter-actuator` does not exist\r\n4. `DubboObservationAutoConfiguration` is used to configure Micrometer Observation when `spring-boot-starter-actuator` does not exist\r\n5. `ObservationHandlerGrouping` is used to group `ObservationHandler` by type\r\n6. `ObservationRegistryPostProcessor`  is used to group registry observationHandlers to observationConfig\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for my bad english\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-15T08:27:35Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T22:37:07Z","closed_at":"2023-03-01T22:37:07Z","merged_at":"2023-03-01T22:37:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"34981c9606facf63000264a71d2a69b93afe2fd1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11579/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11579/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11579/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b79d876720352593615edb514a23f4592106a152","head":{"label":"ShenFeng312:autoconfig","ref":"autoconfig","sha":"b79d876720352593615edb514a23f4592106a152","user":{"login":"ShenFeng312","id":49786112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg2MTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49786112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312","html_url":"https://github.com/ShenFeng312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":594323834,"node_id":"R_kgDOI2ypeg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ShenFeng312/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ShenFeng312","id":49786112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg2MTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49786112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312","html_url":"https://github.com/ShenFeng312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShenFeng312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ShenFeng312/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-15T06:29:11Z","updated_at":"2023-02-22T12:54:15Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T12:54:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96f8111a2eed83e7daa716a4d8b541a7ee4b7634","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11575/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11575/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11575/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/727f30ae29bf43de89c0d629b42c0ede3c5910cd","head":{"label":"vio-lin:modify-Groc-constants","ref":"modify-Groc-constants","sha":"727f30ae29bf43de89c0d629b42c0ede3c5910cd","user":{"login":"vio-lin","id":12695349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk1MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12695349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/vio-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140425453,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA0MjU0NTM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"vio-lin/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vio-lin","id":12695349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk1MzQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12695349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/vio-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vio-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vio-lin/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [Y] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-15T06:16:32Z","updated_at":"2023-02-22T12:26:40Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T12:26:40Z","merged_at":"2023-02-22T12:26:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"2897c856741ed7d642de170e6fca782eea92dc5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11574/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11574/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11574/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7d91fc14812d8dea4543532ebb7bb5cc3458d7d6","head":{"label":"mytang0:version","ref":"version","sha":"7d91fc14812d8dea4543532ebb7bb5cc3458d7d6","user":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":596634531,"node_id":"R_kgDOI4_row","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mytang0/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-15T03:01:17Z","updated_at":"2023-02-15T05:35:36Z","closed_at":"2023-02-15T05:35:36Z","merged_at":"2023-02-15T05:35:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ad7e4041edcbfaed1ab9e38c2bc36457dab3d87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6a9af34d0a8e356523fe681ba729782ba1e68378","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0215_fix_serializable","ref":"0215_fix_serializable","sha":"6a9af34d0a8e356523fe681ba729782ba1e68378","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-13T12:12:33Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T22:57:20Z","closed_at":"2023-02-14T22:57:20Z","merged_at":"2023-02-14T22:57:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1baaae71b8f73fd248e7348c24f28554cf1b2e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0321864f4619accb665577712e6a2599e9d1acc3","head":{"label":"mytang0:code-opt","ref":"code-opt","sha":"0321864f4619accb665577712e6a2599e9d1acc3","user":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":596634531,"node_id":"R_kgDOI4_row","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mytang0/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mytang0","id":29346818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MzQ2ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29346818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0","html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mytang0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mytang0/dubbo","description":"Apache
