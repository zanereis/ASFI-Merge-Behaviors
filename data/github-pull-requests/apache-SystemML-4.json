patch introduces a new feature to control the entry to the local lineage cache. If enabled, we delay the caching of the large matrix blocks, which were never cached/evicted before. To avoid unnecessarily restricting entries, we only delay the matrices that are larger than 5% of the available memory. This way we guarantee not delay for larger

Sebastian, \r\nI have closed the pr for this function and made a new one aiming my two PR's would be seperate but it seems they still share the same commit history. Other than that the translate operator in the first PR had some serious performance issues. I have tried to change it as much as possible. I did get rid of one of the loops. In the initial implementation we were assigning values to every index one by one which was inefficient for large matrices. This is not the case anymore. I also used parfor for the outer loop which helped with the performance. I have tried to compare it with the non linear translate operator with random matrices that are 512x512 size. It seems aproximately when we call it with more than 10 images . the linear function seems to catch up to the non linear one . I did this by comparing the system DS execution time that appears after the terminal after compiling the script. Is there a better way of comparing ? I think I could also compare with the time command but it gives 3 different measurements ( real, sys and .. ) I didnt know which one I should primarly focus on. I also added the dml script for test and the java test and looking forward to your

patch enables systemds to be able to impute missing value using KNN-algorithm. We calculate the similairy or distance between all pairs of records using the euclidean distances. The first method brute forces the imputation using the dist() method. However, this could leads to an expensive computation. Therefore, we proposed 2 other methods, the second method split the number of records (potentially large) and compute the distances with missing records(hopefully small). The third method is similar to the second method. However, we create a subset from the number of records to compute with missing records(large).\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-09T10:58:00Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T18:47:42Z","closed_at":"2023-08-15T18:47:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a567747ddf82702b101da7b423655a7b5beb2294","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1879/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1879/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1879/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/666b4f3cc7a3891b2b8d3af83fa2f81b04f1f364","head":{"label":"msanyoto:main","ref":"main","sha":"666b4f3cc7a3891b2b8d3af83fa2f81b04f1f364","user":{"login":"msanyoto","id":57170771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTcwNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57170771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto","html_url":"https://github.com/msanyoto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":675340296,"node_id":"R_kgDOKEDgCA","name":"systemds","full_name":"msanyoto/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"msanyoto","id":57170771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTcwNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57170771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto","html_url":"https://github.com/msanyoto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msanyoto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/msanyoto/systemds","description":"An

PR contains code to compare schema compression with our standard compression. \r\nThere are good indications that the schema apply is much faster, in the currently supported schemas.\r\n\r\nIn the following tables the update scheme takes the compressed scheme from one of the previously compressed blocks, and update the scheme to enable compression of new given blocks.\r\nThe apply scheme takes the scheme and applies to incoming uncompressed MatrixBlocks. \r\nUpdate and Apply does both.\r\nFrom Empty, takes an empty DDC single column scheme (one group per column) and materialize a new scheme

patch adds methods to clean up the child RDDs of lineage cached RDDs. On the first hit, we marked the RDD but let it and its child RDDs get cleaned up by the rmVar logic. On the second hit, we call persist while putting that RDD in the cache. On a later hit, if the RDD is already persisted, we clean up the child RDDs including the checkpointed and broadcast variables. If still not persisted, we asynchronously move the RDD to Spark by triggering a job after a few local reuse. A future reuse then cleans up the child

is an updated implementation of GIO, a system for generating efficient matrix and frame readers for custom data formats by example. Our GIO paper was published in SIGMOD 2023. The main improvements and extensions over the previous implementation are:\r\n\r\n1. Support for both frame and matrix reader generation\r\n2. Support for projection over the selected fields\r\n3. Improved code generation that adapts to single/multi-threaded configuration\r\n4. Support for single/multi-line record representations\r\n\r\nThanks for

PR adds the functionality of propagating the sparsity from the federated workers to the coordinator when executing an instruction without subsequent data consolidation at the worker. To achieve this, the workers respond to a EXEC_INST request with the number of non-zeros of their respective federated partition. Thereby, we can obtain and aggregate the number of non-zeros and subsequently set the number of non-zeros of the (still federated) matrix object.\r\nIn this PR, several instructions have been extended to support the before mentioned sparsity propagation. I also added a respective unit test which compares the propagated number of non-zeros to a reference. Unfortunately, I had to copy parts of the _DMLScript.java_ code into the test class because the test needs direct access to the execution context of the script execution.\r\nAdditionally, I left three types of FIXME comments in the test dml script. In two of these comments, the underlying local operator (_ifelse_ and _cumsum_) returns an incorrect number of non-zeros for some reason that I haven't discovered yet. The other FIXME comment relates to an incorrect computation of instructions like _sum(X!=0)_ which is introduced by rewriting the constructed HOP.\r\nNOTE: This PR is based on #1862 . Hence, we should wait with the merge until the other PR has been resolved.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

PR adds support for non-literal parameters _rows_ and _cols_ in _ReshapeFEDInstruction_ by simply constructing a literal operand for the respective scalar and replacing the corresponding operand of the instruction string. I also changed the DML script of the _FederatedReshapeTest_  such that we materialize one of these parameters as a non-literal.\r\nThis PR implicitly also includes the removal of unused variables inside the _FederatedReaderTest_ and the change of value range of the random matrices in _FederatedMisAlignedTest_.\r\n\r\nThanks for review

commits adds a small but useful extension to lineage-base reuse. We now also reuse the lineage traces corresponding to the reused intermediates by replacing the live lineage traces with the cached ones. This change increases the use of same lineage items in many lineage DAGs, which in turn reduces probing cost and memory overhead. This extension is disabled for parfor and deduplicated lineage traces. Integrating with those require more thoughts.","created_at":"2023-06-29T09:47:11Z","updated_at":"2023-06-29T11:27:36Z","closed_at":"2023-06-29T11:27:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01c92db53eb80fadcbe0d576d7650a6fb9162b6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1853/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1853/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1853/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/93d7a01a271abe4f0e0ef0221d81454f55d33e39","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:experiment4","ref":"experiment4","sha":"93d7a01a271abe4f0e0ef0221d81454f55d33e39","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror

Extended performance testsuite\r\n\r\nThis contains new `.dml` and `.sh` scripts to include perftests for some of the components in `scripts/nn`.\r\nAs a start, 2 perftests for a simple SGD trained regression neural network and a neural network classifier trained while using Nesterov momentum as described in the `scripts/nn/README.md` were added.\r\n(Incidentally also resolved a bug with the batching of training samples in both of these examples in the readme.)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a semi-broken perftest for `staging/NCF.dml` is included. As far as I am aware, the perfest scripts are fine (though currently untested) but the implementation of NCF in staging crashes on launch due to yet undetermined cause.\r\n\r\nThe general structure of the new tests follows observed standards of presently implemented perftests:\r\n\r\n- `scripts/datagen` houses individual `.dml` scripts for data generation\r\n- `scripts/perftest/datagen` contains `.sh` scripts that wrap these `.dml` scripts and designate parameters for the generation based on required file sizes\r\n- `scripts/perftest/scripts` houses `.dml` scripts that implement the workload that is to be tested\r\n- `scripts/perftest` contains `.sh` scripts to run individual or all perftests pertaining to a designated type of component\r\n\r\nCurrently, the parameters in the datagen scripts fail to meet the expected output sizes of 80MB, 800MB etc.\r\nTheir output is currently too small.\r\n\r\nThe `.sh` scripts for the neural network components test various input sizes as given by the `MAXMEM` variable in `runAll.sh` like other perftests and additionally perform individual tests both with a base number of epochs as well as ten times that many epochs eg. 5 and 50 epochs. This seems appropriate since the number of epochs in neural network training is a shorthand parameter for the maximum amount of individual training iterations.\r\n\r\nFinally, `runAll.sh` contains a flag to enable/disable the execution of neural network perftests as well as a flag to toggle the use of the gpu in these tests.","created_at":"2023-06-23T18:10:41Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T03:16:37Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/milestones/1/labels","id":10261193,"node_id":"MI_kwDOArxUbc4AnJLJ","number":1,"title":"systemds-3.2.0","description":"All

patch extends the lineage cache eviction policies to support RDDs persisted at the executors.\r\n- We checkpoint a RDD on the second cache hit (reduce cache pollution).\r\n- While checkpointing, we rely on the worst case size estimations and later update the eviction data structures with actual size once the RDDs are persisted.\r\n- We split the Spark operators into two groups, one for expensive, shuffle-based operations, and another for map-based operations. For the scoring function, we assume the first set is 2x more expensive\r\n- We also track the reference counts of RDDs and use that in the scoring. More references (many consumers) indicates higher importance.\r\n- We reduce the score by one hit count if we collect a persisted RDD. This is to evict the intermediates which are cached at multiple locations.","created_at":"2023-05-27T20:09:21Z","updated_at":"2023-05-27T21:56:24Z","closed_at":"2023-05-27T21:56:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"905a01bbf65b8c9343168b73458c716dfb8bb6c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1834/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1834/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1834/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/2bd4f584fe53d9759aaa81d79f593eef99d12cac","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:sparkEvict1","ref":"sparkEvict1","sha":"2bd4f584fe53d9759aaa81d79f593eef99d12cac","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror

patch adds an initial version of cost-based instruction ordering. The idea is to apply a non-recursive exhaustive search to find all the possible orders and select the order with the minimum cost under memory constraints. We propagate the memory and compute estimates from HOPs to LOPs. Moreover, we simplify the DAG by removing literals and transient read, writes to reduce the search space.","created_at":"2023-05-17T21:00:32Z","updated_at":"2023-05-17T21:53:19Z","closed_at":"2023-05-17T21:53:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a2db6ce4737674e74aed244db959dd3d915f3f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1827/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1827/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1827/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/8f339eb73d3361966cd4f68a8bd1acdd37514da8","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:cost2","ref":"cost2","sha":"8f339eb73d3361966cd4f68a8bd1acdd37514da8","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror
