we want to add a sensor to `Metrics.java`, we synchronize the entire method. However both, `sensors` and `childrenSensors` are concurrent hash maps and full method synchronization is not required. \r\n\r\nThis PR removes the method level synchronization and uses the properties of concurrent hash map to ensure thread safety. \r\n\r\nThe motivation of this change is code hygiene improvement and there is no known bottleneck by this lock contention.\r\n\r\nBehaviour after the change:\r\n- sensors with different names can be added to the `sensors` map concurrently (vs. earlier where only one could be added at a

builds are often waiting unnecessarily on getting an ubuntu node in the post step. The post step sends out an email to the dev mailing list but it does so only for regular branches. For pull requests, it does nothing. However, the check to verify if the build is for a pull request is executed when the node is allocated so the build has to wait for it.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-12-05 at 13 42

unnecessarily request a node if one is not needed.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-12-05 at 13 43

a safety check in `HttpMetricsCollector` - if the `super()` call fails we still want to shut down httpd thread.\r\n\r\nThe issue with `HttpMetricsCollector` is that it starts httpd thread on object creation, not inside `start()` method. However, it's been like that for many years, and I don't want to change the logic since it might introduce issues in other places - I don't have bandwidth to hunt them down, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nSo instead I'm adding a try-finally block in `stop()` which will make sure that http metrics thread is shutdown regardless of whether  or not the super() call was successful.\r\n\r\n### Committer

a batch is failed after reaching its delivery timeout, we do not necessarily know whether the broker actually committed it to disk. For example, in the case of a `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` error, it is possible the leader wrote the batch locally, but failed to commit it to the ISR before expiration of the timeout. Later that batch could still become committed. In this case, the producer should not adjust the sequence numbers of subsequent batches until we know whether or not they could also have become committed. \r\n\r\nPrior to this patch, had logic to handle this case when the retry limit was reached, but we did not update it to account for delivery timeouts as well. This patch fixes the issue and tries to improve test coverage.\r\n\r\nNote this bug was caught by the new tests added in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12873. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

PR adds consumer group protocol changes for supporting rack-aware assignment for consumers. It also enables rack-aware assignment in the range assignor and sticky assignors so that default assignors are rack-aware when consumer rack is configured, improving locality with fetch-from-follower when some racks only contain replicas of a subset of partitions. Rack-aware assignment is performed on a best-effort basis and we prioritize balanced assignment over locality. With sticky assignors, we may perform reassignment to improve locality.\r\n\r\nAll unit tests for range assignor and sticky assignor have been updated to run using both non-rack-aware and rack-aware logic where all partitions are on all racks. This verifies that assignment result  with the old logic in preserved with this PR. Additional unit tests have been added for rack-aware assignment.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-28T21:51:59Z","updated_at":"2022-12-05T15:47:19Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T14:38:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"10cf3263e4249b7e45a3dd02136ffa19ab0b4da0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12914/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12914/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12914/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/b685b3d02d354d26fb16ffcca47179086ee08097","head":{"label":"rajinisivaram:KAFKA-14352-rack-aware-consumer","ref":"KAFKA-14352-rack-aware-consumer","sha":"b685b3d02d354d26fb16ffcca47179086ee08097","user":{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42296329,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjI5NjMyOQ==","name":"kafka","full_name":"rajinisivaram/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram/kafka","description":"Mirror

a user can change the number of partitions of `__consumer_offsets` topic by changing the configuration value for `offsets.topic.num.partitions` or manually by using `./bin/kafka-topics.sh`. For example, the following command changes the number of partitions to 60 for `__consumer_offsets` topic.\r\n`./bin/kafka-topics.sh --topic __consumer_offsets --alter --partitions 60 --bootstrap-server=localhost:9092`\r\n\r\nChanging offsets of this reserved topic leads to problems with consumer group detection of coordinator unless you restart all brokers.  Thus, there is a high probability that is this operations is not done right (i.e. if it is not followed by a cluster restart), users may shoot themselves in the foot.

a consumer group on a version prior to 2.3 is rolled upgraded to a newer version and static membership is enabled in the meantime, the consumer group remains stuck, iff the leader is still on the old version.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that setting `GroupInstanceId` in the response to the leader is only supported from JoinGroup version >= 5 and that `GroupInstanceId` is not ignorable nor handled anywhere else. Hence is there is at least one static member in the group, sending the JoinGroup response to the leader fails with a serialization error.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnsupportedVersionException: Attempted to write a non-default groupInstanceId at version 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, the member stays around until the group coordinator is bounced because a member with a non-null `awaitingJoinCallback` is never expired.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue by making `GroupInstanceId` ignorable. A unit test has been modified to cover this.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

original implementation of the state updater could not\r\nhandle double rebalances within one poll phase correctly,\r\nbecause it could create tasks more than once if they hadn't\r\nfinished initialization yet. \r\n\r\nIn a55071a99fabc9a706afa0e9acddf898c7cd05c4, we \r\nmoved initialization to the state updater to fix this. However,\r\nwith more testing, I found out that this implementation has\r\nit's problems as well: There are problems with locking the\r\nstate directory (state updater acquired the lock to the state\r\ndirectory, so the main thread wouldn't be able to clear the\r\nstate directory when closing the task), and benchmarks also\r\nshow that this can lead to useless work (tasks are being\r\ninitialized, although they will be taken from the thread soon\r\nafter in a follow-up rebalance).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose to revert the original change, and fix\r\nthe original problem in a much simpler way: When we \r\nreceive an assignment, we simply clear out the\r\nlist of tasks pending initialization. This way, no double\r\ntasks instantiations can happen.\r\n\r\nThe change was tested in benchmarks, system tests,\r\nand the existing unit & integration tests. We also add\r\nthe state updater to the smoke integration test, which\r\ntriggered the double task instantiations before.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify

of `ThreadCache`. The original implementation showed significant slow-down when many caches were registered.\r\n\r\n`sizeBytes` was called at least once, and potentially many times in every `put` and was linear in the number of caches (= number of state stores, so typically proportional to number of tasks). That means, with every additional task, every put gets a little slower. This was confirmed experimentally.\r\n\r\nIn this change, we modify the implementation of `ThreadCache` to keep track of the total size in bytes. To be independent of the concrete implementation of the underlying cache, we update the size by subtracting the old and adding the new size of the cache before and after every modifying operation. For this we acquire the object monitor of the cache, but since all modifying operations on the caches are synchronized already, this should not cause extra overhead.\r\n\r\nThis change also fixes a `ConcurrentModificationException` that could be thrown in a race between `sizeBytes` and `getOrCreate`.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation of `syzeBytes` is tested by existing unit tests.\r\n\r\n###

consumer (fetcher) refreshes the preferred read replica only on three conditions:\r\n1. the consumer receives an OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE error\r\n2. the follower does not exist in the client's metadata (i.e., offline)\r\n3. after metadata.max.age.ms (5 min default)\r\n\r\nFor other errors, it will continue to reach to the possibly unavailable follower and only after 5 minutes will it refresh the preferred read replica and go back to the leader.\r\n\r\nA specific example is when a partition is reassigned. the consumer will get NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER which triggers a metadata update but the preferred read replica will not be refreshed as the follower is still online. it will continue to reach out to the old follower until the preferred read replica expires.\r\n\r\nthe consumer can instead refresh its preferred read replica whenever it makes a metadata update request. so when the consumer receives i.e. NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER it can find the new preferred read replica without waiting for the expiration.\r\n\r\nGenerally, we will rely on the leader to choose the correct preferred read replica and have the consumer fail fast (clear preferred read replica cache) on errors and reach out to the leader.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

alternative to going back to the `ConcurrentSkipList`. \r\n\r\nI've read up on testing multi-threaded behavior and I believe it's best to leave the testing as it is for now as testing whether `synchronized` works doesn't always work. I did make sure `./gradlew test` was green on my branch. Happy to be corrected here. \r\n\r\nThis is my first PR. As of the [guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Contributing+Code+Changes), I  that the contribution is my original work and that I license the work to the project under the project's open source license. I see that I also need to make a build trigger request, @ableegoldman I would appreciate one please :) \r\n\r\nI do not believe this requires a documentation update as it is just bringing a method up to standard. Again, happy to help out if it turns out otherwise. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14386\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nThis changes the `ReplicaPlacer` interface to return a class instead of a list of list of integers. There are two reasons for the suggestion. First, as mentioned in the JIRA, it will make the interface, arguably, a bit more readable and understandable by explicitly modeling the idea of topic and partition. Second and more importantly, it makes the interface more extendable in the future. Right now it would be challenging to add more metadata to the response. By having classes, we can easily add fields to them without breaking/changing the interface. For example, in the CreatePartitions RPC we are adding partitions to an existing topic and we might want to add some metadata to response making it clear which partition the assignment starts at which could look something like:\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

Motivation \r\nWe create an instance of ObjectSerializationCache  at https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/network/RequestChannel.scala#L113 which does not get used at all. We always \"add\" to the cache but never retrieve from it (as is evident by the fact that we don't store the reference of the cache anywhere).\r\n\r\nAdding information to the cache is expensive because it uses `System.identityHashCode(Object)` which is expensive as demonstrated by the flame graph of producer requests over Apache Kafka 3.3.1 plaintext broker.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1712\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-11-24 at 13 57 31\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71267/203790570-af710c66-b091-416f-ae0c-c1d7dc9ab732.png\">\r\n\r\nThe above graph is a stack where below the yellow line are all callers of the function. The horizontal axis demonstrates the amount of CPU used by each caller. As you will observe, `KafkaAPIs.handleProduceRequest` is a major contributor to the CPU usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Change\r\nCurrently, the header of a request is parsed by the processor thread prior to adding it to RequestChannel. With this change, we cache the computed size in the `RequestHeader` object itself at the time of parsing the bytebuffer into a `RequestHeader` object. The cached size is re-used when it is required at `RequestChannel`.\r\n\r\n## After the change\r\nNote that the CPU utilization by the above hotspot has been eliminated.\r\n<img width=\"1710\"

`KafkaAPIs.handleProduceRequest` has been eliminated since we don't use `ObjectSerializationCache` in that code path now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-22T13:08:59Z","updated_at":"2022-12-15T20:07:20Z","closed_at":"2022-11-28T14:15:35Z","merged_at":"2022-11-28T14:15:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"edfa894eb5e2c4ba9dd262452781c0786be3f29f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12890/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12890/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12890/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/543786430c97936e2f1e7546a099c95e627bb319","head":{"label":"divijvaidya:KAFKA-14414","ref":"KAFKA-14414","sha":"543786430c97936e2f1e7546a099c95e627bb319","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":472367950,"node_id":"R_kgDOHCfDTg","name":"kafka","full_name":"divijvaidya/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya/kafka","description":"Mirror

I was cherrypicking the fix for \r\nKAFKA-14382 back to older branches, I had been running the StreamThreadTest on all versions before pushing the fix -- but when I got to 3.0, I began to hit some kind of problem with parsing the `settings.gradle` file and was unable to build in my local env. Since everything from 3.3 to 3.1 had passed so far I foolishly assumed \r\nthe fix on 3.0 was fine as well and just pushed it. \r\n\r\nClearly that was rash, as it turned out a method used in the new test did not exist back in 3.0, causing [this commit](https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/0ab8847bfcd5be981fb4b38ace1df415a2ec767d) to break the 3.0 branch. I was only able to figure this out when I opened a PR to sync this commit across other forks and the PR build failed due to the real compilation error rather than whatever was going on with my local gradle build. \r\n\r\nAnyways that's the story, and this is the fix.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-21T23:52:05Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T09:32:33Z","closed_at":"2022-11-22T09:32:32Z","merged_at":"2022-11-22T09:32:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"8425daf92db54e87727600c0a42323f46e52cfc0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/a2231e4f2ca37849db0e07d1ef63707b577e3b5e","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"a2231e4f2ca37849db0e07d1ef63707b577e3b5e","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

default replica selector chooses a replica on whether the broker.rack matches the client.rack in the fetch request and whether the offset exists in the follower. If the follower is not in the ISR, we know it's lagging behind which will also lag the consumer behind. there are two cases:\r\n1. the follower recovers and joins the isr. the consumer will no longer fall behind\r\n2. the follower continues to lag behind. after 5 minutes, the consumer will refresh its preferred read replica and the leader will return the same lagging follower since the offset the consumer fetched up to is capped by the follower's HWM. this can go on indefinitely\r\n\r\nIf the replica selector chooses a broker in the ISR then we can ensure that at least every 5 minutes the consumer will consume from an up-to-date replica. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

current method of computing the member poll duration does not take into account the time spent on connector operations in tick(), which may be significant. This can cause a worker to sleep for longer than intended, and miss execution of background operations such as retries, REST calls, cooperative rebalance delays, and internal signing key rotations.\r\n\r\nInstead, the computation should measure the system time at the end of tick() and use that for computing the time to the next background operation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the title change, add a repro test which fails when the patch is not applied, and refactor the DistributedHerderTest with more accurate expectations for background operations being queued and task configurations being generated.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

for the subtle bug described in KAFKA-14382 that was causing rebalancing loops. If we trigger a new rebalance while the current one is still ongoing, it may cause some members to fail the first rebalance if they weren't able to send the SyncGroup request in time (for example due to processing records during the rebalance). This means those consumers never receive their assignment from the original rebalance, and won't revoke any partitions they might have needed to. This can send the group into a loop as each rebalance schedules a new followup cooperative rebalance due to partitions that need to be revoked, and each followup rebalance causes some consumer(s) to miss the SyncGroup and never revoke those partitions.","created_at":"2022-11-17T03:22:50Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T07:34:57Z","closed_at":"2022-11-19T06:38:58Z","merged_at":"2022-11-19T06:38:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"56ab2f80343d7d842c1b0e3069833106d4fe3259","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cadonna","id":1042170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDIxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1042170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna","html_url":"https://github.com/cadonna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cadonna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mjsax","id":8959638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NTk2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8959638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax","html_url":"https://github.com/mjsax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjsax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/12869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/12869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/17506c97b5c336d9c685b343c1409b1780f19777","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:14382-prevent-StreamThread-from-missing-rebalance-completion","ref":"14382-prevent-StreamThread-from-missing-rebalance-completion","sha":"17506c97b5c336d9c685b343c1409b1780f19777","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

Greg Harris <greg.harris@aiven.io>\r\n\r\nThe Mac.getInstance and KeyGenerator.instance calls used in the DistributedConfig and InternalRequestSignature are hard-to-mock, as they are static methods. This change wraps those static method calls in a dependency-injectable Crypto class, that allows for more simple mocking of the calls.\r\n\r\nSome tests, in particular ones that expect errors to be thrown from the mocked methods, are now mocked where they were not before. Other tests still target the non-mocked methods, in particular InternalRequestSignatureTest which appears to hard-code a particular Mac algorithm.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

this patch, we refactored the existing FindCoordinator mechanism. In particular, we first centralize all of the network operation (send, poll) in `NetworkClientDelegate`, then we introduced a RequestManager interface that is responsible to handle the timing of different kind of requests, based on the implementation.  In this path, we implemented a `CoordinatorRequestManager` which determines when to create an `UnsentRequest` upon polling the request

the addition of the new Processor API the newly added `FixedKeyProcessorNodeFactory` extends the `ProcessorNodeFactory` class.  The `ProcessorNodeFactory` had a private field `Set<String> stateStoreNames` initialized to an empty see.  The `FixedKeyProcessorNodeFactory` also had a private field `Set<String> stateStoreNames`.  \r\n\r\nWhen executing `InternalTopologyBuilder.build`  executing the `buildProcessorNode` method passed any node factory as `ProcessorNodeFactory` and the method references the `stateStoreNames` field, it's pointing to the superclass field, which is empty so the corresponding `StoreBuilder`(s) are never added - causing NPE in the topology.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the field `protected` on the `ProcessorNodeFactory` class so `FixedKeyProcessorNodeFactory` inherits it.\r\n\r\nThe added test fails without

brokers maintain their liveness in the cluster by sending BROKER_HEARTBEAT requests to the active controller; the active controller fences a broker if it doesn't receive a heartbeat request from that broker within the period defined by `broker.session.timeout.ms`. The broker should use a request timeout for its BROKER_HEARTBEAT requests that is not larger than the session timeout being used by the controller; doing so creates the possibility that upon controller failover the broker might fail to cancel an existing heartbeat request in time and then subsequently heartbeat to the new controller to maintain an uninterrupted session in the cluster. In other words, a failure of the active controller could result in under-replicated (or under-min ISR) partitions simply due to a delay in brokers heartbeating to the new controller.\r\n\r\nThis patch updates `BrokerToControllerChannelManager` to decrease the individual request timeout to the provided retry timeout if necessary instead of blindly using the configured controller socket timeout -- it doesn't make sense to calculate an implicit individual request timeout that ends up exceeding an explicitly-configured retry timeout.  We also change the KRaft broker to set the retry timeout to one-half of the broker session timeout, and on the controller side we adjust the amount of time that heartbeat requests may sit in the controller purgatory to match.\r\n\r\nNote that the net effect of this change is to change the timeouts as follows:\r\n**KRaft broker heartbeating**: retry timeout changes from 60 seconds to `broker.session.timeout.ms` / 2, and the request timeout is now the smaller of that retry timeout and `controller.socket.timeout.ms` (which is likely to be the former rather than the latter) instead of blindly using `controller.socket.timeout.ms`.\r\n**Other KRaft broker-to-controller communication (forwarding, auto-topic creation, producer IDs)**: retry timeout changes from `broker.session.timeout.ms` to `broker.session.timeout.ms` / 2, and the request timeout is the smaller of that retry timeout and `controller.socket.timeout.ms` instead of blindly using `controller.socket.timeout.ms`.\r\n\r\nThere are other uses of `BrokerToControllerChannelManager` that are not affected, as follows:\r\n**AlterPartitionManager**: no change to retry and request

`7.6` will be going to introduce a new scala compilation option named `keepAliveMode`. Changing the value of this option from default of `SESSION` to `DAEMON` allows us to reuse scala compilers between build and hence reducing build time. \r\n\r\nAs `7.6` pre-release is already out so we are testing the above feature as part of this PR by updating gradle version to `7.6-rc-3`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

patch adds `joinGroup` to the new `GroupCoordinator` interface and updates `KafkaApis` to use it.\r\n\r\nFor the context, I will do the same for all the other interactions with the current group coordinator. In order to limit the changes, I have chosen to introduce the `GroupCoordinatorAdapter` that translates the new interface to the old one. It is basically a wrapper. This allows keeping the current group coordinator untouched for now and focus on the `KafkaApis` changes. Eventually, we can remove `GroupCoordinatorAdapter`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

[KIP-882](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-882%3A+Make+Kafka+Connect+REST+API+request+timeouts+configurable)\r\n- Add a request query parameter `timeout` to the endpoints: `PUT\r\n/connector-plugins/{pluginName}/config/validate`, `POST /connectors` and `PUT /connectors/{connector}/config`\r\n- Add a new worker configuration to set an upper bound for the `timeout` query parameter allowing users to potentially configure a longer timeout for exceptional situations (the existing default timeout was 90 seconds).\r\n- Forward `POST /connectors` and `PUT /connectors/{connector}/config` requests to the leader even before doing a config validation to avoid doing double config validations when the requests are made to a non-leader worker.\r\n- Abort `POST /connectors` and `PUT /connectors/{connector}/config` requests if the request timeout is exceeded by the config validation that is done before writing the config to the config backing store. Before this change, users would get a `500` response with a timeout error message, but the connector would still be created / updated if the config validation eventually completed successfully which is very counter-intuitive.\r\n- Add unit tests and basic integration tests wherever applicable.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-13T14:19:21Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T12:58:49Z","closed_at":"2023-07-04T12:58:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21acad71c329580164b3657e0b8f7cfaa471d18e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale
