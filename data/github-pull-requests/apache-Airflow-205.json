google-cloud-storage client sets a timeout of 60s for all requests and defaults to uploading and downloading files in a single request. When working with large files or slow connections, users might need to either increase the timeout or set a chunk size so that the sdk uses chunked uploads and downloads. This patch adds optional chunk_size and timeout arguments to the upload and download methods of the gcs hook and pins google-cloud-storage to a version that supports timeouts for all applicable methods.","created_at":"2020-12-18T18:03:48Z","updated_at":"2020-12-24T13:12:07Z","closed_at":"2020-12-24T13:12:07Z","merged_at":"2020-12-24T13:12:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"323084e97ddacbc5512709bf0cad8f53082d16b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

snowflake, everything is uppercase. In get_pandas_df this could be inconvenient. Sometimes you have to access certain columns, and you don't want to type the name of the columns in uppercase. This is especially inconvenient if you are migrating from Redshift or another DW to Snowflake, because you have to change all your pandas code. \r\n\r\nI aim to solve this with this PR. If you include a boolean in the extra field of your snowflake connection as True, all the columns will get lowercase automatically.\r\n\r\nI guess this needs test, but I have no idea how to begin.

S3KeySizeSensor that allows checking the S3 object sizes or perform any other actions needed by users.\r\n\r\n**Motivation:**\r\n\r\nSince Dec 1, 2020 [Amazon S3 delivers strong read-after-write consistency automatically for all applications](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/amazon-s3-now-delivers-strong-read-after-write-consistency-automatically-for-all-applications/). It's mean that we need rely not only on the fact that S3 object exists but also on its size.\r\n\r\n**Why not change `S3KeySensor`?**\r\nI believe that it's an independent use-case. When we have a custom function that decides if the list of S3 objects is satisfying some criteria (by default size > 0)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example of usage:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef check_zip_only_fn(data: List) -> bool:\r\n        return sum([\r\n            f.get('Size', 0) for f in data\r\n            if isinstance(f, dict)\r\n            and str(f.get('Key')).endswith('zip')\r\n            ]) > 100000\r\n\r\ns3 = S3KeySizeSensor(\r\n        task_id='s3',\r\n        mode='reschedule',\r\n        bucket_name='some-s3-bucket',\r\n        summarizer_fn=check_zip_only_fn,\r\n
