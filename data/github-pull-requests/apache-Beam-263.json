(Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nPreviously:\n- Any user-specified OutputTimeFn overrode the WindowFn#getOutputTime\n- WindowFn#getOutputTimeFn provided a default OutputTimeFn\n- The default varied from \"earliest\" to \"end of window\"\n\nNow:\n- The user-specified OutputTimeFn is used to combine the WindowFn's\n  assigned output timestamps.\n- The WindowFn does not provide the default.\n- The default is always to output at end of window.\n\nFor each of the tests that this effects, I had a choice: either update the timestamps in the test to be the end of window, or explicitly reset the windowing strategy to choose the minimum timestamp. The latter generally gets more useful coverage, since the latter is fairly trivial, so I generally favored it. It is also easier to migrate to. And most of the tests are overspecified anyhow and should not be examining the timestamps.\n","created_at":"2016-05-06T03:12:00Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T03:10:19Z","closed_at":"2016-05-09T17:12:21Z","merged_at":"2016-05-09T17:12:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"3755c5579de3c46202a32b3ac2774ab440cf42f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/296/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/296/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/296/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/3755c5579de3c46202a32b3ac2774ab440cf42f3","head":{"label":"kennknowles:OutputAtEndOfWindow","ref":"OutputAtEndOfWindow","sha":"3755c5579de3c46202a32b3ac2774ab440cf42f3","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

Since the batch runner only supports global windows, I've filtered those tests out. I added the `UnsupportedOperationException` to the windowing translator so I could distinguish them.\n2. Those tests that have simple & supported pipelines succeed at building the pipeline, but somehow the graph is empty - I have checked and it seemed like translators are not even being invoked. This is beyond my current scope of digging in.\n3. Some other tests fail with other misc errors. Perhaps they use state, which results in `NullPointerException`.\n4.

[x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nThese are some moderately useful preliminaries that came out of a quick attempt to try out the `RunnableOnService` tests with the Flink runner. The attempt got a bit stuck, but I figured these alteration might be useful either way.\n\nIf you are curious, translation seems to just not be invoked in my configuration, which you can see in the

pull request adds the counterpart of the UnboundedFlinkSource, the `UnboundedFlinkSink` which uses the `Write` API. Users have requested this multiple times, e.g. to use the Flink Kafka Producer in a Beam program. In the long run we will opt only for Beam IO interfaces. I would like to replace the custom Flink sources and sinks as soon as we have the relevant connectors for users in place. In the meantime, users can explore the potential of Beam using also native backend connectors.

(Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nThis allows the executor to be ignorant of the mapping from PValue to\nConsumers, as well as allowing the TransformExecutor to pass bundles\nthat should only be consumed by specific PTransforms. This can occur if\na transform is incapable of processing a bundle.\n\nThis lets us schedule unprocessed elements (caused, for example, by a\nside input that is not ready) by placing them back on the

a flaky KafkaIO test.\n\nKafkaIO reader reads from Kafka in a separate thread. As a result, `start()` or `advance()` might not read a record with in 10 millis timeout even from the mock kafka consumer. Updated one test that manually reads from KafkaIO reader to invoke `advance()` in a loop.\n\nThis should fix the flaky test. I am running these tests in a loop on my desktop to verify. One thing I can not explain is the following log from the failed jenkins build linked in BEAM-220 (the log was same when I reproduced it locally):\n\n```\nApr 22, 2016 7:04:10 AM org.apache.beam.sdk.io.kafka.KafkaIO$UnboundedKafkaReader advance\nINFO: Reader-0: first record offset 0\n```\n\nIt is entirely clear if this is from the failed test, but `first record offset 0` implies the `start()` must have returned true.\n","created_at":"2016-04-25T18:53:26Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T20:49:35Z","closed_at":"2016-04-25T20:48:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cd9de096f5000c292b2260a350e6c9d0c985647","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/237/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/237/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/237/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/768fcb7e1e0367c3928766c9a7fbabf7336b171f","head":{"label":"rangadi:flaky","ref":"flaky","sha":"768fcb7e1e0367c3928766c9a7fbabf7336b171f","user":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53447194,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzQ0NzE5NA==","name":"beam","full_name":"rangadi/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi/beam","description":"Mirror

(Even better, enable\n     Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\n- [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\n     number, if there is one.\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\n     [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\n\n---\n\nThis is to easily support wholesale replacement of composite transforms.
