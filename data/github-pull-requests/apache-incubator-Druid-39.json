Description\r\nFixes a bug with nested column range index value range computation that can lead to incorrect values matching filters when the range is not present in the nested fields local dictionary.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by checking that the computed local start and end index values global id mapping does not violate the computed original global id range whenever the actual global ids are not present in the local dictionary. That's a lot of words thats probably hard to follow, but its basically an off by 1 error when mapping the global range to the local range in certain cases.\r\n\r\nThis wrong behavior was accidentally encoded in a test I wrote which would have caught the issue if the test had been expecting the correct answer, so I went through and manually verified that the tests are _actually_ expecting the correct thing this time, as well as tried to get 100% coverage on everything which matters in practice, which is now pretty high\r\n<img width=\"649\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-02 at 2 08 41 AM\"

hit in regular operation such as calling next on an iterator before calling hasNext, etc, which I cannot hit during normal usage of the index supplier.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixes a bug with nested columns when using filters that use range indexes such as greater/less than or like filters.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-02T09:25:35Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T05:42:16Z","closed_at":"2022-11-03T04:37:41Z","merged_at":"2022-11-03T04:37:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"018f9847819dee9b2750e1f0cd3a546edb7737f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a flaw in Parquet list conversion for nullable lists of nullable complex elements (groups with many fields, etc), which is amusingly similar to #5433, which I fixed for avro and thought I had addressed for direct group conversion in #6360, but was missing this case. We did cover the other common list form conversions, we just weren't unwrapping stuff in this form\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\noptional group a2 (LIST) {\r\n  repeated group list {\r\n    optional group element {\r\n      optional int64 b1;\r\n      optional int64 b2;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich has been added in this PR.\r\n\r\nI've also cleaned some stuff up around conversion, and made some changes in preparation of adding support for Parquet to nested column indexers and expression transforms, via some of the same flattener/conversion mechanisms we use for flattenSpec.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixes an issue with Parquet list conversion, where lists of complex objects could unexpectedly be wrapped in an extra object, appearing as `[{\"element\":<actual_list_element>},{\"element\":<another_one>}...]` instead of the direct list.\r\n\r\nImportantly, this changes the behavior of the parquet reader for lists of structured objects to be consistent with other parquet logical list conversions. Previously, this data would have to have been retrieved via this `element` as part of a jsonpath or jq flattenSpec, but now will be fetched directly, more closely matching its expected structure.\r\n\r\nFor example, prior to this patch due to the unhandled logical list conversion, data of the form `{\"list\":[{\"x\":1, \"y\":2},{\"x\":3, \"y\":  4}]}`, to extract x you would have to specify `$.list[0].element.x`. After this patch, the data would be extracted using `$.list[0].x`.\r\n\r\nIf you have any existing flattenSpec which are dependent on the current unintuitive behavior, they should be adjusted to drop the 'element' from the path.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-02T00:42:45Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:14:20Z","closed_at":"2022-11-04T12:25:43Z","merged_at":"2022-11-04T12:25:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"e60e305ddb71131133fdea994cc0f2d619b22fd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

clusters with a large number of segments, the duty `MarkAsUnusedOvershadowedSegments`\r\ncan take a long very long time to finish. This is because of the costly invocation of \r\n`timeline.isOvershadowed` which is done for every used segment in every coordinator run.\r\n\r\nThis is extravagant as there are only a few overshadowed segments which are already identified\r\nas part of the datasource snapshot. In clusters with ~500k segments, this duty can take several\r\nminutes to finish even when no segment is actually overshadowed.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Use `DataSourceSnapshot.getOvershadowedSegments` to get all overshadowed segments\r\n- Iterate over this set instead of all used segments to identify segments that can be marked as unused\r\n- Mark segments as unused in the DB in batches rather than one at a time\r\n- Refactor: Add class `SegmentTimeline` for ease of use and readability while using a\r\n`VersionedIntervalTimeline` of segments.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThe changes here provide significant improvement in the run time of this duty.\r\nThe number of overshadowed segments in a given coordinator run is expected to be small.\r\nEven in the rare bad case scenario (half of all used segments are overshadowed), this change\r\nwould halve the run time of the duty. Subsequent runs would again take negligible time.\r\n(Absolute worst case scenario would be a single segment overshadowing everything 😅)\r\n\r\nFurther improvements can be made to the run time of this duty but that would require changes to the\r\nlogic of `timeline.isOvershadowed` and would provide only minor time reductions.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

The need for these items, and verification of their functionality, comes from tests for a few private extensions.\r\n\r\nThis PR also standardizes various \"Unauthorized\" messages to avoid the persistent issues with security ITs where the expected message does not match the one Druid delivers, because Druid used multiple variations of the same message.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nThere are no user-visible changes in the PR. All changes relate to unit tests.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

tasks include the ability to fetch existing segments and determine\r\nreasonable defaults for granularitySpec, dimensionsSpec, and metricsSpec.\r\nThis is a useful feature that makes compact tasks work well even when the\r\nuser running the compaction does not have a clear idea of what they want\r\nthe compacted segments to be like.\r\n\r\nHowever, this comes at a cost: it takes time, and disk space, to do all\r\nof these fetches. This patch improves the situation in two ways:\r\n\r\n1) When segments do need to be fetched, download them one at a time and\r\n   delete them when we're done. This still takes time, but minimizes the\r\n   required disk space.\r\n\r\n2) Don't fetch segments on the main compact task when they aren't needed.\r\n   If the user provides a full granularitySpec, dimensionsSpec, and\r\n   metricsSpec, we can skip it.","created_at":"2022-10-28T21:44:07Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T07:04:04Z","closed_at":"2022-11-07T09:20:15Z","merged_at":"2022-11-07T09:20:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"227b57dd8e1afed9c6696ae7780b8d222f6798bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2835139332,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM1MTM5MzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Compaction","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\n(Updating the PR with docs and tests)\r\n\r\nMSQ uses durable storage for storing temporary data and stage outputs in fault-tolerant mode. In case of a successful exit, the durable storage would get cleaned up once these files are no longer required. However if the worker/controller tasks exit abruptly, the durable storage wouldn't get cleaned up automatically which can result in unrequited temporary folders polluting the durable storage. \r\nThis PR adds an Overlord helper which periodically cleans up these stray directories from the durable storage if enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nTo be added\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DurableStorageCleaner`\r\n * `DurableStorageCleanerConfig`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes a pretty good blunder I made which resulted in the `FixedIndexed` implementations used by the nested columns not be thread safe, leading to undefined behavior when multiple readers are accessing the nested column global dictionaries at the same time. My intention was that `FixedIndexed` was using the positional read methods of `TypeStrategy`, so it should be thread-safe, however, the `TypeStrategy` employed here were not actually overriding these methods, so it was falling back to a positional read that sets the buffer position, reads, and then resets to the original position, which is most unchill in this scenario.\r\n\r\nIn addition to implementing these methods for long/double/int strategies being used here, I also made a change to switch nested columns to use `FixedIndexed` in a supplier, to save heap footprint per https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12277#discussion_r1004350233. This change also would have made it thread safe had I not overridden these methods of `TypeStrategy` since the lazy creation of `FixedIndexed` now happens per thread.\r\n\r\nI added a more direct test on `NestedDataColumnSupplier`, which was prior to this PR only tested indirectly through native and SQL query tests, to perform basic selector and bitmap index operations, and included a concurrent read test. The concurrency test failed consistently prior to the changes in this PR, but i ran on repeat ~200 times after the changes with no failures.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixes a bug with concurrent reads of nested columns with numeric global value dictionaries which could lead to undefined behavior when returning or filtering on nested numeric values.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-26T10:45:08Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:15:01Z","closed_at":"2022-10-28T00:58:25Z","merged_at":"2022-10-28T00:58:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"acb9cb022711f7c9aa3158aec0f79869fa6a7469","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

However, there are a few discrepancies in the current implementation which lead to uneven distribution and slower convergence in the presence of segments with multiple granularities\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `sortingCost` which is a simple optimization of the original cost. It produces the same cost function in the presence of multiple granularities while being just as fast, if not faster, than cachingCost\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR.

See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the Druid Leader selector, we have 2 states only. Either the process is a leader or not. \r\nBut we need a 3rd state which represents an initialized leader on which external callers should gate on.\r\n\r\nAccording to the zookeeper, once we receive the callback inside `LeaderLatchListener#isLeader()` that candidate is the leader. In Druid, we can take some time in running the `DruidLeaderSelector#listener` since there are a lot of DB operations done in both the overlord and the coordinator which can take time. Also for all \"endpoints\", a leader is usable only when it's initialized. \r\n\r\n \r\n Another race condition was how `CuratorDruidLeaderSelector` was updating the boolean variable `leader`. \r\n As `DruidLeaderSelector#listener#becomeLeader()` can take some time to run, zk can choose to change leadership behind the scenes. So now we can have two processes thinking they are the leaders. \r\n \r\n Changed `CuratorDruidLeaderSelector#isLeader()` to gate on the \"latchStatus\" rather than the local boolean `leader` variable. \r\n \r\nAs the `leader` variable is updated in a single-threaded executor service the following situation can very well happen. \r\nLets say we have two overlords foo, bar. \r\n\r\n```\r\n t0: foo is chosen the leader by ZK,  print \"Grayskull\"----------------------------------------t10: initialized \r\n ----t1: notLeader listener is called but is waiting cause exec is single threaded -------------------t11: bar isNotLeader()-> leader =false\r\n -------t2: bar is leader, print \"Grayskull\"-----------t5: initialized \r\n```\r\nBetween t5-t11, both foo,bar think they are the leaders. \r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidLeaderSelector`\r\n * `CuratorLeaderSelector`\r\n * `DruidCoordinator`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

aggregation functions are documented as creating sketches. However, they are planned into native aggregators that include finalization logic to convert the sketch to a number of some sort. This creates an inconsistency: the functions sometimes return sketches, and sometimes return numbers, depending on where they lie in the native query plan.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes these SQL aggregators to _never_ finalize, by using the \"shouldFinalize\" feature of the native aggregators. It already existed for theta sketches. This patch adds the feature for hll and quantiles sketches. [Side note: an alternate approach would have been to disable finalization _entirely_ for the queries planned by SQL, and in cases where we want it, inject an explicit finalizing post-aggregator. I didn't do this, because it would have been a bigger change and I wanted to focus on fixing the behavior of these three functions first.]\r\n\r\nAs to impact, Druid finalizes aggregators in two cases:\r\n\r\n- When they appear in the outer level of a query (not a subquery).\r\n- When they are used as input to an expression or finalizing-field-access post-aggregator (not any other kind of post-aggregator).\r\n\r\nWith this patch, the functions will no longer be finalized in these cases.\r\n\r\nThe second item is not likely to matter much. The SQL functions all declare return type OTHER, which would not be usable as an input to any other function that makes sense and that would be planned into an expression.\r\n\r\nSo, the main effect of this patch is the first item. To provide backwards compatibility with anyone that was depending on the old behavior, the patch adds a \"sqlFinalizeOuterSketches\" query context parameter that restores the old behavior.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n1) Move various argument-checking logic from runtime to planning time in\r\n   DoublesSketchListArgBaseOperatorConversion, by adding an OperandTypeChecker.\r\n\r\n2) Add various JsonIgnores to the sketches to simplify their JSON representations.\r\n\r\n3) Allow chaining of ExpressionPostAggregators and other PostAggregators\r\n   in the SQL layer.\r\n\r\n4) Avoid unnecessary FieldAccessPostAggregator wrapping in the SQL layer,\r\n   now that expressions can operate on complex inputs.\r\n\r\n5) Adjust return type to thetaSketch (instead of OTHER) in\r\n   ThetaSketchSetBaseOperatorConversion.","created_at":"2022-10-20T20:19:50Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:14:27Z","closed_at":"2022-11-03T16:43:00Z","merged_at":"2022-11-03T16:43:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f90589ce538a96b04830c377220a3e7e1adbd2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":283617667,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM2MTc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Incompatible","name":"Incompatible","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

The existing pac4j authenticator works for authenticating web users while accessing the console, whereas this authenticator is for validating Druid API requests made by Direct clients.

is a bug (race condition) in HttpPostEmitter where the emitting thread is getting prematurely stopped while there is data to be flushed.\r\n\r\n`HttpPostEmitter.close()` does following\r\n\r\n```\r\nObject lastBatch = concurrentBatch.getAndSet(null);\r\nif (lastBatch instanceof Batch) {\r\n          flush((Batch) lastBatch);\r\n        }\r\n      \r\n```\r\n \r\nif the emitting thread is stopped, the `flush` call will hang. In each run, emitting thread checks if `concurrentBatch.get()` returns null.  If null is returned, it will flush the batch and shut itself down. It's possible that `flush(batch)` in `HttpPostEmitter.close()` gets invoked after the emitting thread shuts down. \r\n\r\nThis race condition is more likely if flushMillis is set to a lower value. When that happens, the event loop in the emitting thread runs more frequently.  The race condition can easily be reproduced by adding below code to `HttpPostEmitter.close()` and running `EmitterTest.testTimeBasedEmission`\r\n\r\n```\r\n       Object lastBatch = concurrentBatch.getAndSet(null);\r\n        Thread.sleep(60000);   // new code that is to be added\r\n        if (lastBatch instanceof Batch) {\r\n          flush((Batch) lastBatch);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nWith MSQ submitting the tasks containing SQL which might have sensitive keys like AWS's secrets in them, they can get logged in the file if the SQL contains them.\r\nWhile this is not a secure way to specify the credentials since they might get logged & reported at multiple places, this PR  aims to mask these sensitive keys in the log files using a simple regex search and replace.\r\n\r\nFor GCS and Azure input sources, the credentials cannot be specified in the InputSource itself therefore we donot need to search and mask their keys in the SQL. \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n#####

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\n-->\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\n-->\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes issues where tasks stop ingesting but continue running when overlord leader changes occur.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nWhen an overlord switch occurs right after it has issued a pause to a streaming ingestion task, the task remains in a paused state even after the overlord re-election(s).\r\nThe task however continues to run until its duration elapses. This leads to a continuous increase in lag for partitions corresponding to the task(s) until its completion, when a new task can begin ingesting.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nIn the first supervisor run after a restart, resume all active tasks at the end of `discoverTasks`.\r\nA resume doesn't affect an actively reading task adversely and publishing tasks are not resumed.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\n-->\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

For example: -->\r\n\r\nIt's possible in kinesis ingestion for closed and empty shards to be considered during assignment of shards to tasks. This could potentially lead to a skew in the data processed by workers. since some tasks may have more closed and empty shards in their assignment.  [#12235](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12235) was raised to solve this by adding a flag skipIgnorableShards . When this flag is set, supervisor would try to exclude such useless (aka ignorable) shards from assignment. However, after more careful analysis, it turns out that the flag is not really needed due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- [#12787](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12787) points out that the flag never worked at all due to a bug in its implementation\r\n- When there are too many shards (100's or 1000's due to resharding), setting flag can be very expensive and the supervisor can take a long time to start because of the overhead in determining which shards can be ignored.\r\n- repartitionTransitionDuration is the period after which new assignment to tasks happens if the set of active shards has changed. A supervisor can begin ingesting early and once the tasks discover that closed and empty shards are present or even if closed shards have been completely read, a new allocation of the currently active shards to the stream occurs after this duration (2 minutes by default). As a result the ignorable shards are not considered for the next assignment.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

was found that the `namespace/cache/heapSizeInBytes` metric that tracks the total heap size in bytes of all lookup caches loaded on a service instance was being under reported. We were not accounting for the memory overhead of the String object, which I've found in testing to be ~40 bytes. While this overhead may be java version dependent, it should not vary much, and accounting for this provides a better estimate. Also fixed some logging, and reading bytes from the JDBI result set a little more efficient by saving hash table lookups. Also added some of the lookup metrics to the default statsD emitter metric whitelist.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes two bugs, the first around the SQL planner for `JSON_VALUE` queries using the \"returning\" syntax with SQL `DECIMAL` types incorrectly being inferred to have a `STRING` output, which prevents them from working correctly with vectorized math expressions, such as\r\n\r\n```JSON_VALUE(x, '$.y' RETURNING DECIMAL) + 100```\r\n\r\nThey should now correctly be determined to be Druid native `DOUBLE` type which will allow vectorized math expressions (which require numeric inputs) to not violate a check.\r\n\r\nThis was actually triggering another bug, where the `VirtualColumns.canVectorize` check was using a `ColumnInspector` which did not have access to the column capabilities of the other virtual columns, while `getColumnCapabilities` did, which would sometimes lead to them not agreeing. The inspector missing the virtual columns would result in `null` capabilities, which is treated as a missing column for the purposes of vectorization check, while `getColumnCapabilities` used later during expression planning would have the correct virtual column identifier types.\r\n\r\nWhile writing the test for this issue, I stumbled into yet another bug, this one around the fact that vector math processors were not zeroing out 'null' values in the value vector, which would cause anything downstream that was not checking the null vector to produce incorrect results from stale values in the 'null' positions. Most typically, this would be when `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=true` which is also the default mode, but luckily is fairly unlikely to happen unless expressions were explicitly producing null values before being used in part of sum or some other thing that does not check the null vector in default value mode. Numeric nested literal columns also are impacted by this issue, since they always write out a null value bitmap even in \"default\" value mode, because they write out bitmap for all values, and rely on downstream selectors to just ignore the null vector in default mode.\r\n\r\nFinally, I questioned why the numeric math expressions required all the inputs to be numeric instead of scalar in order to vectorize. Since the vector processors that drive them have implicit casts to ensure the correct type is used, we can allow cases where a string is one of the arguments to provide vectorized versions of the non-vectorized behavior, where if one of the arguments is a `STRING`, the output type is `DOUBLE`. There was a flaw in the `VectorMathProcessors.makeMathProcessor` which didn't match the non-vectorized behavior which has also been fixed (this code path was not able to be hit because of the previous checks to ensure all numeric args so no behavior has been changed).\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-12T00:02:10Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T02:27:47Z","closed_at":"2022-10-12T23:28:42Z","merged_at":"2022-10-12T23:28:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"6eff6c9ae42c7a4689bd77e2337735c9edf38c54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nFixes a mistake in `NestedFieldLiteralColumnIndexSupplier` when creating `NullValueIndex`, where it was incorrectly always returning the bitmap for the first dictionary entry, instead of first confirming that this value is actually `null`. While the global value dictionary entry 0 is always null, within the local dictionary of the nested literal column, dictionary id must point to the global id 0 for the first bitmap entry to be the null value bitmap. If this is not the case, an empty bitmap should be used since the column contains no null values.\r\n\r\nThis fixes queries using `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` filters on nested columns that do not contain a null value in every segment, which presents as having a single value per segment matched and returned in the results\r\n\r\n<img width=\"446\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-11 at 12 26 35 AM\"

#13182.\r\n\r\nPR #12944 added a check at the execution layer to avoid materializing excessive amounts of time-granular buckets. This patch modifies the SQL planner to avoid generating queries that would throw such errors, by switching certain plans to use the timestamp_floor function instead of granularities. This applies both to the Timeseries query type, and the GroupBy timestampResultFieldGranularity feature.\r\n\r\nThe patch also goes one step further: we switch to timestamp_floor not just in the ETERNITY + non-ALL case, but also if the estimated number of time-granular buckets exceeds 100,000.\r\n\r\nFinally, the patch modifies the timestampResultFieldGranularity field to consistently be a String rather than a Granularity. This ensures that it can be round-trip serialized and deserialized, which is useful when trying to execute the results of \"EXPLAIN PLAN FOR\" with GroupBy queries that use the timestampResultFieldGranularity feature.","created_at":"2022-10-11T03:44:57Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:15:20Z","closed_at":"2022-10-17T15:22:45Z","merged_at":"2022-10-17T15:22:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"6aca61763ef16f232c0059c4eaade0e59acf774a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

Current Implementation\r\nIn the current MSQ implementation, each worker maintains a ClusterByStatisticsCollector. If we are clustering by time, one sketch is maintained for each time chunk. During the merge, we sent the entire ClusterByStatisticsCollector from the worker to the controller. These are merged together, downsampling if memory taken is too much and partitions are generated from this.\r\n\r\n### Potential Improvements\r\n\r\nTaking all worker sketches into controller memory is an unneeded step, which leads to downsampling of sketches and generating partitions outside the targeted weight. Since we have a primary partitioning on time, we only need to maintain the sketch from all workers for a particular time partition, generate the partition and remove the sketches. This is the sequential sketch merging approach. \r\n\r\nSince this increases time taken however, this has been moved to a separate WorkerSketchFetcher. This will use an executor service to avoid blocking the main controller thread. This will not remove the current functionality, it will only uses sequential merging under cases that it is likely to provide greater benefits. For small sketches, it continues to fetch the entire sketch for the speed.\r\n\r\n### Key changes\r\n* Add a new phase to controller: `MERGING_STATISTICS` and necessary transitions\r\n* Change worker to now send a WorkerReport to the controller, which contains information necessary to fetch sketches later.\r\n* Change the sketch fetching a pull from the controller instead of a push from the worker.\r\n* Add WorkerSketchFetcher to fetch sketches in the background.\r\n\r\n### Context changes\r\n* Add a new parameter `clusterStatisticsMergeMode`. It controls whether to parallel or sequential merging of worker sketches. Can be `PARALLEL`, `SEQUENTIAL` or `AUTO`. On `AUTO` tries to find the best approach based on number of workers and size of input rows.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n* Removes an API on ControllerChatHandler `/keyStatistics/{queryId}/{stageNumber}/{workerNumber}` \r\n* Adds an API on ControllerChatHandler `/partialKeyStatisticsInformation/{queryId}/{stageNumber}/{workerNumber}` that accepts an object that is deserializable to PartialKeyStatisticsInformation.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ClusterByStatisticsCollector`\r\n * `WorkerClient`\r\n * `ControllerClient`\r\n * `StageDefinition`\r\n * `WorkerSketchFetcher`\r\n * `ControllerStageTracker`\r\n * `ClusterByStatisticsWorkerReport`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

support for partial pushdown of joins (having duplicates or output referencing columns) as filters was added. Still  currently in a list of joins, we stop converting joins to filters as soon as one of them doesn't convert fully to a filter. This change allows for all joins to covert to filters fully or partially maintaining that : \r\n1. If a join has duplicates or output referencing columns, then the join is partially converted\r\n2. If a join table uses the output of a second join table in the matching condition, then the second join table won't be fully converted to a filter\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIn MSQ, there can be an upper limit to the number of worker warnings. For example, for parseExceptions encountered while parsing the external data, the user can specify an upper limit to the number of parse exceptions that can be allowed before it throws an error of type `TooManyWarnings`. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes it so that if the user disallows warnings of a certain type i.e. the limit is 0 (or is executing in `strict` mode), instead of throwing an error of type `TooManyWarnings`, we can directly surface the warning as the error, saving the user from the hassle of going throw the warning reports.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ControllerImpl`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#12881\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR lays the ground work to allow load queue to safely have an unlimited number of items, and thus\r\neventually phase out `maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue` and `replicationThrottleLimit`.\r\n\r\nLoad queue is already allowed to have unlimited items (by setting `maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue = 0`)\r\nbut this leads to\r\n- each coordinator run taking a very long time\r\n- poor assignments which take several more runs to be rectified\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n#### Classes to review\r\n- `StrategicSegmentAssigner`\r\n- `LoadRule`, `BroadcastDistributionRule`, `DropRule`, `Rule.SegmentActionHandler`\r\n- `SegmentLoadQueueManager`\r\n- `LoadQueuePeon`: http and curator\r\n- `SegmentHolder`\r\n- `ServerHolder`\r\n\r\n#### Behavioral changes\r\n\r\nChange | Motivation\r\n--------|-------------\r\nBoth loaded and loading items count towards replication. | Allow coordinator to take corrective action of removing superfluous replicas without waiting for them to be fully loaded.\r\nLoad, drop or move operations can be cancelled. | - Allow move of loading items from queue of one server to another. <br> - Allow coordinator to take corrective actions quickly.\r\nDuring tier shift, always maintain the currently configured level of replication, no matter which tier it happens to be on. | - Queue drop of unneeded segments as soon as possible, thus allowing faster decommission of servers and freeing up disk space to load new segments.<br>- Always maintain target level of replication, thus ensuring that segment read concurrency does not suffer\r\nLoadQueuePeon can distinguish and prioritize segment actions as DROP > LOAD > REPLICATE > MOVE (i.e. balancing). | - Allow prioritization of items, which becomes important if load queue size is unlimited. <br> - Avoid considering balancing items in load queue as over-replicated.\r\n`replicationThrottleLimit` does not act on a tier if the segment is not loaded on that tier at all | Throttling first replica on a tier undermines the purpose of tiering. Tiering is not meant for fault tolerance, rather serving different query needs. Thus segments should be available on target tiers as soon as possible.\r\n`maxNonPrimaryReplicantsToLoad` does not act on first replica in any tier | This was done keeping in line with the changes to `replicationThrottleLimit`\r\nnum items in load queue at start of run + num items assigned to load queue during run must be <=`maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue` | Currently, if the configured load queue size is large enough to allow load of some segments while a coordinator run is in progress, the load queue limit is violated as there is always some room in the queue. This causes coordinator runs to get stuck cycling through all the segments in spite of a limited load queue.\r\n\r\n#### Structural changes\r\n\r\nChange | Motivation\r\n--------|-----------\r\nAdd `StrategicSegmentAssigner` which handles all segment assignments. The lifecycle of the assigner is tied to a single coordinator run. | - Allow reuse of logic for loading, balancing and broadcasting. <br> - Single place to maintain state of a single run thus allowing better metrics and logging.\r\nLoad rules just specify their desired state and leave the actual decision making to the `StrategicSegmentAssigner`. | Simpler logic for load rules.\r\nAdd `SegmentLoadQueueManager` that interacts with the load queues. | - Single place to interact with load queue <br>- Allow reporting of metrics from queue callbacks. <br>- Prevent callbacks from holding references to items from the previous coordinator run.\r\n\r\n#### New metrics\r\n- `segment/loadQueue/assigned`\r\n- `segment/loadQueue/success`\r\n- `segment/loadQueue/cancelled`\r\n- `segment/loadQueue/failed`\r\n- Added dimension `\"datasource\"` to most segment level metrics\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n\r\nThe Druid coordinator has been completely revamped to make it much more stable and user-friendly. This is accompanied by several bug fixes, logging and metric improvements and a whole new range of capabilities.\r\n\r\n__Features__:\r\n- Coordinator now supports a `smartSegmentLoading` mode, which is enabled by default. When enabled, users need not specify any of the following dynamic configs as they would be ignored by the coordinator. Instead, the coordinator computes the optimal values of these configs at run time to best utilize coordinator runs.\r\n  - `maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue`\r\n  - `maxSegmentsToMove`\r\n  - `replicationThrottleLimit`\r\n  - `useRoundRobinSegmentAssignment`\r\n  - `useBatchedSegmentSampler`\r\n  - `emitBalancingStats`\r\nThese configs are now deprecated and will be removed in subsequent releases.\r\n- Coordinator is now capable of prioritization and cancellation of items in segment load queues. Simply put, this means that the coordinator now reacts faster to changes in the cluster and makes better segment assignment decisions. \r\n    \r\n__Monitoring__:\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-10T02:48:38Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T04:19:20Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T08:57:36Z","merged_at":"2023-06-19T08:57:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"50461c3bd58da60ec3cdfbc9a962d4a594ec7c6a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"capistrant","id":7452350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTIzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7452350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/capistrant","html_url":"https://github.com/capistrant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capistrant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capistrant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capistrant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capistrant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capistrant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capistrant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capistrant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capistrant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capistrant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

JDBC timeouts on long queries by returning empty batches when a batch fetch takes too long. Uses an async model to run the result fetch concurrently with JDBC requests.\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n\r\nDruid's Avatica-based JDBC handler is not the preferred way to run long-running queries in Druid.\r\n\r\nDruid supports the Avatica JDBC driver. Avatica uses HTTP requests to communicate with the server. When using JDBC with long-running queries, the HTTP request can time out, producing an error. This PR uses an internal feature of JDBC to avoid timeouts by returning \"empty batches\" of rows when Druid takes too long to return the actual rows. The JDBC client automatically requests more rows, resulting in Druid queries running asynchronously with JDBC requests. The result is that JDBC queries no longer time out.\r\n\r\nThis feature is enabled by default with a timeout of 5 seconds. You can modify the time out by changing the `druid.sql.avatica.fetchTimeoutMs` property to the new timeout. Specify the timeout in milliseconds. Druid enforces a minimum of 1000 milliseconds to prevent hammering of the Broker.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDruid's Avatica handler implementation already uses async execution to open and close the \"yielder\" for a query. This PR extends the idea by using the same executor for fetches. The fetch state (yielder, fetch offset) resides in a new `ResultFetcher` class that is invoked on each request to get results.\r\n\r\nThe async logic is simple:\r\n\r\n* If a future exists from the previous fetch exists, use it.\r\n* Otherwise, invoke the fetcher using the existing `ExecutorService` which returns a future.\r\n* Wait for the future to finish, but only up to the fetch timeout.\r\n* If the wait times out, save the future and return an empty batch.\r\n* If the results arrive in time, return them.\r\n\r\nThe close operation is modified to wait for any in-flight fetch to return before shutting down the result set. A `ResultFetcherFactory` creates the fetcher for each query. The factory is needed only to allow introducing artificial delays for testing.\r\n\r\nThe Avatica handler tests are cleaned up to eliminate some redundancy. This then allowed tests for async to be created with less copy/paste than with the existing code.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [X] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #13166.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.

and the Druid team recently introduced the new MSQ framework for batch queries (which we will informally call MSQb here.) We would like to bring the MSQ goodness to Druid's interactive queries, to provide an MSQ-interactive (or MSQi). The needs of a batch engine are vastly different than the needs of an interactive engine: this is why both Spark and Presto (or Drill or Impala) exist. It is why MSQb runs via the Overlord, while interactive queries run via the Broker. This PR is a first of many steps to evolve Druid's low-latency query path toward being multi-stage. That is, this is the first step toward MSQi.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses a the industry-standard notion of an operator DAG as discussed in [Issue #11933](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11933). Please see that issue for the motivation. Please see the `README.md` file for a technical overview. The basic idea (thanks to @imply-cheddar) is to retain (for now) the existing `QueryRunner` structure, but \"shim in\" operators in place of `Sequence`s. This then sets us up to evolve the `QueryRunner` classes in later PRs. The result is that we move from one fully-working state to another, with each step moving us toward the MSQi goal.\r\n\r\nThis PR is large and complex, but it does present the entire operator architecture. We may find that we wish to divide this PR into smaller chunks. Those smaller PRs can refer back to this one for the \"big picture.\"\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces an [earlier PR #12641](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12641) that presented an earlier version of this work which was closed to allow us to focus on MSQb at that time.\r\n\r\nThe PR is currently a draft to allow us to cross-check that each converted operator incorporates any recent changes from the corresponding `QueryRunner` and `Sequence` classes.\r\n\r\n## Highlights of This PR\r\n\r\nIncluded here:\r\n\r\n* Operator definition and associated \"helper\" classes.\r\n* Query and fragment structure to run a DAG of operators.\r\n* A \"generic\" set of operators for common operations (limit, merge, etc.)\r\n* Conversion of the Scan query to use operators in place of `Sequence`s.\r\n* Conversion of the TimeSeries query as above.\r\n* A configuration layer that allows the new path to be enabled. (It is disabled by default.)\r\n* Revised `QueryLifecycle` and `QueryResponse` classes that can run the query either as old-school `Sequence`s or as the new `Fragment` structure.\r\n* Unit tests for all of the new code.\r\n* Rerun of all \"Calcite query\" tests with the operator path enabled.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this PR is to introduce the basics of the operator approach. Functionally, the new and old approaches produce identical results. In a few places, the new approach exploited optimizations which skip unnecessary steps. Extreme stress tests (reading 5 million generated rows) shows that the operator path has lower overhead, but that gain is unlikely to be visible except for very large result sets.\r\n\r\n## Operators\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on the operator concept discussed in detail in the issue cited above. It is may be helpful to summarize the key ideas. An operator does one task in a data pipeline. Calcite converts a SQL query to a tree of \"logical operators\". In most engines, a rewrite step then converts the logical plan to a physical plan, complete with distribution decisions. The physical plan is executed as a DAG of physical operators.\r\n\r\nHistorically, Druid converts the Calcite logical plan tree to a native query, then executes the native query as a set of `QueryRunner/Sequence` pairs. At a very high conceptual level, a \"fragment\" is somewhat the execution of a native query, while operators are like a `Sequence`. The design, however, is much different at the next level down.\r\n\r\nAn operator does one thing, and is independent of the rest of the code except at three interface points:\r\n\r\n* The \"parameters\" given to a specific operator instance (what to sort, the limit to apply, what to merge, etc.)\r\n* The shape of the incoming (upstream) rows.\r\n* The shape of the outgoing (downstream) rows.\r\n\r\nOperators are simple, stateful classes that can be composed in any number of DAG structures, and can be unit tested in isolation. Later in the MSQi project, we will convert directly from the Calcite logical operators to a description (plan) of the physical operators, which is then used to create operator instances. For now, we stick with the detour to native queries so we can make small, incremental steps that move from one working state to the next.\r\n\r\nThe key operator abstractions include:\r\n\r\n* `Operator`: an interface for a data pipeline component. An operator can be opened to provide an iterator over results, then closed. An operator can have zero inputs (a leaf operator), one input (a filter, limit or projection operator) or multiple inputs (join, merge, union, etc.)\r\n* `ResultIterator`: a super-simple iterator over the results (rows, batches) which an operator produces. Uses an exception to signal EOF, which reduces the code needed in a data pipeline relative to the Java iterator protocol.\r\n\r\nMultiple variations of operators are provided in this PR. All of these operators are simple in the sense that they only refer to other operators, but not to any of Druid's query infrastructure.\r\n\r\n* `LimitOperator`: applies a limit to a result set.\r\n* `NullOperator`: does nothing, like an empty list or empty iterator.\r\n* `MappingOperator`: takes one input and applies some form of mapping as defined by a derived class.\r\n* `ConcatOpreator`: performs a union of its inputs, emitting each one after the other.\r\n* `WrappingOperator` similar to \"baggage\" on sequences: an operator that does tasks at the start and end, of result set, but imposes no per-row overhead.\r\n* And many more.\r\n\r\nThere are also native-query-specific operators for the Scan and Timeseries queries. As it turns out, there are many code paths common to all native queries. Operators exist for this path as well so that for Scan and Timeseries, it is \"operators all the way down\" while for other query types it is a mix of operators and `Sequence`s -- until we convert those other native queries later.\r\n\r\n### General Operators\r\n\r\nAnother group of operators are those common to all native queries, and are specific to Druid's implementation:\r\n\r\n* `CpuMetricOperator` a \"wrapper\" operator that gathers CPU metrics.\r\n* `SegmentLockOperator` implements the pin of each segment as the query runs.\r\n* `MergeOperator` generic priority queue ordered merge.\r\n* And many more.\r\n\r\n### Scan Operators\r\n\r\nOperators for the scan query:\r\n\r\n* `CursorReader` reads from one or more `Cursor`s.\r\n* `ScanQueryOperator` replaces the `ScanQueryEngine`, which pretty much reads from a set of cursors.\r\n* `GroupedScanResultLimitOperator`, `UngroupedScanResultLimitOperator`: limit operators for scans.\r\n* `ScanResultOffsetOperator`: offset operator for scans.\r\n* `ScanListToArrayOperator`, `ScanCompactListToArrayOperator`: unpacks scan \"batches\" to individual rows.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, these are the only scan-specific operators required.\r\n\r\n### TimeSeries Operators\r\n\r\nFor the Time Series query:\r\n\r\n* `TimeseriesEngineOperator` replaces the `TimeseriesQueryEngine` to read from one or more cursors (vectorize or non-vectorized).\r\n* `IntermediateAggOperator` to perform streaming aggregation of time groups.\r\n* `GrandTotalOperator` to perform the second-stage aggregation for time series including a \"grand total\" row.\r\n* Misc. plumbing classes, including one that tames the otherwise-wild `VectorCursorGranularizer` class.\r\n\r\n## Fragments\r\n\r\nOperators combine to form a data pipeline. Data pipelines are distributed, as in Druid's scatter/gather architecture. A common terminology is to say that the entire query forms a DAG. The DAG is \"sliced\" at node boundaries, with exchanges between slices. At runtime, a *slice* is replicated across many nodes. Each instance of a slice is a *fragment*.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides the basics of the query and fragment structure.  We discussed above how, in most engines, a planner converts SQL into a logical plan, then into a physical plan that describes the operator DAG. Slices of that plan are sent to nodes which then execute the fragments.  Druid, however, already has a mature, existing scatter/gather structure based around `QueryRunner`s, and we mentioned our goal is to reuse what exists, making incremental changes along the way. In the PR, we retain the majority of the native query structure. Fragments are introduced as a way of managing the group of operators needed for a single native query on one node. When queries run in the \"Calcite test\" framework, we simulate distribution via worker threads. In this case, we have a query with multiple fragments (one per thread.) A query structure acts as the overall structure which ties the fragments together. This PR does not introduce new exchange methods: it simply fits itself into the existing scatter/gather structure. Again, all this will evolve later, but we have to start simple.\r\n\r\n* `FragmentContext`: the state shared by all operators in a fragment. For now, this state includes the `ResponseContext` and, internally, the collection of all operators that form the fragment.\r\n* `FragmentManager`: orchestrates the steps to build and run an individual fragment.\r\n* `QueryManager`: is the \"container\" for all fragments in a query.\r\n\r\nWe will need a way to pass fragment information to `QueryRunner`s so that they can create operators for a fragment. It turns out that `QueryPlus` is handy way to accomplish this: it now holds a `FragmentManager` used by query runners to build their operators. A simplified form, `FragmentContext`, makes fragment-level resources (timeout, response context, etc.) available to operators.\r\n\r\n## Query Runners\r\n\r\nWe've noted that Druid already has an existing `QueryRunner` based structure which we reuse in this PR. The `QueryRunner.run()` method can actually be seen as being a `QueryPlanner.plan()` method: the method decides which sequences are needed to run a query. The sequences do the actually running. In this light, it is easy to see how we convert to operators: the `QueryRunner.run()` method creates an operator instead.\r\n\r\nOur long-term goal is to retire the `QueryRunner` classes. Thinking ahead, the \"planning\" code can be gathered up in a \"native query planner\" (akin to `QueryKit` in MSQb). In anticipation, each converted `QueryRunner` calls to a \"query planner\" class to decide which operator(s) to create. In some cases, the operator is a 1:1 replacement for a sequence. In other cases, it turns out we can optimize the query by omitting unneeded operators, or by using one of several finely tuned operators in place of the generalized sequence in the existing code. It should be clear how, in a later step, a new native query planner  will call these methods directly without the need to first pass through a `QueryRunner`.\r\n\r\nThe general pattern is:\r\n\r\n* Accept a `QueryPlus` and an upstream `QueryRunner`.\r\n* Create an operator which runs the `QueryRunner`.\r\n* Convert the resulting sequence to an \"input operator.\"\r\n* Decide which operator(s) we need to add to perform the task at hand.\r\n* Wrap the result in a sequence compatible with the return value of `QueryRunner.run()`.\r\n\r\nThis PR converts two entire native queries, and the common parts of other queries. As a result, for those partially-converted queries, we have a combination of sequences and operators. A set of shims allows operators to read from sequences, and to masquerade as sequences. This allows operators to seamlessly insert themselves into a sequence-based execution pipeline. When two operators are adjacent, the intervening sequence is optimized away, leaving the the two operators to talk directly. As the conversion continues, there will be more operators and fewer in the execution pipeline.\r\n\r\n## Query Lifecycle\r\n\r\nThe `QueryLifecycle` class runs a native query and is where we make the decision to use the \"traditional\" execution path (based on `Sequence`) or \"MSQi\" execution path (based on operators). That decision is based on a configuration property, as explained below. If we execute the query the traditional way, the object handed to the caller is a `Sequence`. If we go the new route, the returned object is a `FragmentManager`. As it turns out, @imply-cheddar recently added a `QueryResponse` object which is perfect for this: that class wraps the two alternatives in a common interface. Our API level expects a sequence, so the fragment-based `QueryResponse` simply wraps the operator DAG in a sequence (plus a bit of overhead.)\r\n\r\n### Bootstrap\r\n\r\nThe `QueryNGModule` defines a `QueryManagerFactory` which is injected into `QueryLifecycleFactory`. That factory then creates a `QueryLifecycle`. The query lifecycle checks if the query is enabled (as described above) using the config attached to ``QueryManagerFactory `. If so, it then uses ``QueryManagerFactory `` to create a `FragmentManager` which is then attached to the `QueryPlus` for that query. \r\n\r\nFrom then on, each `QueryRunner` checks if there is a `FragmentManager` instance attached to the `QueryPlus`. If so, the query runner creates an operator (if that query runner has been converted to do so), else it executes the \"classic\" code path to create a sequence.\r\n\r\nNote that, if the mechanism is not enabled (the default in this PR), there will never be a `FragmentManager` attached to the `QueryPlus`, and so execution will ignore the operator path.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nAt present, the operator path is experimental, and thus disabled by default. The new path is enabled by setting a system property: `-druid.queryng.enabled=true` on the command line or in a properties file. Just to be clear: even if this flag is set, Druid will happily use the existing path for any queries not yet converted to use operators.\r\n\r\n## Query, Fragment and Operator Profiles\r\n\r\nSince this change is purely at the \"plumbing\" level, it is hard for the casual observer (or even the dedicated developer) to see if we execute one path or another. The new \"native query planner\" methods work hard to optimize away bits of functionality not needed for a query, but it is hard to see that in action. We also want to know, in general, how much data flows through operators and how long things take. To address all of these concerns, the code provides a \"profile\" mechanism to gather basic stats per operator, then present them for a fragment or overall query. Since we don't yet have a good place to store such profiles, they are simply written to the log when enabled. Example:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nQuery ID: 50496d1d-b9fd-4e3e-8dc9-42195a534eeb\r\nRuntime (ms): 4\r\nQuery Type: TimeseriesQuery\r\n\r\n-- Root Slice  --\r\n\r\nproject-sql-results\r\n|   row-count: 1\r\n| \r\ntimeseries-to-array\r\n|   row-count: 1\r\n| \r\ncpu-time\r\n|   cpu-time-ns: 145000\r\n| \r\nfinalizer\r\n|   row-count: 1\r\n| \r\nintermediate-agg\r\n|   group-count: 1\r\n|   row-count: 1\r\n| \r\nsegment-retry\r\n|   try-count: 1\r\n|   missing-segment-count: 0\r\n| \r\nfinalizer\r\n|   row-count: 1\r\n| \r\nintermediate-agg\r\n|   group-count: 1\r\n|   row-count: 1\r\n| \r\nfinalizer\r\n|   row-count: 1\r\n| \r\nintermediate-agg\r\n|   group-count: 1\r\n|   row-count: 1\r\n| \r\nordered-scatter-gather\r\n|   input-count: 1\r\n|   row-count: 1\r\n| \r\nSlice 2\r\n\r\n-- Slice 2  --\r\n\r\nFragment 1\r\n\r\ntimeseries-engine\r\n  vectorized: true\r\n  row-count: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nOne of the very handy things about operators is that they are highly modular and thus extremely easy to unit test. Tests exist for all the basic abstractions defined above. Further, all SQL `CalciteQueryTest` queries were run with the mechanism enabled.\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to introduce the operator framework with two concrete implementations, starting with the simpler queries so attention can focus on the framework, less on the nuances of the more complex native queries. This PR is a fully-functional replacement for the two native queries, though it is disabled by default. As already noted, future PRs will convert other operators, then begin to convert query runners to an MSQi version of `QueryKit`. This then allows us to introduce the MSQb frame concept and to add multi-tier queries for expensive merges, for joins and so on.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.1</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve performance characteristics of UnknownFieldSet parsing (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9371\">#9371</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.0</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix compiler warnings issue found in conformance_test_runner <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8189\">#8189</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8190\">#8190</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix MinGW-w64 build issues.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nApplies to #12904.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nKubernetes client API jar v.11.0.0 contains several critical security vulnerabilities.  Adopting v16 requires two small changes to the existing code:\r\n1. a new constructor parameter has been added to the ApiClient\r\n2. the ApiClient config now requires the date formatter used to parse the timestamps in the k8s metadata.\r\n3. pod metadata can be null, which creates an NPE attempting to extract information.  This is treated the same as if the pod itself were null, an existing condition.\r\n\r\nThe date parsing in particular is necessary to handle the possible date format differences.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n- pom change to bump the k8s client jar version\r\n- constructor change - ApiClient now requires an additional parameter\r\n- APIClient config change - requires a custom data parser to support he data format used by druid.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
