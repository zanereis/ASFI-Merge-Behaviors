PROPOSAL\r\n## NOT A PULL REQUEST\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a problem with creating custom serdes for my custom models. I realized that I make lots of boiler plate code, so I came up with `BaseSerde` class, so creating new custom serdes comes to:\r\n```\r\npublic class CustomSerde extends BaseSerde<Custom> {\r\n  \r\n  private CustomSerde() {\r\n    super(Custom.class);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  public static Serde<Custom> serde() {\r\n    return new CustomSerde();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd then you can simply do: `CustomSerde.serde()`\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this approach?

unclean leader election is enabled dynamically on brokers, we notify controller of the update before updating KafkaConfig. When processing this event, controller's decision to elect unclean leaders is based on the current KafkaConfig, so there is a small timing window when the controller may not elect unclean leader because `KafkaConfig` of the server was not yet updated. The PR fixes this timing window by using the existing `BrokerReconfigurable` interface used by other classes which  rely on the current value of `KafkaConfig`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

removes a listener, waits for the config to be propagated to all brokers and then validates that connections to the removed listener fail. But there is a small timing window between config update and Processor shutdown. Before validating that connections to a removed listener fail, this PR waits for all metrics of the removed listener to be deleted, ensuring that the Processors of the listener have been shutdown.\r\n\r\nRan the test with the fix 1000 times over the weekend without any failures.

topic.replace conversion of dots to underbars in topic values for Fetcher metrics, so topic values are consistent across metrics.\r\n\r\nThe original `topic.replace` code was introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/939 following a pattern where the topic value would be prefixed with \"topic-\" and dots would be converted to underbars. This pattern was then partially backed out, leaving the dots conversion by mistake.\r\n\r\nNote that all other metric collections use the topic value as-is without conversion, so this change should align topic values from Fetcher with other metric topic values. The failure to align only happens when the topic value has a dot, so is understandably hard to find otherwise.","created_at":"2019-03-11T00:54:35Z","updated_at":"2024-12-22T03:39:12Z","closed_at":"2024-12-22T03:39:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

poll is called which resets the offsets to the beginning, followed by a seekToEnd and a position, it could happen that the \"reset to earliest\" call in poll overrides the \"reset to latest\" initiated by seekToEnd in a very delicate way: \r\n1. both request has been issued and returned to the client side (listOffsetResponse has happened)\r\n2. in Fetcher.resetOffsetIfNeeded(TopicPartition, Long, OffsetData) the thread scheduler could prefer the heartbeat thread with the \"reset to earliest\" call, overriding the offset to the earliest and setting the SubscriptionState with that position.\r\n3. The thread scheduler continues execution of the thread (application thread) with the \"reset to latest\" call and discards it as the \"reset to earliest\" already set the position - the wrong one.\r\n4. The blocking position call returns with the earliest offset instead of the latest, despite it wasn't expected.\r\n\r\nThe fix makes the TopicPartitionState in SubscriptionState synchronized and starts to track the requested reset timestamp. With this we can precisely decide if the incoming offset reset is really what we want (by comparing the timestamp set when assigning for reset and the one that is actually used on seek). Therefore the latest initiated offset reset will happen only. Synchronization furthermore ensures that this is done in an atomic manner to avoid further similar bugs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

currently use 10 seconds as the timeout for ConsoleConsumer process to be started in ConsumerGroupCommandTest. For tests using SSL, this requires SSL keystores to be created first and then the process is started. Looking at successful test runs, it typically takes between 5 and 7 seconds to start SSL-enabled consumer process. But there have been several test failures that show `Consumer was too slow to start` in tests using SSL. The logs from the last two failures in ConsumerGroupCommand test had consumers which successfully started with SSL, but took ~13 seconds to log their first message. Hence changing the timeout to 20 seconds in system tests that check for consumer start up.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-

change aims to prevent records that cannot be deserialized from going into a global state store during restore. Currently such records are filtered during normal operations but will be processed during restore and will cause an exception when trying to access the value in the store.\r\nThe change copies the logic from the GlobalStateUpdateTask and builds a list of deserializers to use during restoration.\r\n\r\nThe GlobalStateManagerImplTest was extended to cover the case that a StreamsException is expected when a record is processed that can't be deserialized with the default LogAndFailExceptionHandler.\r\nGlobalStateManagerImplLogAndContinueTest was added and contains one new test which uses the LogAndContinueExceptionHandler and verifies that a record can be ignored during restoration.\r\nCopying all tests is not ideal, but I found no easy way to override the DefaultExceptionHandler just

change aims to prevent records that cannot be deserialized from going into a global state store during restore. Currently such records are filtered during normal operations but will be processed during restore and will cause an exception when trying to access the value in the store.\r\nThe change copies the logic from the GlobalStateUpdateTask and builds a list of deserializers to use during restoration.\r\n\r\nThe GlobalStateManagerImplTest was extended to cover the case that a StreamsException is expected when a record is processed that can't be deserialized with the default LogAndFailExceptionHandler.\r\nGlobalStateManagerImplLogAndContinueTest was added and contains one new test which uses the LogAndContinueExceptionHandler and verifies that a record can be ignored during restoration.\r\nCopying all tests is not ideal, but I found no easy way to override the DefaultExceptionHandler just for the one case.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

KAFKA-5503, we have added a check  for `running` flag in the loop inside maybeWaitForProducerId.  This is to handle concurrent call to Sender close(), while we attempt to get the ProducerId.\r\nThis avoids blocking indefinitely when the producer is shutting down.\r\n\r\nThis created a corner case, where Sender thread gets blocked, if we had concurrent producerId reset and call to Sender thread close. The proposed fix is to check the forceClose flag in the loop inside maybeWaitForProducerId. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

segment base offset\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug in log dir reassignment where Partition.maybeReplaceCurrentWithFutureReplica would compare the entire LogEndOffsetMetadata of each replica to determine whether the reassignment has completed. If the active segments of both replicas have different base segments (for example, if the current replica had previously been cleaned and the future replica rolled segments at different points), the reassignment will never complete. The fix is to compare only the LogEndOffsetMetadata.messageOffset for each replica.

See [KIP-440](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-440%3A+Extend+Connect+Converter+to+support+headers), approved.\r\n\r\nExtending `Converter` interface to support headers in backwards-compatible way. Very similar to [Serializer](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/serialization/Serializer.java#L61-L63) and [Deserializer](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/serialization/Deserializer.java) interfaces.\r\n\r\nA few questions I have to the contributors:\r\n- Do I need to update internal components like KafkaStatusBackingStore that use Converters? It doesn't look like they use headers in the moment, so I don't think it's necessary.\r\n- How about other Converter implementations like JsonConverter? Should they all be switched to the new interface method even if they don't use the headers?\r\n- ~~Is KIP required in this case? Converter _is_ a public interface, but the change is trivial and backwards-compatible.~~ Created\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-04T04:35:01Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T06:19:05Z","closed_at":"2019-09-25T16:23:03Z","merged_at":"2019-09-25T16:23:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"70d1bb40d958918ac691ba906a35c4a158815d78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6362/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6362/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6362/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4b91ff4e732275778c44e2649f7c7da5849b6937","head":{"label":"sap1ens:add-headers-to-converters","ref":"add-headers-to-converters","sha":"4b91ff4e732275778c44e2649f7c7da5849b6937","user":{"login":"sap1ens","id":260702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens","html_url":"https://github.com/sap1ens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":173645460,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzM2NDU0NjA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"sap1ens/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sap1ens","id":260702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/260702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens","html_url":"https://github.com/sap1ens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sap1ens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sap1ens/kafka","description":"Mirror

and current replicas segment files have different base offsets\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug in log dir reassignment where Partition.maybeReplaceCurrentWithFutureReplica would compare the entire LogEndOffsetMetadata of each replica to determine whether the reassignment has completed. If the active segments of both replicas have different base segments (for example, if the current replica had previously been cleaned and the future replica rolled segments at different points), the reassignment will never complete. The fix is to compare only the LogEndOffsetMetadata.messageOffset for each replica. Tested with a unit test that simulates the compacted current replica case.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test
