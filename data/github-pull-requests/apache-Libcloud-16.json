patch might look a little \"hackish\", but it has solved the terrible `deploy_node` race condition for me 100%. I've been using libcloud with this patch for a few days with a 100% success rate. It seems that the `timeout` argument for `_ssh_client_connect` is insufficient. In fact, it's set to 300 seconds by default, but the entire operation doesn't take nearly that long to fail, so that timeout must not be the proper thing to fix the `deploy_node` race condition. _This_ fix, however, resolves the issue. 60 seconds is more than enough time to get the SSH key installed onto the node, even with the recent addition of `ssh_alternate_usernames`, which we suspect to be the culprit of this new race condition.\n\nPlease, let me know if there's anything I can do to improve upon this patch and get it merged in. This is really a critical bug that needs to be resolved quickly.\n","created_at":"2014-06-28T18:47:12Z","updated_at":"2014-06-30T17:28:32Z","closed_at":"2014-06-30T11:07:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"48a845e6b223c87ac3d34a01b2e76f10d68175dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/8929c667eb97d7cb17efa5096ae088e2948b9076","head":{"label":"dtgay:fix-deploy-race-condition","ref":"fix-deploy-race-condition","sha":"8929c667eb97d7cb17efa5096ae088e2948b9076","user":{"login":"dtgay","id":1376599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzY1OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1376599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay","html_url":"https://github.com/dtgay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtgay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"b9f9254a3e3bcb687288082137a1244876c247f2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":419555,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTk1NTU=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"apache/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud","description":"Apache

to this fix, a user could call \"get_driver()\" for GCE but authorization was only allowed for the \"compute\" scope.  With the addition of the DNS module, users calling its \"get_driver()\" would only be authorized to the DNS service.\n\nThis change allows scopes to be set as keyword params in get_driver() (or via secrets.py) that get propagated down to the authorization connection class.  The default behavior is to grant authorization via scopes to all supported google services (compute, storage, dns).\n\nIt should be noted that the storage authorization via oauth scopes is bogus, but sets the stage for future enhancements we expect to contribute over the summer.\n\n@wrigri, @franckcuny - A review would be much

was planning to take care of GCE in this first push as well. However, Google presents an interesting challenge with their persistent disk model and their use of the snapshot and image terms. We could use snapshots as a replacement for images. However, this would then limit our ability to use the default images provided by Google. It seems like we actually need a factory for evaluating both the images and snapshots in order to fold in GCE. I completed the _supported_methods_image_management.rst as well in case we want to include it in the documentation. I did submit an email regarding this effort to the dev mail list but I didn't hear anything back so I just went ahead and made the change.
