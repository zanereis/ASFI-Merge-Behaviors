Migrate the SDK to consistently use \"log/slog\" since we've moved to Go 1.21 as base.\r\n* Improve SDK side logging: logs should be emitted to the prism process at least.\r\n  * TODO in separate PR: Check that Prism is outputting to stderr for local Java and Python execution.\r\n  * Improve the format, clarify the log source for SDK logs. Better field grouping.\r\n  * Include SDK sourced Custom Data structured logging fields if present.\r\n* Improve Prism's ability to debug issues in the Docker image\r\n  * Print the Docker log when an unexpected context cancellation occurs.\r\n  * Add new debug print when we're unable to copy the Google Auth file to the container.\r\n* Standalone Prism logging improvements:\r\n * New flag \"log_kind\" which sets the log formatting, to one of \"json\", \"text\", and \"dev\".  \"dev\" is the default.\r\n    * \"dev\" uses the zero dependency \"github.com/golang-cz/devslog\" package to format console logs instead of the default slog behavior.\r\n    * Adds colour and better structure, more suitable for development uses.\r\n * New flag \"debug\" which sets the log level for the Prism binary to Debug, printing all the various debuging prints. Intended for Core SDK developers and  Prism developers.\r\n   * Enables Source file lines for prism locations.\r\n * Improve plumbing of a logger through a job. This work is ongoing, eg. TODO: element manager.\r\n* Various minor improvements to logging messages, to wrap with slog.Attrs to reduce allocations.\r\n\r\nNew Development console logs.\r\n![Screenshot 2024-10-16 4 22 11 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e76114bc-78d0-45b1-b4aa-6e61359499d8)\r\n\r\nSDK side Errors: \r\n![Screenshot 2024-10-16 4 13 51 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51dfc4b5-cd56-48fe-8fdf-a1e53a4d2c4e)\r\n\r\nPrism Debug prints: \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-10-16 4 10 18 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de65b8ec-eae7-4e08-96f8-e3b12f3db6f7)\r\n\r\nExact colours will vary on your Terminal configuration.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

pull request includes changes to the `expand` method in the `sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/core.py` file to simplify the code and remove an unnecessary inner class. The most important changes include the removal of the `MaybeReshuffle` inner class and the restructuring of the `expand` method.\r\n\r\nCode simplification and restructuring:\r\n\r\n* [`sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/core.py`](diffhunk://#diff-d0f4285765492590eff7626123c4dec84a31c45495db77aa1f48153fa97d49ffL3938-R3946): Removed the `MaybeReshuffle` inner class and restructured the `expand` method to directly use `pcol` with `Reshuffle` if necessary.\r\n* [`sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/core.py`](diffhunk://#diff-d0f4285765492590eff7626123c4dec84a31c45495db77aa1f48153fa97d49ffL3938-R3946): Adjusted the return statement in the `expand` method to simplify the pipeline construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

introduced the ability to persist Field descriptions defined in Cross-language transform configs as shown here: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/80c7450f77f58c9e02087cc578ad8abe07648736/sdks/python/apache_beam/typehints/schemas.py#L546-L570\r\n\r\nHowever, this information is dropped when converting the NamedTuple (parsed from the proto) into a `RowTypeConstraint` type.\r\n\r\nThis PR propagates this optional data so that when converting from `RowTypeConstraint` to `schema_pb2.Schema` (runner_api), the field descriptions can be included in the proto.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is also helpful for Beam YAML auto documentation which attempts to use the description field from the `schema_pb2.Schema`, but is not populated by default. After this change, the auto documentation can pull in decsriptions for cross-language (Java) transforms annotated with `@SchemaFieldDescription`\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

and closing Windmill streams are currently via `halfClose()` and on stream creation.  Implementations were previously created and returned in a \"started\" state usually after the stream has already sent the initial headers to open the connection to the backend servers.\r\n\r\nStarting in the current state prevents us from being able to start the stream \"lazily\".  And closing allows other blocking stream operations to prevent streams from being able to be closed (stalling at times up to 10-20 minutes).\r\n\r\n- Add start() flexibility to the WindmillStream API by allowing external callers to start the stream themselves. \r\n- Add shutdown() capability to allow the stream to receive a shutdown signal, that is idempotent and does not block (or is blocked by) other blocking stream operations.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important in direct path mode where the user worker manages the fan out to the backend.\r\n\r\nin terms of implementation, similar to WindmillStream.shutdown(), WindmillStream.start()'s behavior will only execute once during the lifetime of the WindmillStream object. Subsequent calls to start() and shutdown() will do nothing.\r\n\r\nR: @arunpandianp @scwhittle \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

options](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/v2.2.25/gcs/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/hadoop/fs/gcs/GoogleHadoopFileSystemConfiguration.java#L66-L562) specified in my `core-site.xml` file. Particularly, I wanted to turn off [fs.gs.inputstream.fast.fail.on.not.found.enable](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/v2.2.25/gcs/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/hadoop/fs/gcs/GoogleHadoopFileSystemConfiguration.java#L330), which is redundant in a SDF with default empty-match treatment, and tweak [fs.gs.inputstream.fadvise](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/v2.2.25/gcs/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/hadoop/fs/gcs/GoogleHadoopFileSystemConfiguration.java#L350). It looks like these `GoogleCloudStorageReadOptions` options need to be set explicitly in GcsUtil, and passed to any GoogleCloudStorage#open calls (see [reference](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/v2.2.25/gcsio/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/hadoop/gcsio/GoogleCloudStorageImpl.java#L802-L846)).\r\n\r\nThe big downside of this PR is of course, pulling in Hadoop :( The alternative is to manually copy-paste all the Configuration keys manually into `GcsUtil`, which seems harder to maintain. Or, I could omit the `GcsReadOptionsFactory` factory logic entirely and leave it 100% up to the user to construct `GoogleCloudStorageReadOptions` instances.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

implementations were previously created and returned in a \"started\" state usually after the stream has already sent the initial headers to open the connection to the backend servers.\r\n\r\nThis prevents us from being able to start the stream \"lazily\".\r\n\r\nAdd flexibility to the `WindmillStream` API by allowing external callers to start the stream themselves. This is especially important in direct path mode where the user worker manages the fan out to the backend.\r\n\r\nin terms of implementation, similar to `WindmillStream.shutdown()`, `WindmillStream.start()`'s behavior will only execute once during the lifetime of the `WindmillStream` object.  Subsequent calls to `start()` will do nothing.\r\n\r\nbranched off of https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/31902, should be merged after\r\n\r\nchanges to relevant to this PR are in commit https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32763/commits/ec9dd323d1fdef47bb74cab1da55f617bf2a66d2\r\n\r\nR: @scwhittle @arunpandianp \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

automatically infers schema for common Java types: POJOs, JavaBean, AutoValue, AVRO, among others. In addition for it's use with schema transforms, this also provides a simple, efficient way of using these types in PCollections without needing to construct a Coder. A frequent complaint has been that this inference did not work in the presence of generic type parameters. E.g. this means that while Beam can handle PCollections of this class:\r\n\r\n@DefaultSchema(JavaFieldSchema.class)\r\nclass MyType {\r\n   String field1;\r\n}\r\nPCollection<MyType> myTypes = read();\r\n\r\nSchema inference would fail for this:\r\n\r\n@DefaultSchema(JavaFieldSchema.class)\r\nclass MyType\\<T\\> {\r\n   T field1;\r\n}\r\nPCollection<MyType<String>> myTypes = read();\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for generic type parameters to schema inference for common types, addressing the above issue.","created_at":"2024-10-11T18:43:58Z","updated_at":"2024-10-17T13:17:30Z","closed_at":"2024-10-15T21:04:31Z","merged_at":"2024-10-15T21:04:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"a50f91c386c00940b08ef8a5e4d0817422ea230f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842430890,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyNDMwODkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/extensions","name":"extensions","color":"efd739","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1843001093,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQzMDAxMDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/protobuf","name":"protobuf","color":"efd739","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4243601789,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAwi8tc788Dl9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/thrift","name":"thrift","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/32757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/32757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/32757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/be0d49bcc6d5c8f976dca702089df8d824df4bec","head":{"label":"reuvenlax:schema_inference_parameterized_types","ref":"schema_inference_parameterized_types","sha":"be0d49bcc6d5c8f976dca702089df8d824df4bec","user":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72963016,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Mjk2MzAxNg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"reuvenlax/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

get a lot of complaints about all the logging in Beam playground for python examples. It really drowns out any output that might be coming from the examples.\r\n\r\nI attempted to just remove the logging altogether for the python examples here, though I have no way of testing it.\r\n\r\nMy rationale is that the Beam playground environment doesn't really make sense to have logging for. If something goes wrong with an example, it makes a lot more sense to just copy and paste the example into your local Beam environment and debug it there (and optionally turn on logging in your own environment).

is a temporary workaround for BigtableIO.read().\r\nCurrently BigtableIO.read() uses the BoundedSource api, which means that its reader is closed per split. Originally a ref count system was added to allow different reader instances to share the same bigtable client. Unfortunately that system proved to be inadequate - in practice the the readers from multiple threads get closed around the same time.\r\n\r\nThe proper fix for this would be to implement Bigtable.read() as a SplittableDoFn and tie in to the worker lifetime via the Teardown event. However that will be a longer term project. For the short term future, this patch will simply defer the decrementing the refcount by 10 secs, which should prevent the ref count from dropping to zero in between splits.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#30512\r\n\r\n## Problem statement\r\n\r\nRandom tests in this test suite failing due to tmp file get deleted half way, likely a racing condition.\r\n\r\n## Investigation\r\n\r\nThis is a longstanding and tricky issue, see earlier investigation in\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/issues/30512#issuecomment-2402923733\r\n\r\nas the validate runner test set adds//enables more tests, the test becomes increasingly flaky.\r\n\r\n### setDefaultPipelineOptions\r\n\r\nIn TestPipeline scenario, it is found that setDefaultPipelineOptions is called at least twice\r\n\r\n1. When TestPipelineOptions object is created: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/4cf99ea31aa2f3b4e8fa0da479939bbe92bd46dd/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/testing/TestPipeline.java#L518\r\n\r\n2. Right before pipeline runs : https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/4cf99ea31aa2f3b4e8fa0da479939bbe92bd46dd/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/PipelineRunner.java#L47\r\n\r\nNote that if \"options.revision\" does not change, the second call should usually be skipped. However there are multiple place modifying pipeline options before submit (amending some options). Checked that in the first call, revision=2; in the second call, revision=4. Therefore both run resulted in rebuild the map.\r\n\r\nIf run by \"runWithAddidionalArgument\", there is a third call: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/4cf99ea31aa2f3b4e8fa0da479939bbe92bd46dd/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/testing/TestPipeline.java#L376\r\n\r\nThe first run is even triggered when the test is filtered by a wildcard, where junit still runs `@Rule TestPipelineOptions options = TestPipelineOption.create()`\r\n\r\n## Assumptions of what happened\r\n\r\n### Assumption 1\r\n\r\nSpark runner first put jars in a temp directory (`/temp/.../userFiles/...`), load jars into class loader (https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/30512#issuecomment-2402962813), and after pipeline run delete these files (likely in a async way, there is \"shutdown hook called...\" appeared in log)\r\n\r\nAt the same time in tests, setDefaultPipelineOptions are called, invoking ServiceLoader, looking for registered services in the classloader. For PortableSparkRunner tests. It causes racing condition when class loader still has jars entry from previous test that has been deleted.\r\n\r\n### Assumption 2\r\n\r\nExecuting the tests locally (on macOS) there are other intermittent test failure, but now FileNotFoundException has a hint (Too many files open). It could also be that ServiceLoader is opening lots of files if running frequently.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, both observation agrees with excessive call to `setDefaultPipelineOptions` in test pipeline submission time.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR reduces call to `setDefaultPipelineOptions` in two places in TestPipeline.java. This reduces `setDefaultPipelineOptions` call by at least half.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThere is potential risk of FileSystem stored PipelineOptions is out of sync **between TestPipelineOptions.create and testPipeline.run()**. I would argue this is of less concern because\r\n\r\n* TestPipeline / TestPipelineOptions are meant by tests, this change does not affect dev and prod settings.\r\n\r\n* Under current setting out-of-sync can already happen. Consider the following code\r\n\r\n```\r\np1 = TestPipeline.create()\r\n// at this moment, FileSystem's option are set to p1's\r\np2 = TestPipeline.create()\r\n// at this moment, FileSystem's option are set to p2's. Any operation on P1 involving FileSystem will use P2's option\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnder the current implementation of using a Static map for PipelineOption initalized FileSystem, whenever there are multiple pipelines, it can always be out-of-sync.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
