PR adds an option to `kafka.py` to start a separate interbroker listener using the same security protocol as one of the predefined listeners in 'port_mappings' dict.\r\nThis is a first baby-step to properly support named listeners in system tests.\r\n\r\nKafka currently supports named listeners, where you can have two or more listeners with the same security protocol but different names. Current `KafkaService` implementation, however, wouldn't allow that, since listeners in `port_mappings` are keyed by `security_protocol`, so there's 1-1 relationship. Clients use `bootstrap_servers` method which also accepts security_protocol.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a parameter `use_separate_interbroker_listener` to KafkaService constructor as well as adds a `setup_interbroker_listener()` method, which, if provided/invoked, will enable a separate listener in `port_mappings` map, keyed by `INTERBROKER_LISTENER_NAME`. This way client implementations don't need to change and can still pick a port based on security protocol, but underneath there will be an additional port open used exclusively for broker-to-broker communication. This opens up additional scenarios for testing.\r\n\r\nThis change should be backwards compatible - default value for `use_separate_interbroker_listener` is `False`, and I tried to make sure that behavior of `KafkaService` doesn't change when it's `False`. Even when it is `True`, it should not affect behavior of clients, which, as described above, would continue to pick ports based on security_protocol field.\r\n\r\nI intentionally didn't change behavior more than this. We'll work on adding wider support for named listeners, but its better to make smaller incremental changes rather than trying to boil the ocean.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\nUpdated `security_rolling_upgrade_test` to include scenarios when separate interbroker listener is present. Ran these subset of these scenarios locally (didn't run all security_protocol permutations, just some of them) using `ducker-ak`.\r\nRan updated `security_rolling_upgrade_test` in branch builder, all passed:\r\nhttps://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/2713/\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8334\r\n\r\n### Brief Summary:\r\nWe have seen `OffsetCommit` timed out when we do manual offset commit with low traffic.\r\nWhen we append the offset commit to the topic `__consumer_offsets`, the `DelayedProduce` would need to obtain the group metadata in order to complete.\r\nIf the group metadata is obtained by others (such as `HeartBeat`), it would fail and it would only be retried when there is a next `OffsetCommit`\r\n\r\n### Reproduce\r\n#### Methodology\r\n1. DelayedProduce on __consumer_offsets could not be completed if the group.lock is acquired by others\r\n2. We spam requests like Heartbeat to keep acquiring group.lock\r\n3. We keep sending OffsetCommit and check the processing time\r\n\r\n#### Reproduce Script\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/windkit/3384bb86dc146111d1e0857e66b85861\r\n- jammer.py - join the group \"wilson-tester\" and keep spamming Heartbeat\r\n- tester.py - fetch one message and do a long processing (or sleep) and then commit the offset\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-11T13:13:56Z","updated_at":"2024-12-23T03:36:58Z","closed_at":"2024-12-23T03:36:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

adds a new Trogdor fault spec for inducing network latency on a network device for system testing. It operates very similarly to the existing network partition spec by executing the `tc` linux utility. This utility was already available in our Docker image so no change was needed there.\r\n\r\nThe spec JSON looks like:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"class\": \"org.apache.kafka.trogdor.fault.DegradedNetworkFaultSpec\",\r\n  \"startMs\": 0,\r\n  \"durationMs\": 60000,\r\n  \"nodeSpecs\": {\r\n    \"node1\": {\"latencyMs\": 500, \"networkDevice\": \"eth0\"},\r\n    \"node2\": {\"latencyMs\": 400, \"networkDevice\": \"eth0\"},\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe executed command looks like:\r\n```\r\nsudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 100ms 10ms distribution normal\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you find this confounding, you are not alone. Here are some resources I used:\r\n\r\n* https://www.badunetworks.com/traffic-shaping-with-tc/\r\n* https://netbeez.net/blog/how-to-use-the-linux-traffic-control/\r\n* `sudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem help`\r\n\r\nFor now this fault spec targets a specific network device, meaning all inbound and outbound traffic will be subject to the added latency. `tc` also supports more advanced traffic filtering so eventually we could introduce latency for only certain links (like simulating multiple datacenter).","created_at":"2019-06-10T21:51:35Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T15:30:06Z","closed_at":"2019-06-21T15:30:06Z","merged_at":"2019-06-21T15:30:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"d7a5e31ca2f694fe0f5aaf8536ea30400fc19d3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/b1e856baf4397906a3a0c2872c7bfc79410d9202","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-8519","ref":"KAFKA-8519","sha":"b1e856baf4397906a3a0c2872c7bfc79410d9202","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

see the upgrade test failing from time to time. I looked into it and found that the root cause is basically that the test throughput can be too high for the 0.9 producer to make progress. Eventually it reaches a point where it has a huge backlog of timed out requests in the accumulator which all have to be expired. We see a long run of messages like this in the output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"exception\":\"class org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException\",\"time_ms\":1559907386132,\"name\":\"producer_send_error\",\"topic\":\"test_topic\",\"message\":\"Batch Expired\",\"class\":\"class org.apache.kafka.tools.VerifiableProducer\",\"value\":\"335160\",\"key\":null}\r\n{\"exception\":\"class org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException\",\"time_ms\":1559907386132,\"name\":\"producer_send_error\",\"topic\":\"test_topic\",\"message\":\"Batch Expired\",\"class\":\"class org.apache.kafka.tools.VerifiableProducer\",\"value\":\"335163\",\"key\":null}\r\n{\"exception\":\"class org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException\",\"time_ms\":1559907386133,\"name\":\"producer_send_error\",\"topic\":\"test_topic\",\"message\":\"Batch Expired\",\"class\":\"class org.apache.kafka.tools.VerifiableProducer\",\"value\":\"335166\",\"key\":null}\r\n{\"exception\":\"class org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TimeoutException\",\"time_ms\":1559907386133,\"name\":\"producer_send_error\",\"topic\":\"test_topic\",\"message\":\"Batch Expired\",\"class\":\"class org.apache.kafka.tools.VerifiableProducer\",\"value\":\"335169\",\"key\":null}\r\n```\r\nThis can continue for a long time (I have observed up to 1 min) and prevents the producer from successfully writing any new data. While it is busy expiring the batches, no data is getting delivered to the consumer, which causes it to eventually raise a timeout.\r\n```\r\nkafka.consumer.ConsumerTimeoutException\r\nat kafka.consumer.NewShinyConsumer.receive(BaseConsumer.scala:50)\r\nat kafka.tools.ConsoleConsumer$.process(ConsoleConsumer.scala:109)\r\nat kafka.tools.ConsoleConsumer$.run(ConsoleConsumer.scala:69)\r\nat kafka.tools.ConsoleConsumer$.main(ConsoleConsumer.scala:47)\r\nat kafka.tools.ConsoleConsumer.main(ConsoleConsumer.scala)\r\n```\r\nThe fix here is to reduce the throughput, which seems reasonable since the purpose of the test is to verify the upgrade, which does not demand heavy load. Note that I investigated several failing instances of this test going back to 1.0 and saw a similar pattern, so there does not appear to be a regression.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

Should we instantiate a new Log4jController instead of it having static methods? - All operations are stateless, so I thought static methods would do well\r\n3. A logger which does not have a set value returns \"null\" (as seen in the unit tests). Should we just return the Root logger's level?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

PR fixes a blocker issue for static membership. Previously we limit the `member.id` replacement in JoinGroup only when the group is in Stable. This is error-prone and could potentially allow duplicate consumers reading from the same topic, imagine a case where two unknown members join in the `PrepareRebalance` stage at the same time. The PR fixes following things:\r\n\r\n1. Replace `member.id` at any time we see a known static member rejoins group with unknown member.id\r\n2. Immediately fence any ongoing join/sync group callback to early terminate duplicate member\r\n3. Clearly handle Dead/Empty cases as exception\r\n4. Return old leader id upon static member leader rejoin to avoid trivial member assignment being triggered.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-06T22:44:40Z","updated_at":"2019-06-12T15:41:59Z","closed_at":"2019-06-12T15:41:59Z","merged_at":"2019-06-12T15:41:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"e981b82601e9967d3a2492d2cebb45369407b398","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6899/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6899/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6899/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d3d2900439cab3b6134ba74dab5d231c1380edb6","head":{"label":"abbccdda:blocker","ref":"blocker","sha":"d3d2900439cab3b6134ba74dab5d231c1380edb6","user":{"login":"abbccdda","id":5845561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDU1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5845561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda","html_url":"https://github.com/abbccdda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":101105392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDExMDUzOTI=","name":"kafka","full_name":"abbccdda/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abbccdda","id":5845561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDU1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5845561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda","html_url":"https://github.com/abbccdda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abbccdda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abbccdda/kafka","description":"Mirror

The openjdk images have been updated with the same tag, so this can happen suddenly without any other code changes if the new version is pulled.\r\n\r\nThe primary symptom is that ZooKeeper will fail to start due to java not being found when running the system tests in ducker.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows PermitUserEnvironment, and sets the ducker user's `.ssh/environment` to include JAVA_HOME/bin in its path. We cannot set it via the ducker user's `.profile` as ssh commands will not use the

Add onPartitionsLost into the RebalanceListener, which will be triggered when a) reset generations due to errors, and b) topic metadata changed and owned partitions no longer exist.\r\n\r\nWhen resetting generations proactively and subscription changes, we will trigger onPartitionsRevoked instead.\r\n\r\n2. Semantical behavior change: with COOPERATIVE protocol, if the revoked / lost partitions are empty, do not trigger the corresponding callback at all. For added partitions though, even if it is empty we would still trigger the callback as a way to notify the rebalance event; with EAGER protocol, revoked / assigned callbacks are always triggered.\r\n\r\nThe ordering of the callback would be the following:\r\n\r\na. Callback onPartitionsRevoked / onPartitionsLost triggered.\r\nb. Update the assignment (both revoked and added).\r\nc. Callback onPartitionsAssigned triggered.\r\n\r\nIn this way we are assured that users can still access the partitions being revoked, whereas they can also access the partitions being added.\r\n\r\n3. Semantical behavior change (KAFKA-4600): if the rebalance listener throws an exception, pass it along all the way to the `consumer.poll` caller, but still completes the rest of the actions. Also, the newly assigned partitions list does not gets affected with exception thrown since it is just for notifying the users.\r\n\r\n4. Semantical behavior change: the ConsumerCoordinator would not try to modify assignor's returned assignments, instead it will validate that assignments and set the error code accordingly: if there are overlaps between added / revoked partitions, it is a fatal error and would be communicated to all members to stop; if revoked is not empty, it is an error indicate re-join; otherwise, it is normal. \r\n\r\n5. Minor: with the error code removed from the Assignment, ConsumerCoordinator will request re-join if the revoked partitions list is not empty.\r\n\r\n6. Updated ConsumerCoordinatorTest accordingly. Also found a minor bug in MetadataUpdate that removed topic would still be retained with null value of num.partitions.\r\n\r\n7. Updated a few other unit tests that are exposed due to this change.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-05T01:48:10Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T23:58:12Z","closed_at":"2019-08-08T21:31:23Z","merged_at":"2019-08-08T21:31:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"e867a58425876767b952e06892c72b5e13066acc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6884/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6884/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6884/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/6041a792f58b0b9a38983a60e052e9018319a6e6","head":{"label":"guozhangwang:K8179-p3-emigrate-callback","ref":"K8179-p3-emigrate-callback","sha":"6041a792f58b0b9a38983a60e052e9018319a6e6","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39164613,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NDYxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"guozhangwang/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka","description":"Mirror

idempotent producer attempts to detect spurious UNKNOWN_PRODUCER_ID errors and handle them by reassigning sequence numbers to the inflight batches. The inflight batches are tracked in a PriorityQueue. The problem is that the reassignment of sequence numbers depends on the iteration order of PriorityQueue, which does not guarantee any ordering. So this can result in sequence numbers being assigned in the wrong order.  This patch fixes the problem by using a sorted set instead of a priority queue so that the iteration order preserves the sequence order. Note that resetting sequence numbers is an exceptional case.\r\n\r\nThis patch also fixes KAFKA-8484, which can cause an IllegalStateException when the producerId is reset while there are pending produce requests inflight. The solution is to ensure that sequence numbers are only reset if the producerId of a failed batch corresponds to the current producerId.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

predicted by the new incremental cooperative rebalancing protocol, when a worker leaves the group a delay is triggered, controlled by the scheduled.rebalance.max.delay.ms property, during which the tasks detected as lost due to the workers departure are not reassigned. After this delay, workers are joining for another rebalancing round to reschedule the lost tasks. \r\n\r\nSystem tests that perform worker bounces need to account for this delay. \r\nThis PR is also enabled connect system tests on distributed workers for both eager and incremental cooperative rebalancing protocols. \r\n\r\nTested by repeated runs of system tests. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

   When some partiton's replication is assigned to a broker, which disks should these copies be placed on the broker? The original strategy is to allocate according to the number of partiitons, but this will cause a partiton with too many topics to be stored on a disk, which may cause disk hotspot problems.\r\n    In order to solve this problem, we propose an improved strategy: first ensure that the number of partitions of each disk in the topic dimension is even. If the number of partitions of a topic on two disks is equal, then sort according to the total number of partitions on the disk. Select a disk with the least number of partitions to store the current replication.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T09:01:19Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T15:19:50Z","closed_at":"2019-08-01T15:19:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"102ce5fc15b2249d549dc8dc06fd03392137f1d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6866/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/6866/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/6866/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/b03156122502236747bb47f45781e2ad19fb2563","head":{"label":"lordcheng10:replicationStorageStrategyByTopic","ref":"replicationStorageStrategyByTopic","sha":"b03156122502236747bb47f45781e2ad19fb2563","user":{"login":"lordcheng10","id":19296967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjk2OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19296967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10","html_url":"https://github.com/lordcheng10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141949277,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDE5NDkyNzc=","name":"kafka","full_name":"lordcheng10/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lordcheng10","id":19296967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Mjk2OTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19296967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10","html_url":"https://github.com/lordcheng10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lordcheng10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lordcheng10/kafka","description":"Mirror

purpose of this refactor is to provide a cleaner isolation between the follower state machine and the implementation of the follower fetch mechanics (i.e. how to actually retrieve log data). As before, the state machine is implemented in the fetcher thread. This patch adds a new `Fetcher` trait which is implemented by the log dir fetcher and the replica fetcher.
