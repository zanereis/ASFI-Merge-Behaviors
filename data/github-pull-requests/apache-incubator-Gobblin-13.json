I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1054) \"GOBBLIN-1054: Refactor HiveSource to make partition filter extensible\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1054\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Refactor HiveSource to handle different partition filter. \r\n Currently the default partition filter is the LookbackPartitionFilter, this change allows dynamic parition filters through runtime configuration. Added DateRangePartitionFilter along with this PR.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] Added following unit tests\r\nLookbackPartitionFilterGeneratorTest.java\r\nDateRangePartitionFilterGeneratorTest.java \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1052\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCreate a spec consumer path if it does not exist in FS SpecConsumer. This PR also makes the following improvements:\r\n1. FsSpecProducer writes JobSpecs to a tmp location followed by a rename, instead of directly overwriting specs in the final location.\r\n2. Change constructors of FsSpecProducer/FsSpecConsumer to allow passing in a FileSystem object.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nModified existing unit test cases.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-14T23:49:08Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T19:53:47Z","closed_at":"2020-02-24T19:53:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a83d92c7df5af5bb74b9aafcd304c4c373aafc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2892/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2892/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2892/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8ff1b698ec8d64a280ce4e5b12af84195ca191cc","head":{"label":"sv2000:specConsumer","ref":"specConsumer","sha":"8ff1b698ec8d64a280ce4e5b12af84195ca191cc","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1048\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nHelix accesses and sets ZK config overrides (e.g. ZK client session timeout) via Java System properties. This task provides an ability to pass system overrides via Gobblin Cluster application configuration and sets these overrides in the cluster manager and task runners.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit test in HelixUtilsTest.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-12T18:30:53Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T22:45:14Z","closed_at":"2020-02-12T22:45:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a61986cd486b6592fa1f2ecbd3397068c52b391","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2888/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2888/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2888/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/be55b722d775f05873cc7dc9f7b6b20fafc358ec","head":{"label":"sv2000:systemProperties","ref":"systemProperties","sha":"be55b722d775f05873cc7dc9f7b6b20fafc358ec","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\nThe output of Avro2ORC conversion pipeline used to require the output of it to have hard-coded `/final` under the value of `hive.conversion.avro.nestedOrc.destination.dataPath` which is not reasonable.  Adding the fix to make it possible to ignore `/final` in the output. \r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1043\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn Gobblin Helix cluster, we encounter scenarios where a participant continues to work on a Helix partition even after the partition has been assigned by Helix to a different participant leading to duplicate consumption. We implement a check where each Helix task checks if it is indeed the currently assigned participant for the Helix partition. This check is implemented as a CommitStep and can be used as an assertion before data publish occurs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded an integration test. Disabled on Travis since Helix based tests are flaky on Travis.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1038\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nSet default dataset descriptor config for class/platform by including them in each DataNode. For ones like `BaseDataNode` where it doesn't make sense, they are null so there is no default.\r\n\r\nAlso added a check that all dest nodes are the same type of datanode since it wouldn't work anyway for there to be multiple types.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1034\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, the underlying writers are never evicted from the PartitionedDataWriter cache. For long running Gobblin jobs (e.g. streaming), this will cause a memory leak particularly if the underlying writers maintain state. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1032\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nHelix instance tags is useful to target Helix jobs to instances based on user provided tags. In particular, in managed cluster mode where the GobblinAppMaster joins the Helix cluster as a PARTICIPANT, the instance tags allow Helix to exclude the App master from getting tasks assigned. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest deployment.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

The skeleton has many class-definition that have not been open-sourced or only serve Linkedin-specific purpose, the general-purpose job configuration is still under development.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1026\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n  DataPublisher always assume the metadata to be published first. In LinkedIn we had a MultiDataPublisher extend this data publisher, which is used by multiple jobs. Those jobs requires different order of the metadata publishing. Instead of splitting multiDataPublisher into different data publishers and provide override boolean flags, we simply add the configuration to allow user to config the behavior.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1025\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIn SFDC connector, there is a class called `ResultIterator` (refactored to BulkResultIterator and ResultChainingIterator).\r\nIt was using by only PK-Chunking currently. It encapsulated fetching a list of result files to a record iterator.\r\n\r\nHowever, the csvReader.nextRecord() may throw out network IO exception.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1016\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn the managed cluster mode, the Gobblin Yarn Application Master joins Helix cluster in the ADMINISTRATOR role. However, Helix does not support messaging for instances which are not CONTROLLER or PARTICIPANT. To properly handle shutdown and token file update messages, the AppMaster should connect to the Helix cluster as a PARTICIPANT, these message types need to be destined to PARTICIPANT instead of CONTROLLER as is the case today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit tests to YarnAppSecurityManagerTest and GobblinYarnAppLauncherTest classes.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1017\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n- Deprecate `FlowStatus` in favor of `FlowExecution` (since it makes more sense to call delete/update etc. on a flow execution instead of a flow status)\r\n- Create `FlowExecutionResource` and `FlowExecutionClient` with most code shared from the original flow status (get calls still work exactly the same)\r\n- Add a delete endpoint for flow executions which sends a message to the `DagManager` telling it to kill the corresponding flow\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1015\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe current Parquet Writer requires a conversion to a Parquet Group object before writing data to the Parquet file. \r\nSince Parquet libraries natively support writing Avro and Protobuf in-mem formats, we should enable that capability in Gobblin as well. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n* Added support in the SequentialTestSource to generate avro and protobuf records. \r\n* Validated through manual testing that parquet files generated are parseable and using the correct format. \r\n* Added a sample pull file (example-parquet.pull) in the gobblin-examples module that illustrates usage\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1012\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n - A `compactionWatermark` is a timestamp indicating the data we've seen up to that time is compacted. If we explicitly checked that we've seen all the data up to that time, the timestamp would be published also as `completionAndCompactionWatermark`.\r\n - `CompactionWithWatermarkSuite` reports compaction watermarks as part of the compaction pipeline and publishes watermarks as hive table properties\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n - `CompactionWatermarkCheckerTest` covers that compaction watermark time is computed and set to task state correctly\r\n - `CompactionWatermarkActionTest` covers that compaction watermarks are updated in hive table parameters\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1008\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n    * Adds a new module gobblin-parquet-apache (which contains the ParquetWriter with dependencies on org.apache.parquet\r\n    * Adds a new module gobblin-parquet-common (to contain common refactored code for Parquet support without dependencies on any version of Parquet) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  *  No new tests were added, existing tests for gobblin-parquet were copied to gobblin-parquet-apache to support the new version\r\n  * Existing tests were refactored to be more portable (run from IDE, use temporary directories versus test-run directories etc)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1003\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n   HiveDataNode currently extends HdfsDatanode which supports only HDFS URI, this PR is to allow HiveDataNode \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  Test cases are built to test uri validation to true on correct URI and validate for exceptions for invalid URI\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-11T22:32:01Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T01:34:53Z","closed_at":"2019-12-12T01:34:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"676e63ee523e854f6d5c1254e8e4a664f5e37216","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/5f89623265450572b19f47d221258e6caf8eec14","head":{"label":"pawanbtej:newHiveAdlDataNode","ref":"newHiveAdlDataNode","sha":"5f89623265450572b19f47d221258e6caf8eec14","user":{"login":"pawanbtej","id":58757903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzU3OTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58757903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawanbtej","html_url":"https://github.com/pawanbtej","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawanbtej/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawanbtej/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawanbtej/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawanbtej/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawanbtej/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawanbtej/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawanbtej/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawanbtej/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pawanbtej/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2304f11e033febd4ab3389937ef8ff48b27e99ed","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27392543,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM5MjU0Mw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"apache/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin","description":"A

change fixes JsonRecordAvroSchemaToAvroConverter by rejecting Enum\r\nsymbols not defined in the specified Avro schema. Allowing such values\r\ncauses runtime errors when the resulting objects are encoded.\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-987\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n`JsonRecordAvroSchemaToAvroConverter` allows unrecognized Enum symbols not declared in the specified Avro schema. Attempting to write/encode the resulting objects cause runtime errors that are difficult to diagnose or root-cause.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n`org.apache.gobblin.converter.avro.JsonRecordAvroSchemaToAvroConverterTest.testConverterThrowsOnUnrecognizedEnumSymbols()`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-983\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThere is a dependency on javafx. Javafx is usually used for building desktop applications, so the package is not included on some versions of java that run on servers, such as the Docker container. Since this is just string formatting we can replace it with Java's library\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n1 line change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-982] Dependencies missing for running JDBC extraction job\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-982\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nAdd \"gobblin-sql\" module into distribution dependencies so that it could be packaged into built tarball, otherwise while running JDBC extraction job, it will pop up `ClassNotFound` exception for all \"gobblin-sql\" classes.\r\n\r\nAdd jdbc related libraries into mr libs as jdbc extraction codes are actually running on mappers and need these dependencies (same as above got `ClassNotFound` exception otherwise).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nGradle config and shell scripts modification.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-980\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n`CancelFlowCallable` returns an `AzkabanSuccess`, which fails the equals check, causing it to throw an exception even though cancel was successful. This changes it to instead use `isAssignableFrom` to allow subclasses as well. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTrivial change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-978\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrent implementation uses flow start time instead of job start time to determine if a job has been stuck in the ORCHESTRATED state. This can incorrectly cancel jobs prematurely. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nModified unit tests. End to end test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-971\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] \r\nProblem: \r\nWhen speculative execution is enabled with ERR_FILE set as the policy when encountering records that failed rowPolicy, we will run into HDFS file lease contention since the file name are only depends on `state.getId()`. \r\n\r\nSolution: To maintain backward-compatibility we allow speculative-execution to happen by default, but whenever the policy is set to `ERR_FILE` , we created different file name for speculative execution. This won't guarantee contention-free as different execution environment could coincidentally give identical timestamp, but the chances are pretty low. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-963] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-963\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently in GobblinMultiTaskAttempt, when we call createTaskRunnable, we rely on a TaskFactory to create a task and return a wrapper for that task. However, when we create the wrapper, we initialized the TaskContext twice. \r\n\r\nFor the task creation\r\nFor the task wrapper creation\r\nThese two TaskContexts, which generate two copies of TaskState, will cause inconsistency in the following operation. The task state update within the task won't be reflected in TaskWrapper.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this is the buggy line of code\r\n```java\r\nreturn new TaskIFaceWrapper(taskFactoryOpt.get().createTask(new TaskContext(workUnitState)),\r\n new TaskContext(workUnitState), countDownLatch, this.taskStateTracker);\r\n```\r\nIdeally, we should create the TaskContext once, and reuse the same TaskContext.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-966\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen no partitions are processed by KafkaExtractor, the currentPartitionIndex remains at -1. Calling the KafkaExtractorStatsTracker#updateStatisticsForCurrentPartition() method, with a partition index of -1 causes ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTrivial.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-954] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-954\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n1. Added logic to support swapping of different implementations of HiveRegistrationPublisher in HiveRegTaskStateCollectorServiceHandlerImpl\r\n2. Added \"data.publisher.latest.file.arrival.timestamp\" as current time in millis whenever a task finishes\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nCode already covered by test cases TaskStateCollectorServiceTest\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-953\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nModify `GobblinServiceManager` to use config with a certain prefix for creating a `ServiceBasedAppLauncher` (with a fallback of normal config). This allows setting config for GaaS without unintentionally adding that config to orchestrated jobs as well. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-950\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThe dag only needs to be persisted when being added by `Orchestrator`, but right now it also is persisted when being loaded from store on GaaS restart (even though it won't have changed). This PR removes the unnecessary persist there.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested locally\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not
