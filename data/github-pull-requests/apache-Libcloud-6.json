Update Azure Blob Storage API version to 2016-05-31\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTo enable the Azure Blobs driver to upload larger files, this pull request updates the blob storage API version used by the driver to [2016-05-31](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/version-2016-05-31) which raised the size of block blobs that can be uploaded in a single request to 100MB.\r\n\r\nTo leverage the full capacity of the new storage API version, the maximum block size in the Azure Blobs driver is also increased to 100MB. A code comment from 2013 cautioned about Azure instability on requests over 4MB, however, I haven't seen any stability issues with this change during over 200 runs of the integration tests using file uploads ranging from 4MB to 100MB.\r\n\r\nGiven that the Azure Blobs driver currently does not support chunked upload, increasing the maximum upload size seems to me like a pragmatic fix to expand the driver's functionality until a more comprehensive refactor can be made to re-instate the block-list workflow.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code

Fix hash validation with stream uploads\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nBug fix for cloudfiles upload_object_via_stream() erroneously throwing a hash mismatch when using a file handle as the iterator. Example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom libcloud.storage.providers import get_driver\r\nfrom libcloud.storage.types import ObjectDoesNotExistError\r\n\r\ndriver = get_driver('cloudfiles')\r\ndriver = driver('user', 'key')\r\ncontainer = driver.get_container(container_name='test')\r\nwith open('/tmp/test.file', 'w') as fh:\r\n    fh.write('test')\r\nwith open('/tmp/test.file') as fh:\r\n    driver.upload_object_via_stream(iterator=fh, container=container, object_name='test.file')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would result in the exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibcloud.storage.types.ObjectHashMismatchError: <ObjectHashMismatchError in <libcloud.storage.drivers.cloudfiles.CloudFilesStorageDriver object at 0x103f43d68>, value=MD5 hash checksum does not match (expected=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e, actual=098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6), object = test.file>\r\n```\r\n\r\nd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e is the hash for an empty file. The problem is the upload happens before the hash is calculated and the file handle is read to the EOF. The fix is to seek the file handle to the beginning before feeding it into the hash function.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\ndone, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that

Fix proxy_url support in CloudFiles\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI ran into a couple issues when trying to use the cloudfiles driver behind an HTTP proxy. \r\n\r\n* libcloud was not configuring the requests library proxy settings correctly.\r\n* The cloudfiles driver was not passing the proxy into the identity connection.\r\n* The proxy documentation was referencing the wrong argument name.\r\n\r\nThis PR closes these issues, but there may be other related issues in other drivers.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nDone, ready for review. This could probably use some additional tests, and a review of other code for similar bugs. It looks like 2.5.1 has other proxy changes, so I wanted to get the PR in sooner rather than later and kept it simple.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

Add Gandi LiveDNS driver\r\n\r\n[Gandi](https://gandi.net) released an API for their DNS service completely different from their previous XMLRPC implementation.  This contribution adds a driver to cover the new service, per [LIBCLOUD-949](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-949).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a new driver and does not touch on any of the previous Gandi XMLRPC driver code.  The implementation is similar to other providers that use HTTP and JSON.\r\n\r\nGandi's [documentation](https://doc.livedns.gandi.net/) is the overall basis for the implementation though there are some minor discrepancies in it that don't match up to usage experience.  They also left out any documentation of errors.\r\n\r\nOne point of possible confusion is that zones and domains are separate classes in this service, which enables reuse of one zone file for multiple domains but becomes somewhat difficult to shoehorn into Libcloud's classes, especially since what's referred to as a Libcloud zone corresponds to a Gandi domain, and nothing really corresponds to a Gandi zone.  There is precedence since this is also true of the existing Gandi XMLRPC implementation, which appears to me to have chosen to go with ignoring Gandi zones as much as possible in favor of domains.  The new Gandi API does allow for this (actions taken on a domain will apply to the zone and all related domains behind the scenes), but it means things like `delete_zone` and `update_zone` have no real meaning - one cannot delete a Gandi domain from the API, and it is basically immutable if ignoring Gandi zones - so I didn't implement those methods.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nDone, ready for

testing Gridscale drivers I noticed some issues which I originally missed during the code review.\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes some of those issues and implements some new functionality for the completeness sake.\r\n\r\n1. Add missing ``encode_data()`` method on the Connection class and rely on that for encoding request body (data) instead of doing it manually instead the driver methods.\r\n\r\n   This way it follows Libcloud API which means it works correctly with logging connection and other abstractions.\r\n\r\n2. Implement ``import_key_pair_from_string`` / ``import_key_pair_from_file`` method.\r\n\r\n3. Add new ``ex_list_volumes_for_node`` and ``ex_list_ips_for_node`` methods and ability to delete associated resources when destroying a node\r\n\r\n4. Support for ``deploy_node()`` functionality. Needed various improvements in the non-driver code.\r\n\r\n5. Add some tests which were missing and make some of the existing tests more robust / strict by also checking HTTP method name inside the mock response class.\r\n\r\n6. Some small bug fixes in the driver.","created_at":"2019-07-17T09:43:26Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T20:50:00Z","closed_at":"2019-07-17T20:50:00Z","merged_at":"2019-07-17T20:50:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"e7f6399ce1eb82aeec358b728ef88265cd432a15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1394383433,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzk0MzgzNDMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute","name":"api: compute","color":"ffbac7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1438686174,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDM4Njg2MTc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/drivers:%20gridscale","name":"drivers: gridscale","color":"8fe87d","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1443523377,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQzNTIzMzc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/api:%20compute:%20ssh","name":"api: compute: ssh","color":"93e276","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1315/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1315/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1315/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/7dce9bcdfeb4c01cf6cc31ff25ff2d7538770069","head":{"label":"Kami:gridscale_driver_improvements","ref":"gridscale_driver_improvements","sha":"7dce9bcdfeb4c01cf6cc31ff25ff2d7538770069","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

special, because it's dynamically assigned during run-time inside the driver constructor based on the value of ``connectionCls`` driver class attribute. As such, pylint is not aware of it.\r\n\r\nThe changes already exposed some actual issues in the code (bad / incorrect multiple inheritance, referencing invalid variables, etc.).\r\n\r\nSadly not all of those things can be fixed easily so I needed to fall back to ``# pylint: disable`` in some scenarios.","created_at":"2019-07-10T15:22:28Z","updated_at":"2019-07-10T17:54:35Z","closed_at":"2019-07-10T17:54:35Z","merged_at":"2019-07-10T17:54:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"23838331aa8815d842e5f62fed9356f36f4d43a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1445097435,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDQ1MDk3NDM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/labels/pylint","name":"pylint","color":"f7f57e","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1308/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1308/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1308/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/aeaeec88fa19e3ec9c6e72c944e53b48be764fae","head":{"label":"Kami:pylint_improvements","ref":"pylint_improvements","sha":"aeaeec88fa19e3ec9c6e72c944e53b48be764fae","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

ec2 list_volumes should accept more filters\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nEC2 API requests are throttled which sometimes requires the API requests to be more fine tuned to avoid having to get back large amounts of responses. For more information, see this [the AWS API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/query-api-troubleshooting.html#api-request-rate).\r\n\r\nThis change adds the ability to pass more filters to the EC2 DescribeVolumes call, the filter needs to be a dictionary of filter name and value pairs as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeVolumes.html).\r\n\r\nI had 2 options here:\r\n1. Remove the `node` parameter from this call and ensure that the caller passes in the node ID as part of the `filters` dict.\r\n2. Add a new parameter `filters` and leave the `node` parameter as it is in order to preserve the original method signature.\r\n\r\nI chose the latter only for the reason that it preserves the original method signature.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- [x]

Fix azure_blobs driver with BlobStorage account\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs discussed in [LIBCLOUD-851](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-851), the Azure Storage driver currently doesn't work when used against a storage account that was created using `kind=BlobStorage` ([see failed integration test](https://clewolff.visualstudio.com/libcloud-tests/_build/results?buildId=71)). This is because BlobStorage accounts only work with API version `2014-02-14` or newer ([see docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/versioning-for-the-azure-storage-services)). Updating the API version fixes the problem and doesn't affect the other types of storage accounts ([see passed integration test](https://clewolff.visualstudio.com/libcloud-tests/_build/results?buildId=76)).\r\n\r\nNote that this pull request is based on the work of @daviskirk in https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/1202.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n- [CI passed](https://travis-ci.org/CatalystCode/libcloud/builds/539805150)\r\n\r\n### Checklist

Update Cloudflare DNS driver to API v4\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs discussed in [LIBCLOUD-1001](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-1001), Cloudflare turned off [the old JSON API](https://www.cloudflare.com/api_json.html) and replaced it with [the new v4 API](https://api.cloudflare.com/). This pull request updates the Cloudflare DNS driver to use the new API.\r\n\r\nNote that in order to keep the implementation of the v4 driver streamlined, none of the existing `ex_` methods were migrated to the new API.\r\n\r\nNote that [LIBCLOUD-994](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-994) is also fixed by the new driver implementation.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for

pull request fixes various issues in the code which were mostly identified when running tests under newer versions of Python 3 (newer versions print various deprecation warning and also report open file handle leakage, etc.).\r\n\r\n1. Fix various tests and drivers which didn't correctly cleanup and close open files\r\n2. Fix ``libcloud.enable_debug`` debug function so it correctly closes the file handle on exit\r\n3. Update test code to use non-deprecated assertion methods on newer versions of Python 3\r\n4. Various other deprecation errors\r\n5. Ignore user warnings when running tests using tox (this way we silence non-important warnings)\r\n6. Update various tests to use smaller sleep / poll intervals to speed tests up (tests now finish ~40 seconds or so faster)\r\n7. Update py.test config so it prints 10 slowest tests at the end of the test run report. This will allow us to identify and fix slow tests in the future.","created_at":"2019-05-28T15:38:19Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T18:44:17Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T18:44:16Z","merged_at":"2019-05-28T18:44:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"b23b236c3247a632572b00953666f6c2c3da079f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1290/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1290/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1290/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/5b0b64aae6dc4d45cc405dc055e6da2d850dad37","head":{"label":"Kami:test_warning_fixes","ref":"test_warning_fixes","sha":"5b0b64aae6dc4d45cc405dc055e6da2d850dad37","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

Fix Azure upload_object_via_stream used with iter\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs described in [LIBCLOUD-1043](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-1043), the Azure Blob Storage driver currently doesn't support use-cases like this:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndriver.upload_object_via_stream(iter(something), ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that the current implementation of `upload_object_via_stream` assumes that the passed-in iterator always implements `seek`. This pull request adds a fallback for iterators where this is not the case.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

Scaleway driver fixes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes several problems that blocked Scaleway driver from using in the wild, namely:\r\n1. Rewritten Request logic in such a way that it reconnects after host is changed. In present, if host variable changes to None, connection is not re-established, leading to crash after the following code:\r\n```\r\ndriver = ScalewayNodeDriver(key=XXX, secret=XXX)\r\nkeys = driver.list_key_pairs()\r\nservers = driver.list_servers()  \r\n```\r\n2. Implemented the code to get the organization from the API, as organization and key are two different entities\r\n3. Implemented region choice at Driver level\r\n4. Implemeted get_key_pair method\r\n \r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [X] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [ ]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-1039?\r\n\r\nWhen downloading an object as a stream `download_object_as_stream`\r\nin storage/drivers/cloudfiles.py a generator object should be\r\nreturned. Currently a rerquest/response object is returned\r\nresulting in a HttpLibResponseProxy error.\r\n\r\nThis commit alters the callback_kwargs to use a\r\nrequests/response.iter_content resulting in an actual iterator\r\nbeing returned. This code change is in other storage/driver \r\nspecific code and appears to have been missed in cloudfiles.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything

Add Azurite support for Azure Blob Storage driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs described in [LIBCLOUD-1037](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-1037), the Azure Blob Storage driver currently doesn't support the [Azurite storage emulator](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite) or [Blob Storage on IoT edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-store-data-blob).\r\n\r\nThis pull request made the changes required to support these two variants of Azure Blob Storage:\r\n\r\n- Protect against a missing content md5 since the Azurite emulator doesn't set this value.\r\n\r\n- Protect against a missing metadata section since the Azurite emulator doesn't set this value.\r\n\r\n- Implement routing to a specific account via URL prefix (e.g. /someaccount) instead of hostname (e.g. someaccount.blob.core.windows.net).\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n###

Override the auth header for the VCloud 5.5 Connection\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNewer VCD installs (I'm working against API level 30.0, for reference) enforce a minimum API level on authentication. This simply causes the authentication payload to send a version 5.5 header rather than a version 1.5 header, so our auth request isn't rejected.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\ndone, ready for

incorrect firewall direction check for allow/deny rules.\r\n\r\nOnly default source_ranges to 0.0.0.0/0 if direction is INGRESS.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes for GCENodeDriver.ex_create_firewall()\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFixed two small bugs in GCENodeDriver.ex_create_firewall().\r\n\r\nThe first issue was that a direction check was being applied to determine whether allowed or denied would be passed to the GCE API call. Both ingress and egress rules can have allowed or denied blocks so this shouldn't be conditional on the direction.\r\n\r\nThe second issue was that source_ranges was automatically set to [0.0.0.0/0] if no other source filters were applied. Since source filters are invalid for egress rules, I added a check for the INGRESS direction prior to setting a default source range.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\ndone, ready for review\r\n\r\n###
