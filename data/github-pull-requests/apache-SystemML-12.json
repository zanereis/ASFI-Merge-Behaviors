adds the shuffle data partitioner the the federated parameter server and a helpful way of running federated unit tests. See federatedBalancedAndWriteWithMTD in the AutomatedTestBase. \r\n\r\nThe federated parameter server unit test was optimised and the scripts TwoNN.dml and CNN.dml updated.\r\n\r\nAlso .getFedMapping() of FederationMap was refactored to getFRangeFDataMap to avoid confusion with the method of MatrixObject with the same name.\r\n\r\n**Current issues/ questions?**\r\n\r\n- The hybrid federated parameter server unit tests fail stating \"Shuffle\" scheme is not supported. This is because the read somehow pulls in the matrix and presents it as a dense block. This means the parameter server is running in regular mode thus failing on the shuffle scheme.\r\n\r\n- The federated parameter server unit test input directory is currently not cleaned up. Should this be done after every run?\r\n\r\n- How to generate the ID of a newly created FederationMap correctly?

[SYSTEMDS-2686] Compressed overlapping column groups\r\n\r\nThis commit change the compressed right multiplication to perform in\r\ncompressed space, resulting in significantly faster execution.\r\nThe technique employed results in overlapping column groups, that contain\r\npartial results of the matrix multiplication.\r\nThe downside is that some operations that previously was possible on\r\ncompressed space no longer works, for the overlapping column groups.\r\n\r\nTo still support all the operations, then decompression is used for\r\ncases where it is impossible to execute on the compressed matrices.\r\n\r\nAnother addition is that statistics now contain compression and\r\ndecompression times if compression is enabled.","created_at":"2020-10-18T17:28:15Z","updated_at":"2020-10-19T13:18:18Z","closed_at":"2020-10-19T09:36:01Z","merged_at":"2020-10-19T09:36:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"472d778b4c0713b6df6b3a10bcfd7475ef167cc8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/472d778b4c0713b6df6b3a10bcfd7475ef167cc8","head":{"label":"Baunsgaard:C-MMR","ref":"C-MMR","sha":"472d778b4c0713b6df6b3a10bcfd7475ef167cc8","user":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":250787012,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTA3ODcwMTI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"Baunsgaard/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Baunsgaard","id":9947148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDcxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard","html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Baunsgaard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Baunsgaard/systemds","description":"Mirror

a federated input Matrix is passed to the parameter server builtin instruction, the parameter server will detect it. \r\n\r\n**Data Partitioning**\r\nfor now only row federated matrices are supported. The federated data partitioner extracts the information about the workers.\r\n**Setup**\r\nThe setup is handled by a \"User Defined Function\" (UDF). To send all necessary data (model, gradient and aggregation functions) to the federated worker it was required to serialise ListObjects and parts of the program. As the parameter server uses unoptimised functions, it was further necessary to extend the program serialisation functionality of the ProgramConverter.\r\n**Training**\r\nThere are two different update types and frequencies for the federated workers. Updates are possible \"batch synchronised\" or \"asynchronous\". An update can be sent each batch or epoch. Each computation of an update is handled by a UDF which is sent along with the current model. In the epoch case, the federated worker can also use the aggregation function to update its local model.\r\n**Cleanup**\r\nMost cleanup is done on the fly and making sure to clear the caches for \"Cacheable Objects\". After the federated worker completes its task, a \"teardown UDF\" is sent to restore the execution context to the state before the computations.\r\n**Testing**\r\nThe included test case, tests all different supported parameter combinations on a randomly generated \"dummy MNIST\" dataset.\r\n\r\n**Problems**\r\nAt the moment the tests only work for the Exec Mode \"Single Node\". To fix this the program is recompiled on call of the parameter server builtin instruction, but this process creates invalid CP°rmvar instructions when passing SPARK instructions\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-01T11:19:16Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T18:55:32Z","closed_at":"2020-10-30T18:55:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e92abd0d252f97e47789211e7c393ee743b4cf4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1075/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1075/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1075/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/34a228bb9ffe3569368c51de01b084b01ef85482","head":{"label":"tobiasrieger:federated_paramserv","ref":"federated_paramserv","sha":"34a228bb9ffe3569368c51de01b084b01ef85482","user":{"login":"tobiasrieger","id":39962737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTYyNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39962737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger","html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasrieger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":284739507,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODQ3Mzk1MDc=","name":"systemds","full_name":"tobiasrieger/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tobiasrieger","id":39962737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTYyNzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39962737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger","html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasrieger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobiasrieger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tobiasrieger/systemds","description":"Mirror

PR improves propagation of fine-grained privacy constraints for matrix multiplications. The PR also provides a new structure for fine-grained privacy propagations by introducing a \"Propagator\" interface which are implemented by different propagator classes. This interface will be used in the following implementations of privacy propagation for other operators. \r\n\r\nThe new matrix multiplication propagation is more efficient than the previous implementation since it makes an array with the summarized privacy level of the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second matrix. \r\nFurthermore, it takes the operator type into account. This means that if a row or column contains only a single non-zero value, it cannot be considered an aggregation, hence the output in case of the PrivateAggregation privacy level in the input should still be PrivateAggregation. \r\nThe rules of propagation is implemented in the method \"PrivacyPropagator.corePropagation\", where the comment also details the privacy \"truth table\".","created_at":"2020-09-21T10:55:09Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T10:09:48Z","closed_at":"2020-09-29T12:29:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5111f84ed80ca5adc70f9f25d0f33d8c2fc062db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1060/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1060/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1060/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/fa1401879d69d20596f154413d9a71e059b69823","head":{"label":"sebwrede:FineGrainedPropagationMult","ref":"FineGrainedPropagationMult","sha":"fa1401879d69d20596f154413d9a71e059b69823","user":{"login":"sebwrede","id":32260341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjYwMzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32260341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede","html_url":"https://github.com/sebwrede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":257653602,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTc2NTM2MDI=","name":"systemds","full_name":"sebwrede/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sebwrede","id":32260341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjYwMzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32260341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede","html_url":"https://github.com/sebwrede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebwrede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sebwrede/systemds","description":"Mirror

patch fixes two major issues of request interference from multiple\r\ncoordinator threads.\r\n\r\nFirst, we now properly maintain separate execution context at the\r\nfederated site for different request streams from parfor workers which\r\notherwise could interfer (e.g., on rmvar instructions for shared input\r\nvariables)\r\n\r\nSecond, even within a stream federated requests (e.g., execute and\r\ncleanup) could out output each other if there are no data dependencies\r\nor synchronization between them. We now added barriers for federated\r\nrequests wherever this was necessary.\r\n\r\nLast, this patch also fixes unnecessary warning messages of the parfor\r\noptimizer, specifically in a setting with forced singlenode execution.","created_at":"2020-08-18T17:28:26Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T18:13:52Z","closed_at":"2020-08-18T18:13:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6ea8ec29a9f531bdb24a2e53918ec34d961abb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1028/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/1028/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/1028/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/cd3fdca2c936053cb10314c8637c7ac965596ba2","head":{"label":"mboehm7:fed_parfor","ref":"fed_parfor","sha":"cd3fdca2c936053cb10314c8637c7ac965596ba2","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":288460406,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODg0NjA0MDY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"mboehm7/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7/systemds","description":"Mirror
