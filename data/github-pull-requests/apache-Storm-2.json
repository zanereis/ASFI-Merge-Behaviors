What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixes STORM-4104 to improve the stability of Pacemaker server (and Netty Server in Workers) bringing it closer to the stability it had in Storm1. This is done by changing the behaviour of Utils.handleUncaughtException to also swallow exceptions derived from those in the supplied ALLOWED_EXCEPTIONS list instead of only the exact exceptions defined in there (i.e. instead of only 'swallowing' IOException, this change will allow SocketException (derived from IOException) to also be 'swallowed')\r\n\r\n## How was the change tested\r\n\r\nBefore this change it is easy to see Pacemaker server shut down when simply killing a topology:\r\n2024-11-06 15:21:13.251 [o.a.s.m.n.StormServerHandler] ERROR: server errors in handling

Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>OPTIONS file to be loaded by remote worker is now preserved so that it does not get purged by the primary host. A similar technique as how we are preserving new SST files from getting purged is used for this. min_options_file_numbers_ is tracked like pending_outputs_ is tracked.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>9.7.2 (10/08/2024)</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a bug for surfacing write unix time: <code>Iterator::GetProperty(&quot;rocksdb.iterator.write-time&quot;)</code> for non-L0 files.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>9.7.1 (09/26/2024)</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Several DB option settings could be lost through <code>GetOptionsFromString()</code>, possibly elsewhere as well. Affected options, now fixed:<code>background_close_inactive_wals</code>, <code>write_dbid_to_manifest</code>, <code>write_identity_file</code>, <code>prefix_seek_opt_in_only</code></li>\n<li>Fix under counting of allocated memory in the compressed secondary cache due to looking at the compressed block size rather than the actual memory allocated, which could be larger due to internal fragmentation.</li>\n<li>Skip insertion of compressed blocks in the secondary cache if the lowest_used_cache_tier DB option is kVolatileTier.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>9.7.0 (09/20/2024)</h2>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Make Cache a customizable class that can be instantiated by the object registry.</li>\n<li>Add new option <code>prefix_seek_opt_in_only</code> that makes iterators generally safer when you might set a <code>prefix_extractor</code>. When <code>prefix_seek_opt_in_only=true</code>, which is expected to be the future default, prefix seek is only used when <code>prefix_same_as_start</code> or <code>auto_prefix_mode</code> are set. Also, <code>prefix_same_as_start</code> and <code>auto_prefix_mode</code> now allow prefix filtering even with <code>total_order_seek=true</code>.</li>\n<li>Add a new table property &quot;rocksdb.key.largest.seqno&quot; which records the largest sequence number of all keys in file. It is verified to be zero during SST file ingestion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the semantics of the BlobDB configuration option <code>blob_garbage_collection_force_threshold</code> to define a threshold for the overall garbage ratio of all blob files currently eligible for garbage collection (according to <code>blob_garbage_collection_age_cutoff</code>). This can provide better control over space amplification at the cost of slightly higher write amplification.</li>\n<li>Set <code>write_dbid_to_manifest=true</code> by default. This means DB ID will now be preserved through backups, checkpoints, etc. by default. Also add <code>write_identity_file</code> option which can be set to false for anticipated future behavior.</li>\n<li>In FIFO compaction, compactions for changing file temperature (configured by option <code>file_temperature_age_thresholds</code>) will compact one file at a time, instead of merging multiple eligible file together (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/13018\">#13018</a>).</li>\n<li>Support ingesting db generated files using hard link, i.e. IngestExternalFileOptions::move_files/link_files and IngestExternalFileOptions::allow_db_generated_files.</li>\n<li>Add a new file ingestion option <code>IngestExternalFileOptions::link_files</code> to hard link input files and preserve original files links after ingestion.</li>\n<li>DB::Close now untracks files in SstFileManager, making avaialble any space used\nby them.

Previously, prefix seek could mix different prefix interpretations between memtable and SST files. Now the latest <code>prefix_extractor</code> at the time of iterator creation or refresh is respected.</li>\n<li>Fix a bug with manual_wal_flush and auto error recovery from WAL failure that may cause CFs to be inconsistent (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/12995\">#12995</a>).

We now use compensated file size (tombstones are assigned some value size) when calculating L0 size and reduce the threshold for L0 size limit. This is to avoid accumulating too much data/tombstones in L0.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>*Make DestroyDB supports slow deletion when it's configured in <code>SstFileManager</code>. The slow deletion is subject to the configured <code>rate_bytes_per_sec</code>, but not subject to the <code>max_trash_db_ratio</code>.</li>\n<li>Fixed a bug where we set unprep_seqs_ even when WriteImpl() fails.

[org.clojure:clojure](https://github.com/clojure/clojure) from 1.11.2 to 1.12.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/changes.md\">org.clojure:clojure's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Changes to Clojure in Version 1.12.0</h1>\n<h2>1 Compatibility</h2>\n<h3>1.1 Java 8 - Compatiblity EOL notice</h3>\n<p>Clojure 1.12 produces Java 8 bytecode (same as Clojure 1.10 and 1.11), but this is expected to be the last release using a Java 8 baseline. Future releases will move the bytecode and minimum Java compatibility to a newer Java LTS release.</p>\n<h3>1.2 Java 21 - Virtual thread pinning from user code under <code>synchronized</code></h3>\n<p>Clojure users want to use virtual threads on JDK 21. Prior to 1.12, Clojure lazy-seqs and delays, in order to enforce run-once behavior, ran user code under synchronized blocks, which as of JDK 21 don't yet participate in cooperative blocking. Thus if that code did e.g. blocking I/O it would pin a real thread. JDK 21 may emit warnings for this when using <code>-Djdk.tracePinnedThreads=full</code>.</p>\n<p>To avoid this pinning, in 1.12 <code>lazy-seq</code> and <code>delay</code> use locks instead of synchronized blocks.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2804\">CLJ-2804</a></p>\n<h3>1.3 Security</h3>\n<p>Fix <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22871\">CVE-2024-22871</a> detailed in <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vr64-r9qj-h27f\">GHSA-vr64-r9qj-h27f</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2839\">CLJ-2839</a> <code>iterate</code>, <code>cycle</code>, <code>repeat</code> - infinite seqs have infinite <code>hashCode()</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.4 Serialization</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1327\">CLJ-1327</a> explicitly sets the Java serialization identifier for the classes in Clojure that implement Java serialization. In Clojure 1.11.0 this changed for two classes unnecessarily and we reverted those changes in Clojure 1.11.1 - this completes that work for the rest of the classes.</p>\n<p>Clojure data types have implemented the Java serialization interfaces since Clojure 1.0. Java serialization is designed to save graphs of Java instances into a byte stream. Every class has an identifier (the serialVersionUID) that is automatically generated based on the class name, it's type hierarchy, and the serialized fields. At deserialization time, deserialization can only occur when the available class has an identifier that matches the class id recorded in the serialized bytes.</p>\n<p>Clojure has never provided a guarantee of serialization consistency across Clojure versions, but we do not wish to break compatibility any more than necessary and these changes will give us more control over that in the future.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1327\">CLJ-1327</a></p>\n<h3>1.5 Dependencies</h3>\n<p>Updated dependencies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>spec.alpha dependency to 0.5.238 - <a href=\"https://github.com/clojure/spec.alpha/blob/master/CHANGES.md\">changes</a></li>\n<li>core.specs.alpha dependency to 0.4.74 - <a href=\"https://github.com/clojure/core.specs.alpha/blob/master/CHANGES.md\">changes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2852\">CLJ-2852</a></p>\n<h2>2 Features</h2>\n<h3>2.1 Add libraries for interactive use</h3>\n<p>There are many development-time cases where it would be useful to add a library interactively without restarting the JVM - speculative evaluation, adding a known dependency to your project, or adding a library to accomplish a specific task.</p>\n<p>Clojure now provides new functions to add libraries interactively, without restarting the JVM or losing the state of your work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://clojure.github.io/clojure/branch-master/clojure.repl-api.html#clojure.repl.deps/add-lib\">add-lib</a> takes a lib that is not available on the classpath, and makes it available by downloading (if necessary) and adding to the classloader. Libs already on the classpath are not updated. If the coordinate is not provided, the newest Maven or git (if the library has an inferred git repo name) version or tag are used.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[Issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-4085)\r\n\r\nThe AsyncLocalizer class contains a scheduler that continuously performs downloadOrUpdate operations on blobs. Currently, if an exception occurs during this update process, the exception is not properly handled, causing the thread to terminate.\r\nAs a result, workers are unable to update blobs because the threads have been killed. The only way to recover from this is by restarting the supervisor.\r\n\r\nThis fix ensures that exceptions are properly handled, preventing workers from getting stuck while updating blobs.\r\n\r\n## How was the change tested\r\n\r\nAfter a few leadership changes, the worker threads for updating blobs are killed.  On my tests, I forced leadership changes and ensure that the threads are not being killed due to

[org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-bom](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2) from 2.23.0 to 2.24.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/releases\">org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-bom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>2.24.1</h2>\n<p>This release contains mainly bug fixes of problems encountered with the thread context map, logger registry and configuration reloading.</p>\n<p>It also enhances integration tests to use Docker images of the most recent releases of MongoDB and Elastic Search.</p>\n<h3>Changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Rework <code>LoggerRegistry</code> to make it <code>MessageFactory</code>-namespaced.\nThis effectively allows loggers of same name, but different message factory. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2936\">#2936</a>)</li>\n<li>Enable Docker-based tests in CI for JSON Template Layout (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2953\">#2953</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fixed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch MongoDB tests to use Docker. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2229\">#2229</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix reloading of the configuration from an HTTP(S) source (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2937\">#2937</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix <code>putAll()</code> in the default thread context map implementation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2942\">#2942</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Updated</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>org.apache.logging:logging-parent</code> to version <code>11.3.0</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.24.0</h2>\n<p>The <code>2.24.0</code> version of Log4j API has been enhanced with changes from the <code>3.x</code> branch and will be used by both Log4j 2 Core and Log4j 3 Core releases. The changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A faster default <code>ThreadContextMap</code>.</li>\n<li>Enhanced GraalVM support: native binaries that use Log4j API will no longer require additional GraalVM configuration.</li>\n<li>The configuration properties subsystem now only accepts the official pre-2.10 property names and the normalized post-2.10 names.\nCheck your configuration for typos.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html\">Apache Log4j 2 website</a> has been almost entirely rewritten to provide improved documentation and faster access to the information you need.</p>\n<h3>Bridges</h3>\n<p>The JUL-to-Log4j API and Log4j 1-to-Log4j API bridges will no longer be able to modify the configuration of Log4j Core by default.\nIf such a functionality is required, it must be explicitly enabled.</p>\n<h3>Modules</h3>\n<p>The following Log4j Core additional modules have been removed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>log4j-flume-ng</code>\nThe module is no longer part of the release process and will follow its own release lifecycle.\nPlease manage your dependencies using <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/components.html#log4j-bom\"><code>log4j-bom</code></a> to always use its latest version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>log4j-kubernetes</code>\nThe module has been moved to the <a href=\"https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/main/doc/KubernetesLog4j.md\">Fabric8.io Kubernetes project</a> and follows the Fabric8.io release lifecycle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>log4j-mongodb3</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIssue[[4077](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-4077)]\r\n\r\nWhen deploying Nimbus or changing the leadership within a high availability Nimbus cluster, we've verified that the Topologies workers are killed due to different modification times.\r\nBy using the modTime as the version, we have found that, while using the LocalFsBlobStoreFile, every time the the Nimbus leader goes down the following occurs:\r\n\r\n1. Nimbus (1) leader goes down and a new Nimbus (2) picks up the leadership.\r\n2. If blobs in Nimbus (2) have a different modTime workers are restarted (even though they might be the same).\r\n3. Nimbus (1) comes back up, syncs the blobs in the startup and updates the modTime, as it downloads the blobs again.\r\n4. If Nimbus (2) leader goes down, all the workers will be restarted again as Nimbus (1) has new modTime again.\r\n5. This can be repeated endless as the modTime will always be different in each Nimbus leader.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we've introduced a new feature to use the SHA version of the file instead of the modification time. With this feature, when a nimbus loses the leadership, the workers will continue running because the version of the BLOB will continue the same as the BLOB is the same and also it's correspondent SHA.\r\n\r\n## How was the change tested\r\n\r\nUnit Tests\r\nTest locally with specific jar on my local Storm, forced nimbus to change leadership and the workers on the topologies continued to work

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently 'KafkaTridentTransactionalSpoutEmitter' and 'KafkaTridentOpaqueEmitter' polls every partition assigned to the spout one by one while emitting new batches. \r\n\r\nBut this can be improved by leveraging Kafka Consumer's usual polling strategy. That is Kafka Broker will take care of choosing the right partition.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of this are\r\n1. If a spout is assigned multiple Topic Partitions, the consumer doesn't have to waste time on polling partitions with no data.\r\n2. This change will give better control over the Trident batch size, by adjusting Kafka Consumer properties.\r\n\r\nNote: This change will affect only when the batch is emitted for the first time.\r\n\r\n## How was the change tested\r\n\r\nTested by running a Kafka Trident topology locally.","created_at":"2024-08-16T10:10:38Z","updated_at":"2024-09-07T10:26:18Z","closed_at":"2024-09-07T10:21:09Z","merged_at":"2024-09-07T10:21:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"9227ad9b6751f682842b331b89a15a6ee65e3d35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"avermeer","id":17863217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODYzMjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17863217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/avermeer","html_url":"https://github.com/avermeer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avermeer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avermeer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avermeer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avermeer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avermeer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avermeer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avermeer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avermeer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/avermeer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/3679/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/3679/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/3679/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/statuses/d48808f5f077bde0c4cc455b73b3fff1b49d33e8","head":{"label":"anand-h-codes:master","ref":"master","sha":"d48808f5f077bde0c4cc455b73b3fff1b49d33e8","user":{"login":"anand-h-codes","id":96372151,"node_id":"U_kgDOBb6Ftw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96372151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes","html_url":"https://github.com/anand-h-codes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":839172820,"node_id":"R_kgDOMgTC1A","name":"storm","full_name":"anand-h-codes/storm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anand-h-codes","id":96372151,"node_id":"U_kgDOBb6Ftw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96372151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes","html_url":"https://github.com/anand-h-codes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anand-h-codes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anand-h-codes/storm","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, Storm only supports SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) and Kerberos for authentication. However, a more modern and increasingly popular method is mTLS (Mutual Transport Layer Security).\r\n\r\nmTLS leverages SSL/TLS certificates for authentication and encryption, ensuring that both the client and server can verify each other's identities. This dual verification process provides an additional security layer compared to traditional methods.\r\n\r\nFor organizations already using trusted certificates within their infrastructure, integrating mTLS can be more straightforward. It allows them to use the existing certificate management systems, reducing the need for separate authentication setups.\r\n\r\nIn cloud environments, mTLS is often the preferred choice for securing communications. By addressing both encryption and authentication in a single solution, mTLS simplifies the configuration process while enhancing overall security.\r\n\r\n## How was the change tested\r\n\r\nUnit test, and we have been running this on our prod for the last two years.","created_at":"2024-08-12T21:46:03Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T14:52:18Z","closed_at":"2024-08-27T14:52:18Z","merged_at":"2024-08-27T14:52:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"a03b466e28d2fc7dee6c99d0a216c8948048695f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/3678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/3678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/issues/3678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/statuses/aa24f27ca27103312908eaf5ac43e2fead102f3c","head":{"label":"purushah:STORM-4070","ref":"STORM-4070","sha":"aa24f27ca27103312908eaf5ac43e2fead102f3c","user":{"login":"purushah","id":22382070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgyMDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22382070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah","html_url":"https://github.com/purushah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":840910672,"node_id":"R_kgDOMh9HUA","name":"storm","full_name":"purushah/storm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"purushah","id":22382070,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzgyMDcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22382070?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah","html_url":"https://github.com/purushah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/purushah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/purushah/storm","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- Follows up on https://github.com/apache/storm/pull/3654 -> https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/STORM/issues/STORM-4065\r\n- Moves to Jakarta Namespace -> https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/STORM/issues/STORM-3985\r\n- Upgrades Jetty, etc. -> https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/STORM/issues/STORM-4066 + https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/STORM/issues/STORM-4067\r\n- Upgrades Dropwizard Metrics -> https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/STORM/issues/STORM-4065\r\n\r\n## How was the change tested\r\n\r\n- Full CI build\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- This PR modernizes quite a lot of legacy out of date (unmaintained) 3rd party dependencies. The upgrade of metrics required the Jakarta upgrade as well, but user topologies shouldn't be affected by this change.\r\n- Nevertheless, I would propose, that we go for 2.7.0 as a next version because javax -> jakarta can be considered as a breaking

href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/blob/master/changelog.txt\">org.awaitility:awaitility's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Changelog 4.2.1 (2024-03-15)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Kotlin to 1.9.22</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added extension properties forever, then, and, given to the Kotlin extension. This allows you to do e.g.:</p>\n<p>await.forever until { .. }</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added shortcut for enabling logging. Before you had to do e.g.</p>\n<p>await()\n.with()\n.conditionEvaluationListener(new ConditionEvaluationLogger(log::info))\n.pollInterval(ONE_HUNDRED_MILLISECONDS)\n.until(logs::size, is(4));</p>\n<p>You can now instead use the &quot;logging&quot; shortcut:</p>\n<p>await()\n.with()\n.logging(log::info)\n.pollInterval(ONE_HUNDRED_MILLISECONDS)\n.until(logs::size, is(4));</p>\n<p>or simply &quot;.logging()&quot; for &quot;System.out&quot;.</p>\n<p>This shortcut has also been added globally:</p>\n<p>Awaitility.setLogging(log::info);</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>Awaitility.setDefaultLogging();</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved lambda detection for Java 17 and Java 21</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Groovy to 4.0.19</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog 4.2.0 (2022-03-04)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug in the shutdown behavior of a polling thread. The wrong time unit was used causing executor shutdown to take way more time than expected in cases where it's stuck. Thanks to Claus Näveke for spotting this and for the initial PR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug in which condition was not evaluated correctly with small intervals, such as:\nawait().atMost(Duration.ofMillis(10)).pollInterval(Duration.ofMillis(5)).until(..);\n(issue 224). Thanks to Robby Decosemaeker for PR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded the awaitility-kotlin module to use kotlin 1.6.10</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fail fast conditions can now be specified with assertions. For example:</p>\n<p>await().failFast(() -&gt; assertThat(state).isNotEqualTo(&quot;Failed&quot;)).until(..);</p>\n<p>(issue 238)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog 4.1.1 (2021-10-25)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug preventing you to specify &quot;fib(-1)&quot; when using the fibonacci poll interval (thanks to Björn Michael for pull request) (issue 201)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
