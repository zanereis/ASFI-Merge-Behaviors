avoids having two classes to deal with tokens; now the above\r\nclass is a one-stop shop for dealing with delegation tokens. The\r\nYARN backend extends that class instead of doing composition like\r\nbefore, resulting in a bit less code there too.\r\n\r\nThe renewer functionality is basically the same code that used to\r\nbe in YARN's AMCredentialRenewer. That is also the reason why the\r\npublic API of HadoopDelegationTokenManager is a little bit odd;\r\nthe YARN AM has some odd requirements for how this all should be\r\ninitialized, and the weirdness is needed currently to support that.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- YARN with stress app for DT renewal\r\n- Mesos and K8S with basic kerberos tests (both tgt and keytab)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore ORC 1.5.3, `orc.dictionary.key.threshold` and `hive.exec.orc.dictionary.key.size.threshold` are applied for all columns. This has been a big huddle to enable dictionary encoding. From ORC 1.5.3, `orc.column.encoding.direct` is added to enforce direct encoding selectively in a column-wise manner. This PR aims to add that feature by upgrading ORC from 1.5.2 to 1.5.3.\r\n\r\nThe followings are the patches in ORC 1.5.3 and this feature is the only one related to Spark directly.\r\n```\r\nORC-406: ORC: Char(n) and Varchar(n) writers truncate to n bytes & corrupts multi-byte data (gopalv)\r\nORC-403: [C++] Add checks to avoid invalid offsets in InputStream\r\nORC-405: Remove calcite as a dependency from the benchmarks.\r\nORC-375: Fix libhdfs on gcc7 by adding #include <functional> two places.\r\nORC-383: Parallel builds fails with ConcurrentModificationException\r\nORC-382: Apache rat exclusions + add rat check to travis\r\nORC-401: Fix incorrect quoting in specification.\r\nORC-385: Change RecordReader to extend Closeable.\r\nORC-384: [C++] fix memory leak when loading non-ORC files\r\nORC-391: [c++] parseType does not accept underscore in the field name\r\nORC-397: Allow selective disabling of dictionary encoding. Original patch was by Mithun Radhakrishnan.\r\nORC-389: Add ability to not decode Acid metadata columns\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with newly added test cases.","created_at":"2018-10-03T21:12:02Z","updated_at":"2018-10-06T00:12:48Z","closed_at":"2018-10-05T23:46:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e9cdc8ad23b03da8ab68f60f61fd568b1b1bb90a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22622/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22622/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22622/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/70016e4896a42315e82141ac995bf12eded07f51","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-25635","ref":"SPARK-25635","sha":"70016e4896a42315e82141ac995bf12eded07f51","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d7ae36a810bfcbedfe7360eb2cdbbc3ca970e4d0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrent the CSV's infer schema code inlines `TypeCoercion.findTightestCommonType`. This is a minor refactor to make use of the common type coercion code when applicable.  This way we can take advantage of any improvement to the base method.\r\n\r\nThanks to @MaxGekk for finding this while reviewing another PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is a minor refactor.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen using partition filter pushdown to Hive Metastore, the pushdown might fail (depending on the type of partition and if direct SQL mode is enabled in HMS). This change implements a new config option in Spark SQL to decide what to do when a partition filter pushdown fails. The fallback behavior would be to fetch all partitions instead. This might degrade performance depending on the total number of partitions and warnings are added as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests were added to confirm behavior of the new config. All Unit tests on the Spark SQL component were run successfully.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-02T18:28:06Z","updated_at":"2019-09-17T00:39:36Z","closed_at":"2019-09-17T00:39:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6f62211ea25e4a7ee3d89806d229c5b231ac6573","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/01e2123a3ddd0cf0c15d5e79c2beafad821a2cf6","head":{"label":"kmanamcheri:SPARK-25561","ref":"SPARK-25561","sha":"01e2123a3ddd0cf0c15d5e79c2beafad821a2cf6","user":{"login":"kmanamcheri","id":3814576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTQ1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3814576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmanamcheri","html_url":"https://github.com/kmanamcheri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmanamcheri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmanamcheri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmanamcheri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmanamcheri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmanamcheri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmanamcheri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmanamcheri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmanamcheri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmanamcheri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d6be46eb9c68e48f6c0ed1e461649ee9575b2426","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor Pandas UDFs, we get arrow type from defined Catalyst return data type of UDFs. We use this arrow type to do serialization of data. If the defined return data type doesn't match with actual return type of Pandas.Series returned by Pandas UDFs, it has a risk to return incorrect data from Python side.\r\n\r\nCurrently we don't have reliable approach to check if the data conversion is safe or not. We leave some document to notify this to users for now. When there is next upgrade of PyArrow available we can use to check it, we should add the option to check it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nOnly document

GeneralizedLinearRegressionTrainingSummary, it starts a spark job which runs\r\ninto infinite loop and fails with the below exception.\r\n\r\nFix: Remove toString method and move the existing logic to a new method\r\n\"summarize\".

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`InMemoryFileIndex` contains a cache of `LocatedFileStatus` objects. Each `LocatedFileStatus` object can contain several `BlockLocation`s or some subclass of it. Filling up this cache by listing files happens recursively either on the driver or on the executors, depending on the parallel discovery threshold (`spark.sql.sources.parallelPartitionDiscovery.threshold`). If the listing happens on the executors block location objects are converted to simple `BlockLocation` objects to ensure serialization requirements. If it happens on the driver then there is no conversion and depending on the file system a `BlockLocation` object can be a subclass like `HdfsBlockLocation` and consume more memory. This PR adds the conversion to the latter case and decreases memory consumption.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-01T19:35:48Z","updated_at":"2018-10-07T16:45:36Z","closed_at":"2018-10-06T21:55:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81198759ded9a67af2af6afea378db83f387bf84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a50ae71f4c9b035482df20d2565ae553cac350bc","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-25062","ref":"SPARK-25062","sha":"a50ae71f4c9b035482df20d2565ae553cac350bc","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn #20850 when writing non-null decimals, instead of zero-ing all the 16 allocated bytes, we zero-out only the padding bytes. Since we always allocate 16 bytes, if the number of bytes needed for a decimal is lower than 9, then this means that the bytes between 8 and 16 are not zero-ed.\r\n\r\nI see 2 solutions here:\r\n - we can zero-out all the bytes in advance as it was done before #20850 (safer solution IMHO);\r\n - we can allocate only the needed bytes (may be a bit more efficient in terms of memory used, but I have not investigated the feasibility of this option).\r\n\r\nHence I propose here the first solution in order to fix the correctness issue. We can eventually switch to the second if we think is more efficient later.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRunning the test attached in the JIRA + added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-17019](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17019) Expose off-heap memory usage in WebUI. But it makes this additional columns hidden by default. If we want to see them, we need change the css code to rebuild a spark-core.jar. It's very inconvenient.\r\n```\r\n.on_heap_memory, .off_heap_memory {\r\n  display: none;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I add an on-off switch to show those additional columns.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to prevent test slowdowns at `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` by using the latest Apache Spark 2.3.2 link because the Apache mirrors will remove the old Spark 2.3.1 binaries eventually. `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` will not fail because [SPARK-24813](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24813) implements a fallback logic. However, it will cause many trials and fallbacks in all builds over `branch-2.3/branch-2.4/master`. We had better fix this issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with the updated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a rule to force `.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT)` or `toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT)`.\r\n\r\nIt produces an error as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[error]       Are you sure that you want to use toUpperCase or toLowerCase without the root locale? In most cases, you\r\n[error]       should use toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT) or toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT) instead.\r\n[error]       If you must use toUpperCase or toLowerCase without the root locale, wrap the code block with\r\n[error]       // scalastyle:off caselocale\r\n[error]       .toUpperCase\r\n[error]       .toLowerCase\r\n[error]       // scalastyle:on caselocale\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR excludes the cases above for SQL code path for external calls like table name, column name and etc.\r\n\r\nFor test suites, or when it's clear there's no locale problem like Turkish locale problem, it uses `Locale.ROOT`.\r\n\r\nOne minor problem is, `UTF8String` has both methods, `toLowerCase` and `toUpperCase`, and the new rule detects them as well. They are ignored.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and Jenkins tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-28T10:20:17Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:43:01Z","closed_at":"2018-09-30T06:35:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5e3ad815909664cd1148234d2e356361f5352cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22581/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22581/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22581/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bdbfbfe59da6f6ba2814e4816e556c296eab7f59","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-25565","ref":"SPARK-25565","sha":"bdbfbfe59da6f6ba2814e4816e556c296eab7f59","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n``As part of  insert command  in FileFormatWriter, a job context is created for handling the write operation , While initializing the job context using setupJob() API\r\nin HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol , we set the jobid  in the Jobcontext configuration.In FileFormatWriter since we are directly getting the jobId from the map reduce JobContext the job id will come as null  while adding the log. As a solution we shall get the jobID from the configuration of the map reduce Jobcontext.``\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually, verified the logs after the changes.\r\n\r\n![spark-25521

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, in History spark UI, the number of Jobs in the jobs page and \"spark.ui.retainedJobs\" value in \r\n   the  Environment page is not matching.\r\nSo we need to override the spark properties from the History spark-default.conf properties, which will match the number of jobs showing in jobs page and value of \"spark.ui.retainedJobs\" in the Environment Page.\r\nSame applies to other History specific parameters such as \"spark.ui.retainedTasks\" etc.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTested in master branch\r\n1. In the spark-default.conf mentioned the spark.ui.retainedJobs=200\r\n2. In spark shell command mentioned the 100 like below command\r\n     \"spark-shell --master yarn --conf spark.ui.retainedJobs=100\"\r\n\r\nAttached the test result screenshot\r\nspark.ui.retainedJobs

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n**Description from the JIRA :** \r\nCurrently, to collect the statistics of all the columns, users need to specify the names of all the columns when calling the command \"ANALYZE TABLE ...

Instead, we can introduce the following SQL command to achieve it without specifying the column names.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   ANALYZE TABLE [db_name.]tablename COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR ALL

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAllow for pluggable connection factories in the spark jdbc package.\r\n\r\n* new option in JDBCOptions called JDBC_CONNECTION_FACTORY_PROVIDER\r\n* changes to JdbcUtils.createConnectionFactory to use the above\r\n* when unspecified, the existing DefaultConnectionFactoryProvider is used\r\n* provided unit tests\r\n\r\nWithout these changes we had to copy most of the spark jdbc package into our own codebase\r\nto allow us to create our own connection factory in order to load balance queries against\r\nan AWS Aurora postgres cluster.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded unit tests and we use this at Kabbage to load-balance queries against an AWS Aurora postgres cluster with code like the following:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\npackage com.kabbage.rds\r\n\r\nclass RDSLoadBalancingConnectionFactory extends ConnectionFactoryProvider {\r\n  override def createConnectionFactory(options: JDBCOptions): () => Connection = {\r\n    () => LoadDriver(options).connect(RDS.balancedUrl, options.asConnectionProperties)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nobject RDS  {\r\n  lazy val config: Config = ConfigFactory.load(s\"application-${System.getProperty(\"env\")}\").getConfig(\"jobconfig\")\r\n\r\n  lazy val clusterId = config.getString(\"rds.cluster\")\r\n\r\n  lazy val rds = AmazonRDSClientBuilder.defaultClient() // requires AWS_REGION environment variable as well as AWS creds\r\n\r\n  private var endpoints: Seq[String] = null\r\n\r\n  def balancedUrl: String = this.synchronized {\r\n    // initialize or rotate list of endpoints\r\n    endpoints = if (endpoints == null) {\r\n      rds.describeDBInstances().getDBInstances.asScala\r\n        .filter(i => i.getDBClusterIdentifier == clusterId && i.getDBInstanceStatus == \"available\")\r\n        .map(instance => s\"${instance.getEndpoint.getAddress}:${instance.getEndpoint.getPort}\")\r\n    } else endpoints.drop(1) ++ endpoints.take(1)\r\n    endpoints.mkString(s\"jdbc:postgresql://\",\",\",\"/db\")\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nand then enable the factory with something like:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    spark.sqlContext.read\r\n      .format(\"jdbc\")\r\n      .option(JDBCOptions.JDBC_CONNECTION_FACTORY_PROVIDER, \"com.kabbage.rds.RDSLoadBalancingConnectionFactory\")\r\n      .options(connectionProps)\r\n      .option(JDBCOptions.JDBC_TABLE_NAME, table)\r\n  }\r\n```","created_at":"2018-09-26T21:15:35Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T00:07:31Z","closed_at":"2020-01-07T00:07:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9ee573cee78c6f4f9f025a27336adaa08a855bd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`CaseInsensitiveMap` is declared as Serializable. However, it is no serializable after `-` operator or `filterKeys` method.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix the issue by  overriding the operator `-` and method `filterKeys`. So the we can avoid potential `NotSerializableException` on using `CaseInsensitiveMap`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, In the spark UI, when there are failed jobs or failed stages, display message for the completed jobs and completed stages are not consistent with the previous versions of spark.\r\nReason is because, AppSummary holds the information about all the jobs and stages. But, In the below code, it checks against the completedJobs and completedStages. So, AppSummary should hold only successful jobs and stages.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/66d29870c09e6050dd846336e596faaa8b0d14ad/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ui/jobs/AllJobsPage.scala#L306 \r\n https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/66d29870c09e6050dd846336e596faaa8b0d14ad/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ui/jobs/AllStagesPage.scala#L119\r\nSo, we should  keep only completed jobs and stage information in the AppSummary, to make it consistent with Spark2.2\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTest steps:\r\n bin/spark-shell\r\n```\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 5, 5).collect()\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 5, 2).map{ x => throw new RuntimeException(\"Fail\")}.collect()\r\n```\r\n**Before fix:**\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-09-26

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRefactor the read side API according to the abstraction proposed in the [dev list](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/data-source-api-v2-refactoring-td24848.html)\r\n\r\n```\r\nbatch: catalog -> table -> scan\r\nstreaming: catalog -> table -> stream -> scan\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore concretely, this PR\r\n1. add a new interface called `Format` that can return `Table`\r\n2. rename `ReadSupportProvider` to `Table`, represents a logical data set, with a schema.\r\n3. add a new interface `InputStream` to represent a streaming source in a streaming query. It can create `Scan`s.\r\n4. rename `ReadSupport` to `Scan`. Each `Scan` triggers one Spark job. (like an RDD)\r\n\r\nA major change of this PR is about how we execute streaming queries.\r\nPreviously:\r\n1. create a query with `StreamingRelationV2`\r\n2. at the beginning of streaming execution, convert `StreamingRelationV2` to `StreamingExecutionRelation`.\r\n3. for each micro-batch/continuous duration, convert `StreamingExecutionRelation` to `StreamingDataSourceV2Relation`. Then apply query optimization and planning, and run.\r\n\r\nCurrently:\r\n1. create a query with `StreamingRelationV2`\r\n2. at the beginning of streaming execution, convert `StreamingRelationV2` to `MicroBatch/ContinuousExecutionRelation`.\r\n3. do a fake query optimization/planning, get the operator pushdown result and convert `MicroBatch/ContinuousExecutionRelation` to `StreamingDataSourceV2Relation`.\r\n4. for each micro-batch/continuous duration, set offsets for `StreamingDataSourceV2Relation`, do query optimization and planning, and run. Note that, the operator pushdown in the query optimization of this step will be exactly the same as the step 3.\r\n\r\nfollowup:\r\n1. enable operator pushdown for streaming. [prototype](https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark/commit/125289cdb041f2836447c9aee719c8635928bf4c)\r\n2. refactor the API at write side.\r\n3. adopt the idea of logical/phyiscal scan.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn ElementAt, when first argument is MapType, we should coerce the key type and the second argument based on findTightestCommonType. This is not happening currently. We may produce wrong output as we will incorrectly downcast the right hand side double expression to int.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nspark-sql> select element_at(map(1,\"one\", 2, \"two\"), 2.2);\r\n\r\ntwo\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, when the first argument is ArrayType, the second argument should be an integer type or a smaller integral type that can be safely casted to an integer type. Currently we may do an unsafe cast. In the following case, we should fail with an error as 2.2 is not a integer index. But instead we down cast it to int currently and return a result instead.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nspark-sql> select element_at(array(1,2), 1.24D);\r\n\r\n1\r\n```\r\nThis PR also supports implicit cast between two MapTypes. I have followed similar logic that exists today to do implicit casts between two array types.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests in DataFrameFunctionSuite, TypeCoercionSuite.","created_at":"2018-09-25T08:58:48Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T05:49:04Z","closed_at":"2018-09-27T07:08:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83a6e504cf52730d02005ea8222d5f19b3ecce91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22544/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22544/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22544/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/69c78d7655d0f730f0a72cb8fc98b1491de53da1","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:SPARK-25522","ref":"SPARK-25522","sha":"69c78d7655d0f730f0a72cb8fc98b1491de53da1","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch reverts entirely all the regr_* functions added in SPARK-23907. These were added by @mgaido91 (and proposed by @gatorsmile) to improve compatibility with other database systems, without any actual use cases. However, they are very rarely used, and in Spark there are much better ways to compute these functions, due to Spark's flexibility in exposing real programming APIs.\r\n\r\nI'm going through all the APIs added in Spark 2.4 and I think we should revert these. If there are strong enough demands and more use cases, we can add them back in the future pretty easily.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nReverted test cases also.

fix is with reference to the below JIRA Issue which I've created just hours before:\r\n\r\n[SPARK-25517](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25517)\r\n\r\nThis is about spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\").option(\"dateFormat\", \"MM/dd/yyyy\").load(/path/to/csvfile). Assume /path/to/csvfile has a column which contains just date information such as employee joining date, for example:- 02/22/2018 which is 22nd of feb 2018, is a **date** but the spark always incorrectly reads this joining_date column as **string**, whereas the same analogy works perfectly fine with timestampFormat or the timestamp column values in csv.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nto support for detecting date type from the csv files,\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual test\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces support for specifying configmap as spark-configuration.\r\nUsing PR #22146, the above functionality can be achieved by passing template file. However, for spark properties (like log4j.properties, fairscheduler.xml and metrics.properties), we are proposing this approach as this is native to other configuration options specifications in spark.\r\n\r\nThe configmaps has to be pre-created before using this as spark configuration.\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\nAdd the following parameters while doing spark-submit\r\n\r\nspark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.configMap.<volume-name>.mount.path=<mount location inside pod>\r\nspark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.configMap.<volume-name>.options.name=<configmap name>\r\n\r\nUsing these properties, mount the configmap to spark-driver and spark-executor pods.\r\nChanges are required in the `KubernetesVolumeSpec` and `MountVolumesFeatureStep` .\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual testing on a k8s cluster.

Intermediate output of the commands are omitted for the sake of brevity.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nInsertSuite (both in source and in hive sub-packages) were extended with tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to backport SPARK-25460 to branch-2.4:\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to respect `SessionConfigSupport` in SS datasources as well. Currently these are only respected in batch sources:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e06da95cd9423f55cdb154a2778b0bddf7be984c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameReader.scala#L198-L203\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e06da95cd9423f55cdb154a2778b0bddf7be984c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameWriter.scala#L244-L249\r\n\r\nIf a developer makes a datasource V2 that supports both structured streaming and batch jobs, batch jobs respect a specific configuration, let's say, URL to connect and fetch data (which end users might not be aware of); however, structured streaming ends up with not supporting this (and should explicitly be set into options).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-23T02:33:06Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:43:08Z","closed_at":"2018-09-24T15:56:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d22773aaf7602945da4778fc37e20e86910970a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22529/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22529/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22529/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b080b0d7cb018f739afd578c7952d5f23d3375e2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-25460-backport","ref":"SPARK-25460-backport","sha":"b080b0d7cb018f739afd578c7952d5f23d3375e2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen constructing a DataFrame from a Java bean, using nested beans throws an error despite [documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#inferring-the-schema-using-reflection) stating otherwise. This PR aims to add that support.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not yet add nested beans support in array or List fields. This can be added later or in another PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNested bean was added to the appropriate unit test.\r\n\r\nAlso manually tested in Spark shell on code emulating
