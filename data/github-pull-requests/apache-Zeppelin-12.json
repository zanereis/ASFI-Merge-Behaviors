What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nWe can provide properties that are local to the paragraph, that could be used to pass an additional information for interpreter that could affect its behavior.  Unfortunately existing parsing functionality relies on the fact that key/value pairs need to be separated by `,` character, and doesn't handle values with special characters (`,`, `=`, ...) inside, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n%cassandra(locale=ruRU, timeFormat=\"E, d MMM yy\", floatPrecision = 5, outputFormat=cql)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the parsing logic to perform character-by-character parsing, and handling of the quoted keys & values, escaping of the special characters, etc.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nImprovement \r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n*

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nRefactoring of the Cassandra interpreter to a new driver changes the results representation to be strict CQL format, that is not always desirable.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the situation by allow to control the output format (CQL vs human-readable), and also control such things as locale, timezone, format of timestamp/date/time columns, and precision for float & double types.\r\n\r\nAll settings could be set either on interpreter, or cell level.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n*

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nPrevious plugin loading strategy is to load them from system classloader first, if fails, then fallback to plugin folder classloader.

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR provides new Dockerfiles to build a separate Zeppelin server image and interpreter images.\r\n\r\nSome motivations:\r\n - conda is used to install all needed python and R packages \r\n   - conda is able to manage a whole environment and both languages\r\n - files are used for installing python and R dependency\r\n   - it's easy to customize the content of files. No need to change the Dockerfile itself.\r\n   - a file has more readability\r\n   - reduce dependency calculation\r\n - a zeppelin-distribution image is needed\r\n   - you need to build Zeppelin only once, if you want to build new images in parallel on a build cluster\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4154\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* I build the images successfully\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-11T16:10:49Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T11:17:23Z","closed_at":"2020-07-30T08:55:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63101ce78c81350851d54b21362ea76f5c1e9319","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/6cb33b3bf32d1a33b2ee4965425df844196383a8","head":{"label":"Reamer:ZEPPELIN-4154","ref":"ZEPPELIN-4154","sha":"6cb33b3bf32d1a33b2ee4965425df844196383a8","user":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":203154995,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDMxNTQ5OTU=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Reamer/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Reamer","id":454320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NDMyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/454320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer","html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Reamer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Reamer/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

Cron job is for production job, so we should use dedicated interpreter for it instead of using shared interpreter with other notes or users.  Currently interpreter binding mode is determined by note or users (scoped or isolated), This PR introduce `ExecutionContext` which include other factors (isCronMode) to determine how we create interpreters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4763\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Unit test is updated, and manually tested\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nWith this PR, we use spark configuration values for K8s Pod resources. A memory limit is not set because of a potential OOM-Killer.\r\n\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits\r\n> If you set a memory limit of 4GiB for that Container, the kubelet (and container runtime ) enforce the limit. The runtime prevents the container from using more than the configured resource limit. For example: when a process in the container tries to consume more than the allowed amount of memory, the system kernel terminates the process that attempted the allocation, with an out of memory (OOM) error.\r\n\r\n@zjffdu Are using a YARN cluster to schedule your Interpreters? Maybe we should change the location of the calculation class.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n - Improvement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4799\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* **Travis-CI**: https://travis-ci.org/github/Reamer/zeppelin/builds/683269227\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* **Maybe a higher default memory overhead?** Edit: No, because we doesn't need it in the past.\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR allows Git repo directory and notebook directory to be separated so users have the option of having notebook directory nested within git repo.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis patch bumps versions of some components that were reported as having (potential?) vulnerabilities.  It also unifies usage of different hadoop versions, etc., moving version configuration to a top-level pom.xml, instead of specification of them inside individual poms. This for example, also fixes #3702. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nRefactoring\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\n\r\nWe'll need to followup on the other items, like:\r\n* Check dependencies in the Docker image\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* ZEPPELIN-4695\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* https://travis-ci.org/github/alexott/zeppelin/builds/678099649\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

However, there's a [version](https://github.com/stephennancekivell/scalate-maven-plugin) compiled for scala 2.12 [here](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.stephenn/scalate-maven-plugin_2.12/0.0.2/maven-plugin). But no single version compiled for the three scala version (which would be needed for Zeppelin's pom.xml). I've hacked my way [like this](\r\nhttps://github.com/redsk/zeppelin/commit/cb0fa2c5af547974dd995d0db93d90f54a9437f2) just to compile Zeppelin but we probably need a better solution.\r\n* [ ] - Beam. `beam-runners-flink_2.12` does not exist. There seem to be a [workaround](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7544?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Aall-tabpanel) but I've not tried it. I've just disabled Beam from the modules for testing Zeppelin.\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4582\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nNot done yet.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen Zeppelin is running on Kubernetes, SparkUI URL should be dynamically generated, while Kubernetes Service name for Spark interpreter Pod is generated on runtime. And Ingress controller or reverse-proxy route traffic to SparkUI.\r\n\r\nProblem is, depends on those Ingress or reverse proxy configuration, different SparkUI url format might be required.\r\n\r\nCurrently, generated url format is hardcoded to \"//<PORT>-<SERVICE_NAME>.<SERVICE_DOMAIN>\". And letting user set 'zeppelin.spark.uiWebUrl' with static value doesn't help at all while url is decided on runtime.\r\n\r\nThis PR accept [jinja template](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) string from 'zeppelin.spark.uiWebUrl' and bind 3 variables 'PORT', 'SERVICE_NAME', 'SERVICE_DOMAIN'. Therefore any URL pattern required by Ingress/Reverse-proxy can be specified. Each variable has values\r\n\r\n * PORT - spark ui port\r\n * SERVICE_NAME - [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) name for Spark Interpreter Pod.\r\n * SERVICE_DOMAIN - value of SERVICE_DOMAIN env variable.\r\n\r\nFor example, when spark UI is running on port '4040', Service name for Spark interpreter pod is 'spark-wcoyqq', SERVICE_DOMAIN is my.domain.io,\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://port-{{PORT}}-{{SERVICE_NAME}}.{{SERVICE_DOMAIN}}\r\n```\r\nvalue on 'zeppelin.spark.uiWebUrl' property will generate Spark UI link with

Building tablenv is pretty light which won't cost much time. So it is acceptable for this workaround. Another this PR try to fix is the ClassLoader issue for PyFlinkInterpreter.
