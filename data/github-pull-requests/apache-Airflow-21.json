issue this PR fixes was initially discussed in https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/39683.\r\n\r\n@jijoj-hmetrix and I noticed that, starting from Airflow 2.8.0, Kerberos authentication does not seem to work with the stable API. Even when a user provides a valid Kerberos ticket, that the whole gssapi authentication dance is successful, and that the user has the required permissions, the API returns a 403 response.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ curl --negotiate -u: -s --service-name airflow https://airflow-test.xxxx.com/api/v1/pools  | jq .\r\n{\r\n  \"detail\": null,\r\n  \"status\": 403,\r\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\r\n  \"type\": \"https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.10.2/stable-rest-api-ref.html#section/Errors/PermissionDenied\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found that [`airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.fab_auth_manager.FabAuthManager.get_user`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/baf2b3cb4453d44ff00598a3b0c42d432a7203f9/providers/src/airflow/providers/fab/auth_manager/fab_auth_manager.py#L185-L189) relies on flask-login's [current_user](https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login/blob/main/src/flask_login/utils.py#L25) to get the currently logged in user from the session.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Kerberos auth backend stores the authenticated user [in `g`](https://github.com/brouberol/airflow/blob/main/providers/src/airflow/providers/fab/auth_manager/api/auth/backend/kerberos_auth.py#L136) and not in the session.\r\n\r\nThis patch allows the current user to be pulled either from `g` or the session, which allows the API to detect the user authenticated via Kerberos, and then link it to Fab permissions.\r\n\r\nHere's an example from an instance running with the patch, with a admin user associated with a User account with Admin permissions:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ curl --negotiate -u: -s --service-name airflow https://airflow-test.xxx.com/api/v1/pools\r\n{\r\n  \"pools\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"deferred_slots\": 0,\r\n      \"description\": \"Default pool\",\r\n      \"include_deferred\": false,\r\n      \"name\": \"default_pool\",\r\n      \"occupied_slots\": 0,\r\n      \"open_slots\": 128,\r\n      \"queued_slots\": 0,\r\n      \"running_slots\": 0,\r\n      \"scheduled_slots\": 0,\r\n      \"slots\": 128\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"total_entries\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI accompany the change with a small unit test.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

changes to #43520\r\n\r\nThis changes the signature of `cleanup_stuck_queued_tasks` such that it returns Iterable[TaskInstance] instead of List[str] (where the str is a repr).\r\n\r\nWhat are the implications....\r\n\r\nOld provider with new executor:\r\n* we check what kind of object the executor is returning.  if it is a string, then we know it's old executor version.  in that case we just log to stdout of scheduler and move on.\r\n\r\nNew provider with old executor:\r\n* New provider would be yielding TIs instead of strings.  The executor would be expecting list of repr strings.  The repr IN check would not find matches.  Thus nothing would be logged.  Nothing breaks but you don't have the log messages about stuck TIs.  So this combination should be avoided and we might want to bump min version of provider.  Or we could add backcompat code in the providers to yield the reprs in that case.

The reason is simple, if you want to execute an SQL statement or in this case a command from within a PythonOperator, you cannot use the WinRMOperator, you have to use the WinRMHook, so it makes sense that the WinRMHook has the logic to execute the command, not the operator, as the operator is only a facilitator to allow you to run a command from within a DAG\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line

system tests to make sure our OpenLineage integration actually works as expected. Here's what's new:\r\n\r\n- Built a VariableTransport that dumps OpenLineage events into Airflow Variables so we can check them later\r\n- Created a test operator (OpenLineageTestOperator) that compares the events we got against what we expected\r\n- Added a simple test DAG to show how it all works together\r\n- Threw in some helper functions to make event validation less painful (checking

we are switching to uv, breeze dev environment can now also be managed with uv and if you fully switch to it, the workflow of managing breeze, setting the dev environment and upgrading dependencies is far simpler than airflow's so we should be able to follow the regular uv workflow for it - i.e. use uv to manage dependencies, sync, upgrade them etc. This will be really nice way for some of the maintainers to get to learn uv more and prepare for more standardisation in the future Airflow development (maybe) - when we will link uv.lock and constraints management.\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated in Breeze's README to explain some basic way of using uv for breeze development.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license

far `breeze` fully supported only `pipx` installation. For example it would reinstall itself automatically with pipx if you attempted to run it from another workspace/checked out repository of Airflow, and it only provided instructions for pipx.\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n\r\n* the `uv tool` is preferred way to install breeze\r\n* the `pipx` is PSF-governance managed alternative\r\n* breeze will reinstall itself using uv if it has been installed with uv before when it is run from a different workspace or different airflow repo checked out in another folder\r\n\r\nAlso documentation is updated to make `uv` the recommended tool and describing how to install it - with `pipx` provided as an alternative.\r\n\r\nWarning is printed in case pre-commit-uv is not installed with the pre-commit (pre-commit-uv significantly speeds up installation of the venvs by pre-commit). This warning also provides instructions how to install it.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit ddc5670a8c6f2facb490d3f8de297fb7705d3887)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

sometimes creates \"internal\" virtualenvs in local \".build\"\r\ndirectory when it needs - for example in order to run k8s tests\r\nor for release management commands.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds capability to switch breeze to use `uv` instead of\r\n`pip` to install depdendencies in those envs.\r\n\r\nYou can now switch breeze to use uv by `breeze setup config --use-uv`\r\nand switch back to pip by `breeze setup config --no-use-uv`.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit https://github.com/potiuk/airflow/commit/a2a0ef09357f278bde031092e395f13286fd3076)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software

scripts to update pip and uv version were not complete - they did not replace a few of our scripts and documentation. This was especially troublesome for doc replacement, because updating versions manually led to misalignments of tables in markdown.\r\n\r\nLack of completeness of the upgrade caused #43197 and #43135 manual PRs to bump all references.\r\n\r\nAlso an earlier upgrade caused the markdown table to be broken - with UV row table offset by 1.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it:\r\n\r\n* all the scripts and docs are updated now\r\n* when markdown is updated, the table structure is not broken\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 7ede73c85a3e5815b061f9b520e999cd4b5efd52)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Improvement Project: #42881 \r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43340 is merged, we can check in the `get_name` function that the `metric_name` exists in the metrics-registry.yaml file, and throw an error if it doesn't. This will enforce that the `metrics-registry.yaml` exists as a single source of truth for all metrics names. The metrics names from https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/logging-monitoring/metrics.html# will be generated from the `metrics-registry.yaml` file, ensuring that the documentation for metrics names is always up-to-date. \r\n\r\nThe following bash script was used to grep all metric names from the codebase, excluding files ignored by git and tests.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit ls-files | grep -vE '^tests/|^tests_common/' | xargs -I {} grep -oE '\\.(incr|decr|gauge|timer|timing)\\(\"([^\"]+)\"' \"{}\" | awk -F'\"' '{\r\n    type = ($1 ~ /\\.incr|\\.decr/) ? \"counter\" : ($1 ~ /\\.gauge/) ? \"gauge\" : \"timer\";\r\n    print \"- name: \"$2\"\\n  type: \"type\"\\n  description: \\\"\\\"\"\r\n}' > metrics-registry.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n- populate description fields from documentation\r\n- cross reference `metrics-registry.yaml` with documentation to ensure no metrics were missed during the initial grep\r\n- implement existence check when a metric name is used, blocked by #42881 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

compatibility tests in CI are using providers built as packages from sources, so the compatibility tests run there using \"providers/tests\" work just fine, because all providers are installed in the airflow.providers site library. However when we are iterating and debugging backwards compatiblity provider tests, we should be able to use local provider sources, rather than installed packages and we have the possibility of mounting both - providers sources and tests to the image.\r\n\r\nSee `contributing-docs/testing/unit_tests.rst` on how to do it by using ``--mount-sources providers-and-tests`` flag connected with `--use-airflow-version`.\r\n\r\nHowever as of #42505 this has been broken, because currently in main we  rely on airflow having \"pkgutil\" namespace package for both - airflow, and airflow.providers packages (previous airflow versions had implicit package for airflow.providers package) - so providers installed locally cannot be used as \"another\" source of providers.  Previously it was working because both \"installed\" and \"sources\" `airflow.providers` package were implicit namespace packages.\r\n\r\nAs explained in https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages\r\n\r\n> Every distribution that uses the namespace package must include such\r\n> an `__init__.py`. If any distribution does not, it will cause the\r\n> namespace logic to fail and the other sub-packages will not be\r\n> importable. Any additional code in __init__.py will be inaccessible.\r\n\r\nSo because old airflow uses implicit provider's packages and main airflow from source uses \"explicit\" provider's package, the only way we can make the \"source\" providers is to mount them or symbolically link them to inside installed distribution of airflow package (in site directory) (or dynamically remove the __init__.py from provider's source directory.\r\n\r\nWe cannot mount the provider package sources ot inside the installed airflow - because when --use-airflow-version is used, airflow is installed dynamically inside the container - after the container is started.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves the problem by adding an env variable that will make the initialization script to remove the installed airflow.providers folder after installing airflow and linking the \"providers/src/airflow/providers\" folder there. This has the added benefit that all providers (including the preinstalled ones) are used from \"main\" sources rather than from installed packages - which was problematic for the past way of using providers from sources - which used the fact that both \"airflow.providers\" in the site-library and the one in sources were implicit namespace packages.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

we are switching to ``uv`` as our main development tooling, we should explain how to use ``uv`` with airflow and explain some basic commands that should be used to have a workign uv-manaaged venv.\r\n\r\nThis documentation explains some why's and initial hows with uv, also it fixes uv to work on macos with some default extras - such as devel, devel-tests and --all-extras, so that it works on a wider range of systems (includin MacOS). This includes making plyvel not installed on MacOS, because it's next to impossible to compile levelDB on a modern MacOS Operating system and it is anyway an optional component of google provider.\r\n\r\nFixes: #43200\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

of https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/43586\r\n\r\n## Changes \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new endpoint `/execution/{task_instance_id}/state` that will allow Updating the State of the TI from the worker.\r\n\r\nSome of the interesting changes / TILs were:\r\n\r\n### Minified Schema & Use of Discriminated union schemas\r\n\r\n(hat tip to @ashb for this)\r\n\r\nTo streamline the data exchange between workers and the Task Execution API, this PR adds minified schemas for Task Instance updates i.e. focuses solely on the fields necessary for specific state transitions, reducing payload size and validations. Since our TaskInstance model is huge this also keeps it clean to focus on only those fields that matter for this case.\r\n\r\nThe endpoint added in this PR also leverages Pydantic’s [discriminated unions](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/unions/#discriminated-unions) to handle varying payload structures for each target state. This allows a single endpoint to receive different payloads (with different validations). For example:\r\n\r\n- `TIEnterRunningPayload`: Requires fields such as hostname, unixname, pid, and start_date to mark a task as RUNNING.\r\n- `TITerminalStatePayload`: Supports terminal states like SUCCESS, FAILED, SKIPPED,\r\n- `TITargetStatePayload`: Allows for other non-terminal, non-running states that a task may transition to.\r\n\r\nThis is better so we don't have invalid payloads for example adding a start_date when a task is marked as SUCCESS, it doesn't make sense and it might be an error from the client!\r\n\r\n![Nov-04-2024 20-00-26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c1a197-0238-4c1a-9783-f23dd74a8d3e)\r\n\r\n\r\n### `status` codes\r\n\r\n`fastapi` allows importing a handy `status` module from starlette which has status code and the reason in its name. Reference: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/status/\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n`status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT` and `status.HTTP_409_CONFLICT` explain a lot more than just a \"204 code\" which doesn't tell much. ~I plan to change our current integers on public API to these in coming days.~ Done ✅ : https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43663\r\n\r\n## Assumption\r\n\r\nFor now, I have assumed that we/the user don't care about `end_date` for `REMOVED` & `UPSTREAM_FAILED` status since they should be handled by the scheduler and shouldn't even show up on the worker. \r\nFor `SKIPPED` state, since there are 2 scenarios:\r\n 1) A user can run the task and raise a `AirflowSkipException`\r\n 2) a task skipped on scheduler itself! For (1), we could set an end date, but (2) doesn't have it. \r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n\r\nThe following items will be done as future work -- they have been added to the [AIP-72 project board](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/405).\r\n- [ ] Pass a [RFC 9457](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9457) compliant error message in \"detail\" field of `HTTPException` to provide more information about the error\r\n- [ ] Add a separate heartbeat endpoint to track the TI’s active state.\r\n- [ ] Replace handling of `SQLAlchemyError` with FastAPI's [Custom Exception handling](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/#install-custom-exception-handlers) across the Execution API endpoints. That way we don't need duplicate code across multiple endpoints.\r\n- [ ] Replace `None` state on TaskInstance with a `Created` state. ([link](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/405/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=85900878))\r\n- [ ] Remove redundant code that also sets task state once we remove DB access from the worker. This is assuming that the Webserver or the new FastAPI endpoints don't use this endpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Ash Berlin-Taylor <ash@apache.org>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above

is part of the work for AIP-72 epic, but is done as a separate PR for\nease of review.\n\nThis PR byitself doesn't remove the LocalTaskJob row (that will happen in a\nfuture PR when the exeuction code is moved over to live in the TaskSDK) but\nthis paves the way for it. The reason we are making this change is:\n\n- Having a separate row for tracking TI heartbeat is not really buying us much\n- With the addition of TaskInstanceHistory we don't need _another_ separate\n  record of when/where TIs were run\n- It simplifies things (one less join in finding zombies)\n- Makes zombie tracking eaiser -- it is now just on the TI state, not the\n  combination of TI and Job state.\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor license agreements.

switch breeze to use `uv` instead of `pip` to install depdendencies in those envs.\r\n\r\nYou can now switch breeze to use uv by `breeze setup config --use-uv` and switch back to pip by `breeze setup

hours ago Flit released a new version (3.10.0) that bumped versio of metadata used to generate providers. That revealed a bug in the reproducibility setup for our providers. Previously the providers had flit>=3.2,<4 as build dependency - but that caused newer flit version to be used during the build and - since flit bumped the metadata-version produced, it caused the packages generated to be binary non-reproducible.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by \"pinning\" flit version (all build dependencies should generally be pinned to provide reproducibility)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Python 3.13 compiler, docstrings are automatically dedented. And while Python 3.13 is not yet officially supported by Airflow for some strange (and unknown) reasons, when you install breeze with uv tools that have Python 3.13 installed, it might get into a state that the docstrings are dedented in Breeze's bytecode and it causes hash calculation for configuration options that have docstring-generated help differs on different installations.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it consistent - we are now always dedenting the help strings before hash calculation.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81283\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

part of the changes in AIP-72 to have \"activities\" (i.e. TaskExecuteActivity) and the need to shortly move the StandardTaskRunner into the TaskSDK, and before doing that I want to simplify the strucutre.\n\nTo that end, the CGroupTaskRunner is being removed. While it (likely/probably) still works, it's use is very uncommon as it does not work within Docker or Kubernetes deployment (as it is not currently possible to nest cgroups inside a container in practice).\n\nIn this PR I have removed the config option and task_runner loader concept, deleted the CGroupRunner and merged Base and Starndard TaskRunner classes.\n\n I have also started keeping an \"umberalla\" newsfragment where we can track all AIP-72 related changes (of which there will be a lot)\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor license agreements.

Instead, if a running task has its state externally changed (what undead tasks is referring to in the docs), the logs display the below message where \"x\" is the new task state ([source code](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/d3e181215218ca9d0fb510c29d646c2aea315fcb/airflow/jobs/local_task_job_runner.py#L346-L348)).\r\n```\r\n\"State of this instance has been externally set to <x>. Terminating instance.\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no reference to undead tasks within this log message or anywhere else in Airflow (I think). Therefore, users do not search for the term \"undead tasks\" when they encounter this error. Including it in the documentation seems unhelpful and can even be confusing if users conflate it with zombie tasks.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the line in the documentation above the code snippet states: \"Below is the code snippet from the Airflow scheduler that runs periodically to detect zombie/undead tasks.\" This line is incorrect because the snippet only contains code for detecting zombies. The code to detect tasks whose state has been changed externally is in local_task_job_runner.py.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful
