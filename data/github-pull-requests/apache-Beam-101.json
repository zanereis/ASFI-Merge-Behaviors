This component receives a change stream name, a partition, a start time and an end time to query. It then initiates a change stream query with the received parameters.\r\n\r\nWithin a change stream, 3 types of records can be received:\r\n\r\n1. A Data record\r\n2. A Heartbeat record\r\n3. A Child partitions record\r\n\r\nUpon receiving (1), the function updates the watermark with the record's commit timestamp and emits the record into the output PCollection.\r\nUpon receiving (2), the function updates the watermark with the record's timestamp, but it does not emit any record into the PCollection.\r\nUpon receiving (3), the function updates the watermark with the record's timestamp and writes the new child partitions into the metadata table. These partitions will be later scheduled by the DetectNewPartitions component.\r\n\r\nOnce the change stream query for the element partition finishes, it marks the partition as finished in the metadata table and terminates.","created_at":"2022-01-14T04:24:31Z","updated_at":"2022-01-21T02:04:29Z","closed_at":"2022-01-21T02:04:29Z","merged_at":"2022-01-21T02:04:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"f43789ae454fd5f60cf30521e25f8bb8487716eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/16514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/16514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/16514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/c074b0f7535e7f12b467864ca9441226f06dd57e","head":{"label":"thiagotnunes:change-stream-read-partition","ref":"change-stream-read-partition","sha":"c074b0f7535e7f12b467864ca9441226f06dd57e","user":{"login":"thiagotnunes","id":302813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjgxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes","html_url":"https://github.com/thiagotnunes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"872455570ae7f3e2e35360bccf93b503ae9fdb5c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50904245,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDkwNDI0NQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"apache/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam","description":"Apache

Elasticsearch Unit Test Flakiness\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFixes BEAM-13137 and possibly BEAM-5172.  Elasticsearch read/split/size has often been flaky in unit tests, and it may be due to the non-deterministic nature of `_flush` whereby data buffered in the translog of ES is flushed to the index; this process happens independently of index `refresh`.  Adding explicit use of flush has stabilized tests locally. Next step is to see if this translates to stability in automated unit tests.\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`documentation/sdks/java-multi-language-pipelines`.\r\n* Retitled the cross-language page, which documents Java multi-language pipelines, to match the Python content.\r\n* Added a note that the page is a work in progress.\r\n* Redirected `documentation/patterns/cross-language` to the new Java multi-lang quickstart. To test, try this link on the staging server: http://apache-beam-website-pull-requests.storage.googleapis.com/16504/documentation/patterns/cross-language/index.html\r\n* Updated menus and links accordingly.\r\n* Eventually we need to fix the Java multi-lang content: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13654\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

usage of `SnsIO.write` is rather unintuitive at the moment.\r\n\r\n`topicArn` is a required configuration and during `expand` the existence of the topic is validated.\r\n\r\nHowever, the user also has to provide a function to build an SNS publish request. The `topicArn` for that publish request can be set as well, but can be different from the one configured and validated in the writer. \r\n\r\nThis can be confusing and makes any validation pointless. The new behavior is as follows:\r\n- If `topicArn` is set for `SnsIO.write` it is validated during `expand`. That `topicArn` is also set for each publish request (and may override another `topicArn` if already set).\r\n- if `topicArn` is not set, no validation is done. The user is expected to set the `topicArn` on the publish request builder or provide an alternative such as a `targetArn`.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, after validation the SNS client instance was previously not closed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

eight new tests for DataFlow and one Direct runner test, along with the necessary configurations, e.g. Gradle JavaToolchain, SDK 17 path, etc.\r\n\r\nThe JavaToolchain was added so that compilation using SDK8 and execution with SDK17 was possible. Only three tests are ran this way.\r\n\r\nThe --add-opens flag was added to the sdk/java/harness/guild.gradle file to bypass the exception thrown by the JAMM library as it uses a few java.lang.reflection methods which SDK17 doesn't like.\r\nBeware that the aforementioned change should be done for all modules that exist on the classpath and only access to jamm should be provided; per https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15675/#issuecomment-1007801930 \r\n\r\nAlso, the docker repo for the image is here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/apache/beam_java17_sdk\r\n\r\nEdit: The test executed by trigger \"Run Load Tests Java 17 CoGBK Dataflow V2 Streaming\" is the one throwing the InaccessibleObjectException.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

with fields being package private, `SqsMessage` and with that `SqsIO.read` for AWS Sdk v2 is barely usable.\r\n\r\n- Visibility of all fields was fixed from `package private` to `public`.\r\n- [BREAKING] Datatype of timestamp fields was changed from `String` to `long`, which is obviously a breaking change but seems reasonable as this IO is most likely not used for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

up to this [pr](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15233). A couple months ago we loosen typing extensions to any typing extensions <4. Well, typing extensions release a version 4 that is backwards compatible with 3 as they no longer want to follow python versions. The old versioning of typing extensions was based on python version (3.10 meant python 3.10 features). So we should support version 4 at least.\r\n\r\nTyping extensions is about to release a version 5 too. The only backwards incompatible change is typing extensions version 5 drops support for 3.6 now that it is end of life. That should be safe as someone using 3.6 will automatically pick version 4 at most due to [python_requires](https://github.com/python/typing/blob/dea3e3eefb92748559fb8e2202f3e2d70a8d8517/typing_extensions/pyproject.toml#L25) line in typing extensions. I think backwards incompatible typing-extensions change except for EOL python is very unlikely as it would break typeshed/typing ecosystem. So I do not think beam needs to upper bound typing extensions. beam is only package out of 100s I depend on that upper bounds typing-extensions. \r\n\r\nThe upper bound is currently blocking some usage of newer type features (pep [655](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0655/) requires typing extensions 4). I expect tensorflow/pytorch/numpy to all want to use TypeVarTuple in the near future because it allows proper tensor shape typing. That will be feature of typing extensions 5 in the near future.\r\n\r\n@chadrik @udim @tvalentyn

bigtable mutate row might return None instead of Status when running\r\n   into retryable errors. Handled the special case as DEADLINE_EXCEEDED\r\n   because bigtable must have exhausted the retry timeout or when there\r\n   is no retry policy inplace.\r\n2. For all rows mutated, if the response status is not ok, that data\r\n   might have lost. Added a TODO item for that.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
