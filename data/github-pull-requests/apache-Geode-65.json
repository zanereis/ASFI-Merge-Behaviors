\r\nIt appears to be an intermittent thing, but passing `anyInt()` or similar argument matchers to non-mock classes can result in a test failing.  See the Travis for a recent PR of mine\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/geode/builds/339119584?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification\r\nor the JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-4642\r\n\r\nI also refactored this class, drive predominantly by IDE inspections.  For instance, it's beyond the scope of this class to make sure that `new Boolean` returns a `Boolean`.  Consequently, there was a lot of unnecessary parameter boxing and variable instantiation only to call `.getClass()`.\r\n\r\nInner classes should not be interspersed with methods.  Put them either at the beginning or the end of the class, whichever is more appropriate for readability.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI've left the refactor and the correction commits separate for ease of review, to be squashed at commit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
