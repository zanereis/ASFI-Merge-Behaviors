Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nImplements #779 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFederatedZkClient (One FederatedZkClient, multiple Zookeeper sessions inside)\r\n- Some Helix Java APIs such as HelixAdmin can only perform CRUD operations.\r\n- In order to enable such Java APIs to operate against multiple Zookeeper realms, we will create FederatedZkClient, which is a new version of ZkClient that could replace the existing HelixZkClient used by CRUD-only Java APIs.\r\n- FederatedZkClient will internally maintain multiple ZooKeeper sessions connecting to different ZooKeeper realms on an as-needed basis.\r\n- By creating and maintaining multiple ZooKeeper sessions, FederatedZkClient will route incoming ZooKeeper requests to the appropriate ZooKeeper sessions based on the ZK path sharding key.\r\n\r\nFederatedZkClient (implements RealmAwareZkClient)\r\n- An implementation of RealmAwareZkClient that connects to multiple ZK realms.\r\n- Supports CRUD + change subscription.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n - TestFederatedZkClient\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] ---

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #778 , #794 , #795 , #800 , #801\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBecause of the single-writer design for `ZkRoutingDataWriter`, we are utilizing `ZkDistributedLeaderElection` to choose a leader instance and non-leaders will forward write requests to the leader. This PR:\r\n1. implements the logic for request forwarding; \r\n2. changes the current MSDS endpoints behaviors such that the endpoints now respect the return values of underlying methods (previously, if the underlying methods return `false`, the endpoints will still return `OK` which is not desirable); \r\n3. enables the previously disabled MSDS endpoints tests;\r\n4. fixes `TestMetadataStoreDirectoryAccessor` to allow tests to be run in leader mode (the previous version disallows tests to be run in leader mode);\r\n5. fixes 2 bugs that break endpoionts tests (#794, #795);\r\n6. adds unit tests for follower situations in `TestZkRoutingDataWriter`, which uncovers a bug on leader election that causes null pointer for followers (#801, fixed);\r\n7. makes ZkMetadataStoreDirectory singleton (#800);\r\n8. added integration tests for the entire flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 131, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 24.278 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 131, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  52.393 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-25T18:48:33-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(Fixes #784 )\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe `clone` method is not quite clean in its implementation, readers can hardly tell which `_eventAttributeMap` is the old event versus the new one.\r\n\r\nAlso, the stack trace in #784 proves the possibility of ConcurrentModificationException. A right and straightforward way is to make the current attribute map concurrent and thread-safe\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n- TestClusterEvent#testClone\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\nEND testSessionExpiredWhenResetHandlers at Wed Feb 19 19:03:44 PST 2020, took: 7722ms.\r\nShut down zookeeper at port 2183 in thread main\r\nTests run: 1083, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,470.368 sec <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\ntestMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring(org.apache.helix.integration.controller.TestControllerLeadershipChange)  Time elapsed: 4.353 sec  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.fail(Assert.java:89)\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:480)\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:37)\r\n\tat org.testng.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:47)\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.controller.TestControllerLeadershipChange.testMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring(TestControllerLeadershipChange.java:262)\r\n\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nFailed tests: \r\n  TestControllerLeadershipChange.testMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring:262 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\r\nTests run: 1083, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\nThe failed test passed in IDE\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix will introduce the concept of customized state, which allows customer to define the states they are interested. Helix will also help aggregate these states for customers' easier usage. This PR implements a new cluster level config called customized state aggregation config. If customer would like Helix to aggregate their customized states, they need to add the specific customized state in this config. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestCustomizedStateAggregationConfig\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 905, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,340.648 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testJobQueueAddingJobsOneByOne(org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestEnqueueJobs)  Time elapsed: 10.104 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.apache.helix.HelixException: Workflow \"testJobQueueAddingJobsOneByOne\" context is null or job \"testJobQueueAddingJobsOneByOne_JOB0\" is not in states: [COMPLETED]\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestEnqueueJobs.testJobQueueAddingJobsOneByOne(TestEnqueueJobs.java:32)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnqueueJobs.testJobQueueAddingJobsOneByOne:32 » Helix Workflow \"testJobQue...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 905, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X ] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #774 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHttpRoutingDataReader is a component used by new ZkClient APIs to make an HTTP read request to the metadata store directory service to retrieve routing data. ZkClient APIs will construct an internal MetadataStoreRoutingData instance based on the raw routing data retrieved from MSDS.\r\n\r\nNote: this change contains modifications to MockMSDS because the actual endpoint names changed. The methods and http server contexts have been updated.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestHttpRoutingDataReader\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nzookeeper-api\r\n\r\n> [INFO]  T E S T S\r\n> [INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] Running TestSuite\r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 7, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.429 s - in TestSuite\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Results:\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 7, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] Total time:  7.497 s\r\n> [INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-22T17:59:33-08:00\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

#762 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs part of ZkClient API enhancement, we wish to add SharedZkClient, which is a wrapper of the raw ZkClient, that provides realm-aware access to ZooKeeper.\r\n\r\nRealm-aware in that it only performs requests whose path's Zk path sharding key belongs to the ZK realm it's connected to.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to modify SharedZkClientFactory so that users could use this factory to generate instances of SharedZkClient.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #766 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAs part of ZkClient API enhancement, we wish to add DedicatedZkClient, which is a wrapper of the raw ZkClient, that provides realm-aware access to ZooKeeper.\r\n\r\nRealm-aware in that it only performs requests whose path's Zk path sharding key belongs to the ZK realm it's connected to.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to modify DedicatedZkClientFactory so that users could use this factory to generate instances of DedicatedZkClient.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nRealmAwareZkClientTestBase\r\nTestDedicatedZkClient\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n> [INFO] Results:\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n> [INFO]

------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

We make use of the existing trie structure to efficiently check if a sharding key results in an ambiguity case. Some old code in `TrieRoutingData` is modified to minimize duplicate code and make everything a lot cleaner. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 143, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 21.642 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 143, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  47.466 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-13T11:13:56-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #750 0   \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `getAllMappingUnderPath` and `getMetadataStoreRealm` in `ZkMetadataStoreDirectory`. Also, `ZkRoutingDataReader` is updated specifically in `getRoutingData`: not having realm addresses and not having sharding keys for some realm addresses no longer raise exceptions. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 127, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 19.928 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 127, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  44.894 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-11T11:09:09-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #760 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nRealmAwareZkClient and RealmAwareZkClientFactory are going to be the top-level interfaces for other realm-aware ZkClient APIs (think FederatedZkClient, DedicatedZkClient, etc.).\r\n\r\nRealmAwareZkClient will support all the existing interface methods that HelixZkClient supports.\r\nRealmAwareZkClientFactory will be the interface implemented by SharedZkClientFactory and DedicatedZkClientFactory.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nInterface methods without logic - no tests added.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nbuild passed.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin \n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n##

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#728 )\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, Helix only supports a single state for every partition. There're increasing requests from customers to have more than one state, which is defined in Helix state model, for their practical use. For example, they may want to have read/write state, quota state, version state, etc. Helix will introduce the concept of customized state, which allows customer to define the states they are interested. \r\nThis PR is to implement Helix API for customers to import their customized state. The customized state is adjacent to CURRENT_STATE as a separate znode. Under this znode, there are children znodes representing each individual customized state. And each customized state is categorized by resources.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestCustomizedStateUpdate.java\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 902, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,610.949 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testWorkflowFailureJobThreshold(org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestJobFailureDependence)  Time elapsed: 300.01 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.testng.internal.thread.ThreadTimeoutException: Method org.testng.internal.TestNGMethod.testWorkflowFailureJobThreshold() didn't finish within the time-out 300000\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobFailureDependence.testWorkflowFailureJobThreshold » ThreadTimeout Metho...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 902, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:00 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-06T09:58:26-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:3.0.0-M3:test (default-test) on project helix-core: There are test failures.\r\n[ERROR] \r\n[ERROR] Please refer to /home/mnzhang/helix/helix-core/target/surefire-reports for the individual test results.\r\n[ERROR] Please refer to dump files (if any exist) [date].dump, [date]-jvmRun[N].dump and [date].dumpstream.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #725 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe need a separate ZkClient-based writer that could allow users to write routing data to ZK. This diff adds such an interface, an implementation, and a distributed lock implementation that could help users to manipulate the routing data.\r\n\r\nChangelist:\r\n1. Add ZkRoutingDataWriter (+ interface)\r\n2. Add ZkDistributedLock (+ interface) to guarantee that there's at most one active writer at a time (where there are multiple Helix REST deployables)\r\n3. Add a test for ZkRoutingDataWriter\r\n4. Integrate ZkRoutingDataWriter with ZkMetadataStoreDirectory\r\n5. Add test methods to TestZkMetadataStoreDirectory\r\n6. Add ZkDistributedElection to replace ZkDistributedLock (and move ZkDistributedLock to a separate PR)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZkRoutingDataWriter\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2124 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2124 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2123 in thread main\r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 117, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 21.253 s - in TestSuite\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Results:\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 117, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] --- maven-surefire-plugin:3.0.0-M3:test (multi-zk) @ helix-rest ---\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n...\r\n\r\n> End test :testInvalidHelixRestServerInitialization\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2123 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2124 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2124 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2125 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2123 in thread main\r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 117, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 24.038 s - in TestSuite\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Results:\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 117, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] Total time:  51.877 s\r\n> [INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-05T21:14:05-08:00\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nhelix-rest run:\r\n\r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 117, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 20.951 s - in TestSuite\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Results:\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 117, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] Total time:  47.479 s\r\n> [INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-09T16:28:51-08:00\r\n> [INFO] ----------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nNewest run:\r\n\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2124 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2125 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2123 in thread main\r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 127, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 20.768 s - in TestSuite\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Results:\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 127, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] Total time:  47.168 s\r\n> [INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-10T16:56:16-08:00\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #721\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMetadataStoreDirectory is an object that provides Metadata Store Directory APIs (routing APIs, CRUD of routing data, etc.). Helix REST will use this object to serve Metadata Store Directory Service REST endpoints.\r\nAlso, it will make appropriate changes to the ZK access layer to listen on changes on the routing data.\r\n\r\nChangelist:\r\n- Refactor AbstractTestClass to make multi-ZK setup work\r\n- Add implementation of MetadataStoreDirectory\r\n- Add TestZkMetadataStoreDirectory\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZkMetadataStoreDirectory\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-rest:\r\n\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:04 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-05T10:31:41-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

from #716 \r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #715 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn order to support ZK horizontal scalability, we need to have Metadata Store Directory Service, which is a feature provided by Helix REST. Helix APIs that talk to ZooKeeper will query against this service at initialization to fetch all metadata store routing keys.\r\nFor Helix application developers, this means that there's potentially a lot to do for setting up a testing environment assuming multiple ZKs. This MockMetadataStoreDirectoryServer makes it easy to test by abstracting out the work of having to set up and write metadata store routing information to the routing ZK.\r\nChangelist:\r\n1. Implement Mock MSDS\r\n2. Write a test in main()\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThe class contains a main function where users can test locally.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2123 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2124 in thread main\r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 102, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 20.522 s - in TestSuite\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Results:\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 102, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-04T02:35:24Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T23:21:12Z","closed_at":"2020-02-04T23:20:53Z","merged_at":"2020-02-04T23:20:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc033f12b0cb81edd809af1789d26d5c6c11cc83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/719/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/719/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/719/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/a37b1eb3e4c52342a02c2b9c803e8c5dc92ec65a","head":{"label":"apache:mockMSDS","ref":"mockMSDS","sha":"a37b1eb3e4c52342a02c2b9c803e8c5dc92ec65a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":15861701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTg2MTcwMQ==","name":"helix","full_name":"apache/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #708 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis is a part of the Helix lock manager service. A HelixLock interface has been added and this PR is the implementation of nonblocking lock according to the interface. This nonblocking lock uses a single persistent znode to represent a lock on a resource. Upon calling acquireLock, the user either gets a \"true\" if they successfully acquired the lock meaning they can start their work on the resource, or a \"false\" if someone else currently has the lock meaning that they cannot work on this resource at this time. User can release the lock when they are done with their work, as well as get the lock information such as the current owner of the lock, any messages left by the lock owner, or the timeout of the lock.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestZKHelixNonblockingLock\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 70.838 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:13 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-04T17:58:59-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki

details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn order to support ZK horizontal scalability, we need to have Metadata Store Directory Service, which is a feature provided by Helix REST. Helix APIs that talk to ZooKeeper will query against this service at initialization to fetch all metadata store routing keys.\r\nFor Helix application developers, this means that there's potentially a lot to do for setting up a testing environment assuming multiple ZKs. This MockMetadataStoreDirectoryServer makes it easy to test by abstracting out the work of having to set up and write metadata store routing information to the routing ZK.\r\nChangelist:\r\n1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #713  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an interface and an implementation for metadata store routing data accessing. The interface works directly with `MetadataStoreRoutingData`, acting as an abstract layer that allows the data to be accessed from different sources. The implementation focuses on accessing data from ZooKeeper. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 100, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 20.581 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 100, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  25.231 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-01-31T17:53:37-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #711 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPrior to instrumenting Helix APIs and components so that they would be aware of multiple ZKs for horizontal scalability, we need to have a way to run all integration tests involving ZooKeeper in different environments: one with a single ZK and another with multiple ZKs.\r\nChangelist:\r\n1. Implement the logic in ZkTestBase so that in conjunction with maven-surefire-plugin configs, there will be two executions of the test suite\r\n2. Remove system property variable from default-test since it's unnecessary\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nManual testing by way of mvn test:\r\n\r\n[INFO]  T E S T S\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Running TestSuite\r\nStart zookeeper at localhost:2183 in thread main\r\nStart zookeeper at localhost:2184 in thread main\r\nStart zookeeper at localhost:2185 in thread main\r\n\r\nSpins up 3 ZKs as expected.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core:\r\n\r\n1st run:\r\n\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2183 in thread main\r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 900, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,378.408 s - in TestSuite\r\n> [INFO]\r\n> [INFO] Results:\r\n> [INFO]\r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 900, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n> [INFO]\r\n> [INFO]\r\n\r\n2nd run (multi-zk);\r\n\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2183 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2183 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2184 in thread main\r\n> Shut down zookeeper at port 2185 in thread main\r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 900, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,294.053 s - in TestSuite\r\n> [INFO]\r\n> [INFO] Results:\r\n> [INFO]\r\n> [INFO] Tests run: 900, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n> [INFO]\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] Total time:  01:51 h\r\n> [INFO] Finished at: 2020-01-31T19:23:32-08:00\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-01T01:27:14Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T20:10:52Z","closed_at":"2020-02-04T20:10:52Z","merged_at":"2020-02-04T20:10:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"76d6260dd2eea03b1dab8b4a1f8a1a8b4f5d3255","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/712/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/712/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/712/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/5bf2029005d0450167ad89739c0dd58841e4b721","head":{"label":"narendly:zktestbase","ref":"zktestbase","sha":"5bf2029005d0450167ad89739c0dd58841e4b721","user":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126890023,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY4OTAwMjM=","name":"helix","full_name":"narendly/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/narendly/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #709 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe want to achieve horizontal scalability for ZK, meaning we want to allow users to add more ZK deployments and shard based on the ZK read/write path. To test this going forward, we want to be able to execute existing tests in two different environments: 1. single-ZK env, and 2. multi-ZK env.\r\nChangelist:\r\n1. Create two executions for maven-surefire-plugin with multiZk system property\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nManually tested\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #701 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a successor to PR #682 . \r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the github issue, the original design of `ShardingKeyTrieNode` had numerous issues as revealed by the previous PR's comments, and therefore a new design is purposed and implemented. The previous design's has the following issues:\r\n\r\n1. Since the trie node is exposed to outside users, extra effort is necessary to prevent misuse, such as making the children unmodifiable and make zkRealmAddress getter conditionally inaccessible. \r\n2. Implementation details of the trie node are not properly obscured. For any user to iterate through the trie, the user needs to get the children mapping of a node and continue forward. \r\n3. Traversal logic is not offered as at any common place and therefore can easily lead to repetition among different users.\r\n\r\nWith the new `TrieRoutingData` class, the trie node is encapsulated as a private class, therefore preventing any misuse. The class offers a sufficient but restrictive set of operations that outsider users may use, and can be expanded upon if necessary. The class implements the `RoutingData` interface, meaning that other forms of routing data can be implemented later to substitute `TrieRoutingData` if necessary. \r\n\r\nNOTE: this PR does not complete the `TrieRoutingData` class. The current constructor is a placeholder (as noted in code comments) because the actual constructor is dependent on a `RoutingDataAccessor` class which is yet to be implemented (but is second in order). Once the accessor is complemented the constructor will be written in a separate PR. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 97, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 19.733 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 97, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  23.970 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-01-29T13:30:43-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #699 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe implemented a new API `ZkClient.createEphemeral(path, data, sessionId)` to validate the zk session and create a live instance. Currently, live instance creation is still using the old API `createEphemeral(path, data)` without the session ID. So zk session race condition is not completely fixed.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the api to use `createEphemeral(path, data, sessionId)` for live instance creation. A new test is added to cover the case of using the old API. If the old API is used, the test will fail like below:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: Live instance should not be created because zk session is expired!\r\nExpected :true\r\nActual   :false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- TestParticipantManager.testSessionExpiryCreateLiveInstance\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 898, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,370.606 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 898, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  56:15 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-01-22T21:35:30-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix will provide a function for participant to auto register to the cluster so that no manual efforts are needed for adding instance to a cluster. To realize it, a cloud instance information processor will take the responsibility for getting and parsing the instance information from cloud. Different cloud providers will have different implementations for the processor. This PR implement the processor for Azure as a first use case.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestAzureCloudInstanceInformationProcessor\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 904, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,221.481 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 904, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  53:45 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-01-22T09:57:03-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[mnzhang@mnzhang-ld1 helix-core]$ git status\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#694 )\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix is adding a new feature in which a participant may auto register itself to the cluster after connects. Different from current auto join function, auto registration will not only set up all the config information for the instance, but also retrieve the fault domain information for the participant, and register all this information to the cluster. This PR changes the logic in ParticipantManager by adding the auto registration logic. Two flags are used to denote auto join and auto registration. AutoJoin flag must be true if we would like to allow autoRegstration. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 904, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,221.481 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 904, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  53:45 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-01-22T09:57:03-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#689\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere is sometimes test failing because some znodes created in a test method didn't get deleted and it makes another test method's result false because we use one Zk cluster for all test methods in the same test class.\r\nI added code to delete the created znodes at the end of each test method so each test method is truly independent.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 897, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,521.447 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 897, Failures: 0,

I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

list:\r\n1. Move the stateful WAGED rebalancer to the GenericHelixController object instead of the rebalance stage. This is for resolving the possible race condition between the event processing thread and leader switch handling thread.\r\n2. Adding a new test regarding leadership switch to verify that the WAGED rebalancer has been reset after the processing.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestWagedRebalance.testRebalancerReset\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestZKUtil.testChildrenOperations:80 expected:<2> but was:<4>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1067, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\nRe-run\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 14.357 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 11, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(FIX #687)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\nZkClient will re-install the watcher even when the node path is deleted and it leaks to zookeeper server-side watcher leakages. \r\nThis PR tries to address the leakage issue.\r\n\r\n**Detailed Explanation**\r\n* Current implementation re-installs the watcher explicitly when handling either child or data event\r\n* The updates will re-install the watcher explicitly immediately after receiving the WatchedEvent, if it's NodeDeleted event, no watcher will be set; Then in the actual data handling part, no more explicit watcher will be set.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n(Write a concise description including what, why, how)\r\n**what** \r\nAdd the integration test case to simulate the controller node becomes on/off leader for the test cluster; Also add the case to simulate the leadership switch case.\r\n**why**\r\n- To unblock the progress on PR https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/662 and help us understand the risks  when the leadership switch happens\r\n\r\n| Is controller the leader |  Important checkpoints |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n|Yes | 1. CallBack Handlers are all active and correctly registered 2. The LEADER node on ZK reflects the right leadership ~~3. Controller timer tasks are all active~~ 4. ZK connection is open | \r\n|No  | 1. CallBack Handlers list is empty 2. The LEADER node on ZK is either empty or showing a different leader ~~3. Controller timer tasks are all disabled~~ 4. ZK connection can be open or closed |\r\n\r\n- To help us verify some important properties when the controller is the leader and not the leader\r\n- It also serves a quick easy way to figure out the latency on leader -> standby and standby -> leader\r\n- TODO: There's no good way to check if controller timer tasks are all stopped without adding a public method only for test purpose\r\n- The diff also contains certain code style changes \r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\nTestControllerLeadershipChange\r\n - testControllerConnectThenDisconnect\r\n - testWhenControllerAlreadyExists\r\n - testWhenLeadershipSwitch\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 899, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,819.652 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testForceDeleteJobFromJobQueue(org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue)  Time elapsed: 0.458 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.apache.helix.HelixException: Failed to delete job: testForceDeleteJobFromJobQueue_job2 from queue: testForceDeleteJobFromJobQueue\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue.testForceDeleteJobFromJobQueue(TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue.java:75)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestDeleteJobFromJobQueue.testForceDeleteJobFromJobQueue:75 » Helix Failed to ...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 899, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n\r\n\r\nThe failing test passed when running individually in IDE\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#678\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe validateWeight test methods in TestInstanceAccessor and TestPreInstanceAccessor are testing against the same instance config fields. There was a conflict if both of the test cases are executed in a certain order. This change adds cleanup logic so the shared fields will be empty before each test method starts.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNothing new. Just fixing the tests.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 96, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 31.65 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 96, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #676 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrent zkclient's waitUntilConnected does not return a zk session ID. zkClient's getSessionId() could bring in session race condition: session A is connected in waitUntilConnected, but when zkClient.getSession() is called in zkHelixManager, session A might be already expired and so zkClient.getSession() gets session B. This session ID is critical for the firs time handling new session after zkclient is created in zkHelixManager.\r\n\r\nSolution: add a new method waitForEstablishedSession() to wait for SynCconnected state and return the session id before unlocking the eventLock.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestWaitForEstablishedSession\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nTests all pass.\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 897, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,384.61 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 897, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  56:24 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-01-08T22:38:20-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#[672](https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/672))\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFor distributed systems that use Helix, there is a common request for a mechanism to make sure different processes can cooperate correctly. For example, if two processes that run on different machines, or different networks, or even different data centers would like to work on the same resource, we must have a mutually exclusive lock to secure their operations do not step on each other. Only when a process acquires the lock, it can perform the operation.\r\nTherefore, we want to implement a distributed lock in Helix to benefit clients. This PR adds the new Helix distributed lock module in Helix repo.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nWaiting for time window to expire\r\n\r\nEND TestParticipantMonitor\r\nSTART test at Mon Jan 06 12:19:14 PST 2020\r\nSTART TestZKPathDataDumpTask_test at Mon Jan 06 12:19:14 PST 2020\r\nEND TestZKPathDataDumpTask_test at Mon Jan 06 12:19:14 PST 2020\r\nEND test at Mon Jan 06 12:19:14 PST 2020, took: 204ms.\r\nSTART testCapacityReached at Mon Jan 06 12:19:14 PST 2020\r\nSTART TestZKPathDataDumpTask_testCapacityReached at Mon Jan 06 12:19:14 PST 2020\r\nEND testCapacityReached at Mon Jan 06 12:19:14 PST 2020, took: 221ms.\r\nSTART testBasic at Mon Jan 06 12:19:20 PST 2020\r\nSTART TestHelixConfigAccessor_testBasic at Mon Jan 06 12:19:20 PST 2020\r\nEND TestHelixConfigAccessor_testBasic at Mon Jan 06 12:19:20 PST 2020\r\nEND testBasic at Mon Jan 06 12:19:20 PST 2020, took: 292ms.\r\nSTART testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig at Mon Jan 06 12:19:20 PST 2020\r\nSTART TestHelixConfigAccessor_testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig at Mon Jan 06 12:19:20 PST 2020\r\n3251077 [TestNGInvoker-testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig()] ERROR org.apache.helix.manager.zk.ZKUtil  - Invalid instance setup, missing znode path: /TestHelixConfigAccessor_testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig/CONFIGS/PARTICIPANT/localhost_12918\r\n3251092 [TestNGInvoker-testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig()] ERROR org.apache.helix.manager.zk.ZKUtil  - Invalid instance setup, missing znode path: /TestHelixConfigAccessor_testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig/INSTANCES/localhost_12918/MESSAGES\r\n3251092 [TestNGInvoker-testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig()] ERROR org.apache.helix.manager.zk.ZKUtil  - Invalid instance setup, missing znode path: /TestHelixConfigAccessor_testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig/INSTANCES/localhost_12918/CURRENTSTATES\r\n3251092 [TestNGInvoker-testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig()] ERROR org.apache.helix.manager.zk.ZKUtil  - Invalid instance setup, missing znode path: /TestHelixConfigAccessor_testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig/INSTANCES/localhost_12918/STATUSUPDATES\r\n3251093 [TestNGInvoker-testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig()] ERROR org.apache.helix.manager.zk.ZKUtil  - Invalid instance setup, missing znode path: /TestHelixConfigAccessor_testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig/INSTANCES/localhost_12918/ERRORS\r\nEND TestHelixConfigAccessor_testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig at Mon Jan 06 12:19:20 PST 2020\r\nEND testSetNonexistentParticipantConfig at Mon Jan 06 12:19:20 PST 2020, took: 110ms.\r\nShut down zookeeper at port 2183 in thread main\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 890, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,264.509 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 890, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  54:28 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-01-06T12:19:26-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTestNG cannot handle test classes inheritance well. Some of the tests are skipped with the current design. Move the logic to the new test class so it is no longer a child of another test class. This ensures all the test cases are running.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestAutoRebalance.testAutoRebalance:177 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp:111 Sets differ: expected [testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB8, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB7, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB6, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB5, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB9] but got [testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB4, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB8, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB7, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB6, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB5, testJobQueueAutoCleanUp_JOB9]\r\n[ERROR]   TestZKUtil.testChildrenOperations:80 expected:<2> but was:<4>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1061, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 13, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Code

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #665 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nConfigAccessor is a Helix API used for CRUD access of Helix's data model such as ResourceConfig, InstanceConfig, etc.. These records are represented as ZNRecord and therefore needs to be serialized and deserialized with ZnRecordSerializer. This diff fixes ConfigAccessor so that it explicitly uses ZnRecordSerializer by default.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestConfigAccessor.java (enhanced with creating another ConfigAccessor object with the new constructor that takes in the ZK Address)\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 890, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,205.752 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 890, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  53:34 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-12-19T15:11:49-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #656 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nDuring some of the instantiations of zkClient, the closing of the clients are not guaranteed due to the possible exceptions being thrown before the closing of the clients; in those cases, zkClient leakage happens. I'm adding \"try finally\" clauses to guard against zkClient leakage in these cases.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 887, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,312.299 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testEnableCompressionResource(org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression)  Time elapsed: 122.785 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource(TestEnableCompression.java:108)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring(org.apache.helix.integration.controller.TestControllerLeadershipChange)  Time elapsed: 4.12 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.controller.TestControllerLeadershipChange.testMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring(TestControllerLeadershipChange.java:120)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:108 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestControllerLeadershipChange.testMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring:120 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 887, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  55:16 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-12-13T16:11:21-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun failed tests:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 31.117 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  35.669 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-12-16T16:11:42-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere are usage patterns where a user needs to create ephemeral nodes using a ZkBaseDataAccessor. We need to support this use case since we want users to avoid using ZkClient directly, so we do it in ZkBaseDataAccessor, which is Helix's wrapper API around the raw ZkClient.\r\n\r\nThe default behavior would be to use a shared ZK connection resource.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTests for Dedicated and Shared ZkClients already exist in the repository.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testAlgorithmConstructor:127 expected:<9> but was:<6>\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas(org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:273 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 1\r\n[ERROR]   Run 2: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:273 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 2\r\n[ERROR]   Run 3: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:273 Total movements: 14 != expected 21, replica: 3\r\n[INFO]   Run 4: PASS\r\n[INFO]   Run 5: PASS\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR]   TestRebalanceRunningTask.testFixedTargetTaskAndEnabledRebalanceAndNodeAdded:298 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 883, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 19.178 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestRebalanceRunningTask\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  23.770 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-12-12T08:56:34-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 27, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.469 s - in org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 27, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  5.009 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-12-12T08:58:18-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#[652](https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/652))\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen the participant of Helix is running inside a cloud environment and would like to auto register to its cluster, there are a couple of properties needed, e.g. which function to use to fetch/parse the cloud instance information, what is the source for retrieving cloud instance information, as well as some user defined properties, e.g. http timeout, max retries, etc. We nee to have a globally available Helix Cloud properties defined so that different classes may use it. \r\nThis PR creates a singleton Helix cloud properties factory, and a Helix cloud properties class. In Helix cloud properties, properties are read from different sources and combined to store in the memory. The local properties will be used later by participants and cloud instance information processor.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 895, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,773.486 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testWorkflowFailureJobThreshold(org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestJobFailureDependence)  Time elapsed: 300.015 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.testng.internal.thread.ThreadTimeoutException: Method org.testng.internal.TestNGMethod.testWorkflowFailureJobThreshold() didn't finish within the time-out 300000\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testWorkflowJobFail(org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestWorkflowTermination)  Time elapsed: 10.043 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.apache.helix.HelixException: Workflow \"testWorkflowJobFail\" context is empty or not in states: \"[FAILED]\", current state: \"IN_PROGRESS\"\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestWorkflowTermination.testWorkflowJobFail(TestWorkflowTermination.java:223)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle(org.apache.helix.monitoring.TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle)  Time elapsed: 6.413 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.monitoring.TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle.testClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle(TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle.java:290)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobFailureDependence.testWorkflowFailureJobThreshold » ThreadTimeout Metho...\r\n[ERROR]   TestWorkflowTermination.testWorkflowJobFail:223 » Helix Workflow \"testWorkflow...\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle.testClusterStatusMonitorLifecycle:290 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 895, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Apache Helix 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Apache Helix .......................................

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#650 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis is to get rid of the randomness when the constraint-based evaluation result is a tie. Usually, when the algorithm picks up the nodes with the same score randomly, more partition movements will be triggered. A better strategy is filling the idle nodes (AKA the newly added nodes first). So those assignments won't cause a chain reaction that the other partition placements have to be altered.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nWe are using the same correctness based tests to cover this logic change.\r\nFor the performance-related tests, we will do that in the long run test later. The report will be provided by then.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testAlgorithmConstructor:128 expected:<9> but was:<6>\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas(org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:274 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 1\r\n[ERROR]   Run 2: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:274 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 2\r\n[ERROR]   Run 3: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:274 Total movements: 14 != expected 21, replica: 3\r\n[INFO]   Run 4: PASS\r\n[INFO]   Run 5: PASS\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestZKUtil.testChildrenOperations:78 expected:<2> but was:<3>\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskPerformanceMetrics.testTaskPerformanceMetrics:118 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo.testGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo:63->setupTasks:115 NullPointer\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1048, Failures: 6, Errors: 0, Skipped: 3\r\n\r\nRe-run:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 40, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 37.635 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 40, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nTBD, we will conclude the detail design soon after the algorithm has been tested and finalized.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe add a custom serializer support for ZkSerializer in ZkBaseDataAccessor. But some users might be using PathBasedZkSerializer - we need to add support for a custom PathBasedZkSerializer as well.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo tests needed. Already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testAlgorithmConstructor:127 expected:<9> but was:<6>\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas(org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:273 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 1\r\n[ERROR]   Run 2: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:273 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 2\r\n[ERROR]   Run 3: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:273 Total movements: 14 != expected 21, replica: 3\r\n[INFO]   Run 4: PASS\r\n[INFO]   Run 5: PASS\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR]   TestRebalanceRunningTask.testFixedTargetTaskAndEnabledRebalanceAndNodeAdded:298 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\r\nTestRebalanceRunningTask passed when run independently.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #643 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrent I0ITec IZkStateListener doesn't have an API handleNewSession(sessionId), which is needed for #642\r\nTo avoid creating a new stateListener extends IZkStateListener, it seems better to move IZkStateListener to helix internal. So we would have flexible control to add the new API.\r\n\r\nChangelist:\r\n1. Add new IZkStateListener to helix. The new IZkStateListener has new api handleNewSession(sessionId), and removes handleNewSession()\r\n2. Add tests for this new IZkStateListener.\r\n3. Add session id to ZkEvent as a field.\r\n4. For state change events, pass session id in zk events.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- testSubscribeStateChanges()\r\n- testSessionExpiry()\r\n- testSubscribeStateChangesForI0ItecIZkStateListener()\r\n- testSessionExpiryForI0IItecZkStateListener()\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskRebalancerStopResume.stopDeleteJobAndResumeNamedQueue:199 » Helix Fail...\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 887, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:00 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-12-04T12:38:29-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 10.316 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestJobQueueCleanUp\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 21.841 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestTaskRebalancerStopResume\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #641 \r\n\r\nWhen a storage node's network adapter has issues, network connection is lost, which causes around 5-10 Zookeeper sessions to become expired. Reconnect events are created after the expiration. Eventually this node has 40 minutes busy resetting the storage node's StateModel while helix controller regards this node as online, so helix does not move partitions mastership to other storage node. This caused 40 minutes down time for users of these partitions.\r\n\r\nRoot cause is zk session race condition:\r\nZk session may become expired and change before creating a live instance. So when a live instance(ephemeral node) is being created, if the expected session is expired, we should NOT create the ephemeral node.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nChange list:\r\n1. Change API `create()` in ZkClient to accept zk sessionId as a parameter. Add a new public API createEphemeral(final String path, final Object data, final String sessionId) to create a session aware ephemeral node.\r\n2. Fire a new session event only right after the first SyncConnected is received.\r\n3. Change code logic to handle new session operations that need to be completed in the expected session.\r\n\r\nSome other comments from @lei-xia : https://github.com/pkuwm/helix/pull/1\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestHandleNewSession.testDiscardExpiredSessions\r\nTestHandleNewSession.testSessionExpiredWhenResetHandlers\r\nTestRawZkClient.testConnectionLossWhileCreateEphemeral\r\nTestRawZkClient.testCreateEphemeralWithMismatchedSession\r\nTestRawZkClient.testCreateEphemeralWithValidSession\r\nTestRawZkClient.testRetryUntilConnectedAfterConnectionLoss\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nmvn test at helix-core. \r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 896, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,339.05 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 896, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  55:43 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-01-05T14:19:20-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#563 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPrerequisite of #632 \r\n\r\nThe previous design is that both on-demand and periodic rebalance scheduling task will request for a cache refresh. This won't be always true moving forward.\r\nFor example, the WAGED rebalancer async baseline calculating requests for a scheduled rebalance. But cache refresh won't be necessary.\r\nThis PR does not change any business logic. It prepares for future feature change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nPlease refer to #632 's test result.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#563 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nEnable the Baseline calculation to be asynchronously done.\r\nThis will greatly fasten the rebalance speed. Basically, the WAGED rebalancer will firstly partial rebalance to recover the invalid replica allocations (for example, the ones that are on a disabled instance). Then it calculates the new baseline by global rebalancing.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nMost test cases are still valid to cover this workflow modification. Modify the following two since the assumption is different due to synchronously calculation.\r\nTestMixedModeAutoRebalance\r\nTestMixedModeAutoWagedRebalance\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1058, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 3, Time elapsed: 4,126.389 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1058, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 3\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:08 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-12-19T14:41:07-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/wiki/Weight-aware-Globally-Evenly-distributed-Rebalancer\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSome Helix data access API interfaces have close() method added. However, for users that implement these interfaces may see build failure because their implementations won't have close() implemented. This diff fixes this by ading a default implementation to close().\r\n\r\nChange:\r\n1. Make new close() interface methods a default implementation (a Java 8 feature)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo tests necessary.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nInstead of 'mvn test', build compatibility was checked by running ./build:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Apache Helix .......................................

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #619 , #620 , #621 , #622 , #623 .\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn this commit three test that were unstable for some time has been stabilized.\r\n1- TestWorkflowControllerDataProvider:\r\nThis test were rely on thread sleep. This has been changed to TestHelper.verify.\r\n2-TestDrop:\r\nThis test were rely on thread sleep. This has been changed to TestHelper.verify.\r\n3-TestGetLastScheduledTaskExecInfo:\r\nThis test were rely on thread sleep. This has been changed to TestHelper.verify.\r\nAlso a check has been added to measure the scheduled tasks and compared the\r\nresult with the expected number of tasks that should be scheduled.\r\nAlso in this test some of the hard coded strings for queue naming\r\nhas been removed and replaced with TestHelper.getTestMethodName().\r\n4- TestStopWorkflow:\r\nAt the beginning of each test, participant have started and at the end of the\r\ntest, participants have stopped. Hence dependency between the tests added to\r\navoid potential conflicts between individual tests. Also one global variable\r\nhas been use among the task to stop which has been changed to local variable.\r\nAlso Thread.sleep has been eliminated.\r\n5- TestClusterVerifier:\r\nThis test were rely on thread sleep. This has been changed to TestHelper.verify.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nTest Result 1: mvn test\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 886, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,286.007 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 886, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  54:51 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-11-20T10:10:53-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #610 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe want to make WAGED rebalancer (weight-aware) easier to use. One way to do this is to allow the user to easily add resources with weight configuration set by providing REST endpoints. This change adds the relevant REST endpoints based on the HelixAdmin APIs added in (https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/570).\r\n\r\nBasically, this commit uses existing REST endpoints whose hierarchy is defined by REST resource. What this commit does to the existing endpoints is 1) Add extra commands 2) Add a WAGED command as a QueryParam so that WAGED logic could be included.\r\n\r\nThis change is backward-compatible because it keeps the original behavior when no commands are provided by using @DefaultValue annotation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestValidateWeightForAllInstances\r\ntestAddResourceWithWeight\r\ntestValidateResource\r\ntestValidateWeightForInstance\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n$ /helix-rest/mvn test\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 91, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 20.809 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 91, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #607  \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn this PR, the TestAlertingRebalancerFailure has been stabilized. This test was unstable because there were some race condition between two tests (cleanup of testParticipantUnavailable and start of the testTagSetIncorrect). Due to this race condition, the listfield and mapfield in the IdealState have been missing for the testTagSetIncorrect test. Hence, rebalancer does not run as expected.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nmvn test has been run several time to make sure TestAlertingRebalancerFailure does not fail.\r\n\r\nTest Result 1: mvn test\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 886, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,503.711 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testDifferentTasks(org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestIndependentTaskRebalancer)  Time elapsed: 1.328 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestIndependentTaskRebalancer.testDifferentTasks(TestIndependentTaskRebalancer.java:146)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestIndependentTaskRebalancer.testDifferentTasks:146 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 886, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  58:28 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-11-15T11:27:23-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTest Result 2: mvn test -Dtest=\"TestIndependentTaskRebalancer\"\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 14.432 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestIndependentTaskRebalancer\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  19.394 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-11-15T13:57:59-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #593 \r\nResolves #594 \r\nResolves #595 \r\nResolves #596 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn order to allow users to avoid having to create, manage, and close a HelixZkClient instance when using Helix data access APIs, we add new constructors and close() methods. The new constructors will allow for instantiation purely based on a ZkAddress, and internally, either Shared or Dedicated HelixZkClient will be used.\r\n\r\nAlso, the close() method ensures that we only close if we generated a ZkClient internally. External ZkClients, we can't close arbitrarily because they could be used in other active Helix APIs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo additional tests required - no new logic added.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testAlgorithmConstructor:128 expected:<9> but was:<6>\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas(org.apache.helix.controller.strategy.crushMapping.TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:274 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 1\r\n[ERROR]   Run 2: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:274 Total movements: 4 != expected 8, replica: 2\r\n[ERROR]   Run 3: TestCardDealingAdjustmentAlgorithmV2.testComputeMappingForDifferentReplicas:274 Total movements: 14 != expected 21, replica: 3\r\n[INFO]   Run 4: PASS\r\n[INFO]   Run 5: PASS\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR]   TestAlertingRebalancerFailure.testTagSetIncorrect:174->checkResourceBestPossibleCalFailureState:310 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 882, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  57:28 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2019-11-14T19:44:05-08:00\r\n\r\n------\r\nTwo tests pass when run individually.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using
