changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.14.2 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: corrected a potential case of the parser input stream not being closed immediately on a read exception.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when making a HTTP POST, if the request write fails, make sure the connection is immediately cleaned up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: updated the HtmlTreeParser resetInsertionMode to the current spec for supported elements\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1491\">jhy/jsoup#1491</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix [Fuzz]: fixed a slow parse when a tag has thousands of null characters in it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1580\">jhy/jsoup#1580</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix [Fuzz]: the adoption agency algorithm can have an incorrect bookmark position\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1576\">jhy/jsoup#1576</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfiz [Fuzz]: malformed HTML could result in null elements on stack\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1579\">jhy/jsoup#1579</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.14.1 [2021-Jul-10]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Change: updated the minimum supported Java version from Java 7 to Java 8.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Change: updated the minimum Android API level from 8 to 10.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Change: although Node#childNodes() returns an UnmodifiableList as a view into its children, it was still\ndirectly backed by the internal child list. That made some uses, such as looping and moving those children to\nanother element, throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Now this method returns its own list so that they are\nseparated and changes to the parent's contents will not impact the children view. This aligns with similar methods\nsuch as Element#children(). If you have code that iterates this list and makes parenting changes to its contents,\nyou may need to make a code update.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1431\">jhy/jsoup#1431</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Change: the org.jsoup.Connection interface has been modified to introduce new methods for sessions and the cookie\nstore. If you have a custom implementation of this interface, you will need to add implementations of these methods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added HTTP request session management support with Jsoup.newSession(). This extends the Connection\nimplementation to support (optional) sessions, which allow request defaults (timeout, proxy, etc) to be set once and\nthen applied to all requests within that session.</p>\n<p>Cookies are re-implemented to correctly support path and domain filtering when used within a session. A default\nin-memory cookie store is used for the session, or a custom implementation (perhaps disk-persistent, or pre-set)\ncan be used instead.</p>\n<p>Forms submitted using the FormElement#submit() use the same session that was used to fetch the document and so pass\ncookies and other defaults appropriately.</p>\n<p>The session is multi-thread safe and can execute multiple requests concurrently. If the user accidentally tries to\nexecute the same request object across multiple threads (vs calling Connection#newRequest()),\nthat is detected cleanly and a clear exception is thrown (vs weird blowups in input stream reading, or forcing\neverything through a synchronized bottleneck.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/releases\">jib-maven-plugin's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>jib-maven-plugin v3.1.0</h2>\n<h3>Major Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For Google Artifact Registry (<code>*-docker.pkg.dev</code>), Jib now tries <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials\">Google Application Default Credentials</a> last like it has been doing for <code>gcr.io</code>. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3241\">#3241</a>)</li>\n<li>Jib now creates an additional layer that contains two small text files: <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin/README.md#custom-container-entrypoint\"><code>/app/jib-classpath-file</code> and <code>/app/jib-main-class-file</code></a>. They hold, respectively, the final Java runtime classpath and the main class computed by Jib that are suitable for app execution on JVM. For example, with Java 9+, setting the container entrypoint to <code>java --class-path @/app/jib-classpath-file @/app/jib-main-class-file</code> will work to start the app. (This is basically the default entrypoint set by Jib when the entrypoint is not explicitly configured by the user.) The files are always generated whether Java 8 or 9+, or whether <code>jib.container.entrypoint</code> is explicitly configured. The files can be helpful especially when setting a custom entrypoint for a shell script that needs to get the classpath and the main class computed by Jib, or for <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/2471\">AppCDS</a>. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3280\">#3280</a>)</li>\n<li>For Java 9+ apps, the default Java runtime classpath explicitly lists all the app dependencies, preserving the dependency loading order declared by Maven. This is done by changing the default entrypoint to use the new classpath JVM argument file (basically <code>java -cp @/app/jib-classpath-file</code>). As such, <code>&lt;container&gt;&lt;expandClasspathDependencies&gt;</code> takes no effect for Java 9+. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/pull/3280\">#3280</a>)</li>\n<li>Timestamps of file entries in a tarball built with <code>jib:buildTar</code> are set to the epoch, making the tarball reproducible. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/issues/3158\">#3158</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/blob/master/jib-maven-plugin/CHANGELOG.md\">CHANGELOG.md</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>jib-gradle-plugin v3.1.0</h2>\n<h3>Major Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For Google Artifact Registry (<code>*-docker.pkg.dev</code>), Jib now tries <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials\">Google Application Default Credentials</a> last like it has been doing for <code>gcr.io</code>.
