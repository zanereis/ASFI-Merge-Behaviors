docstring for the Python `WriteToBigquery` PTransform only mentions that `additional_bq_parameters` can be a callable while it can also be a `dict` (as shown in [the example at the top of the file](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/c1719476b74ec6f68fabea392087607adafc70ef/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery.py#L177-L188)). This is also reflected in some other docstrings that include `additional_bq_parameters` ([example](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/c1719476b74ec6f68fabea392087607adafc70ef/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery.py#L712)).\r\n\r\nI believe that for load jobs, it can also be a `ValueProvider` ([code](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/c1719476b74ec6f68fabea392087607adafc70ef/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery_file_loads.py#L394)), but not for streaming inserts. So wasn't sure whether to include this.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

relies deleteTimer(TimerData timerData) as its final implementation to delete timers, however this is a deprecated because of the timestamp value inside TimerData during deletion is not set/reliable. Therefore following changes has been made:\r\n\r\n1. Update SamzaTimerInternalsFactory#deleteTimer to depend on key fields only, i.e. StateNamespace, TimerId, TimerFamilyId and TimeDomain.\r\n2. Read from state on timestamp and output timestamp in order to properly delete.\r\n3. Enable test_pardo_timers_clear tests to test the cases where timers are supposed to be cleared/deleted\r\n4. Refactor interfaces to better organize the code.\r\n\r\nTested with `./gradlew :sdks:python:test-suites:portable:py36:samzaCompatibilityMatrixLOOPBACK --rerun-tasks`\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the ability to prevent infinite retries with non-transient Elasticsearch write failures by providing a user-configurable setting called (for now, I'm not certain the name is perfect) `withThrowWriteFailures`, which is `true` by default to maintain backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nIf `withThrowWriteFailures` is set to `false`, the response from Elasticsearch Bulk API will be used to capture the result of persisting a document (or deleting it). The order of Bulk API response is guaranteed to be in the same order as the Bulk API request[1], so we can stitch together what the write result of a given input document was.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new class `WriteSummary`. This class is used to collect the context of a document as it passes from raw input document (i.e. the PCollection being sent to ElasticsearchIO.Write/ElasticsearchIO.DocToBulk), the Bulk Directive which resulted from transform settings and the input document (ex. delete directive, upsert, scripted upsert, etc), as well as whether the document resulted in an error from ES. By maintaining all the context/ancestry of the document, users can get at the input document and its resulting error, for example. Without maintaining the ancestry, we could only return the Bulk Directive which would be less helpful in many cases.\r\n\r\n[1] https://discuss.elastic.co/t/ordering-of-responses-in-the-bulk-api/13264\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

are various use cases that can be implemented on top of Beam and its runners, but that need certain guarantees regarding the ordered transport of data in between execution stages/steps of a Beam Pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the following:\r\n- Defining the concept of per-key ordered delivery.\r\n- `ValidatesRunner` tests that allow us to verify runner behavior for per-key ordered delivery.\r\n- Adding a row to the Beam Capability Matrix where runner support for this is documented.\r\n\r\nWith this, Beam users will be able to enable various order-dependent workloads on Beam/Dataflow with confidence that they need.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nResults form ValidatesRunner tests:\r\n\r\n- Flink streaming VR tests: [Build

Adds Go SDK containers back to the release scripts.\r\n* Have released versions of the Go SDK use the matching container.\r\n \r\nOnly issues are around release validation: we don't update that string manually, so release validation users will need to manually specify the RC container when validating Go SDK releases. Similarly, SDK developers will likely need to manually specify the \"latest\" container, as the dev builds aren't guaranteed to exist (not all devs need/want to modify the boot container code.)\r\n\r\nTest scripts all presently pass in containers manually so this doesn't change that, only when a container is not provided.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

SDFBoundedSourceReader was running extremely slowly, especially for `ReadFromBigQuery` pipelines that had many splits (1TB returns ~5k splits - this was giving us an overhead of 1000 seconds vs alternatives).\r\n\r\nAfter debugging, I figured out that `SDFBoundedSourceReader` implementation along with SDF expansion (`PairWithRestriction -> InitialSplits -> ProcessSplits`) was causing us to pickle-encode custom `BoundedSource` instances repeatedly. For BQ, this was `_CustomBigQuerySource` being pickled once for every split (for thousands of splits), so this was adding up.\r\n\r\nI created a pickle coder that memoizes results, and used it (so far) only in this transform. This allowed us to reduce the cost of repeatedly encoding the sources. This should fix other instances of the same issue (e.g. https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15185).\r\n\r\nr: @robertwb \r\n\r\nfyi @satybald @chunyang \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

involves additional GCS metadata operations.\r\nThe existing filtering in FileSystems skips the rename if the destination exists and the checksum matches.  However such existence is not the common case, and the rewrite operation is metadata only if the object is within the same location and storage class.

recently published a 2.0.0 release which removed support for Python 2.7. `google-auth` now requires Python >=3.6. No other breaking changes were made. You can see the full list of changes [here](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python/commit/560cf1ed02a900436c5d9e0a0fb3f94b5fd98c55).\r\n\r\nI am opening PRs to expand google-auth version ranges for packages that meet either of the following criteria:\r\n* Package has >10,000 monthly downloads as of June 2021\r\n* Package is owned by a Google team\r\n\r\n`google-auth` is a dependency of many different libraries that interact with Google APIs. Increasing the time and number of packages with compatible pins on `google-auth` lowers the chance end developers who use multiple libraries will see dependency conflicts. \r\n\r\nIf possible, please do not require `google-auth>=2.0.0` until this issue is resolved\r\nhttps://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/issues/10566, as that will further reduce the likelihood of diamond dependency conflicts.\r\n\r\nGooglers, see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1euAvUsia_4zf98lNvpwA3K0o2b4y5Xr9xAkyzCnIMzQ/edit) for more information.\r\n\r\nR: @tvalentyn \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the release notes for Beam 2.31, there were two deprecations mentioned that affect GroupByKey in the Python SDK:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Python GBK will stop supporting unbounded PCollections that have global windowing and a default trigger in Beam 2.33. This can be overriden with `--allow_unsafe_triggers`. ([BEAM-9487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9487)).\r\n* Python GBK will start requiring safe triggers or the `--allow_unsafe_triggers` flag starting with Beam 2.33. ([BEAM-9487](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9487)).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR making that change in anticipation of the upcoming Beam 2.33 release.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adds two improvements to the PipelineOptionFactory command line parser:\r\n- Failure to parse complex types due to missing quotes is retried with the input automatically quoted\r\n- @JsonDeserialize is now supported on getters, the specified deserializer in the annotation will be used to parse the input string.\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik @kennknowles since you two are the last to make any changes

can be optimized to only call getValue once per field, rather than twice that it does now.\r\n\r\nCurrently it'll call getValue once in scanNullFields to find if the field is null, and then another time to actually encode the value.  This can add unnecessary overhead if `getValue` needs to do expensive operations to transform the wrapped value to a beam Row value (for example, recursively translating a map or Row).\r\n\r\nR: @TheNeuralBit @reuvenlax \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds module support to the Go SDK. Currently it is split into multiple commits, and **I strongly suggest reviewing it one commit at a time**. The commits are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Go modules basic support and upgrade to Go 1.16.5.\r\n- This is the addition of basic module support, along with getting gogradle to work with modules.\r\n- I placed the module in the /sdks subdirectory. While my first instinct was to put it in the root directory, this didn't play well with the /vendor subdirectory.\r\n- This commit does not update the module to /v2 yet, although that's required. I saved that for a separate commit.\r\n2. Go Jenkins tests adjusted to use modules.\r\n- This does some fixup to the gradle files and adjusts the validates runner test script to (hopefully) work on Jenkins. Whether it works we'll find out when we run postcommits on this PR.\r\n3. Add /v2/ to go module path and update references.\r\n- This commit adds v2 to the module path and attempts to update all references. Basically just a lot of search and replace. I may have missed some spots but it will probably be easier to find out through usage.\r\n- I avoided changing references outside of the module as much as I could. So things like the website and katas are not updated.\r\n4. Fix Go SDK proto generation, and update protos.\r\n- I had to make some fixes to proto generation to account for the addition of /v2/ to the module path. While I was at it I ended up updating the version of protoc-gen-go used and updated the instructions.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
