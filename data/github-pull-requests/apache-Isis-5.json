<code>InetAddress</code>-<code>String</code> conversion methods to preserve the IPv6 scope ID if present. The scope ID can be necessary for IPv6-capable devices with multiple network interfaces. However, preserving it can also lead to problems for callers that rely on the returned values <em>not</em> to include the scope ID:\n<ul>\n<li>Callers might compensate for the old behavior of the methods by appending the scope ID to a returned string themselves. If so, you can update your code to stop doing so at the same time as you upgrade Guava. Of, if your code might run against multiple versions of Guava, you can check whether Guava has included a scope ID before you add one yourself.</li>\n<li>Callers might pass the returned string to another system that does not understand scope IDs. If so, you can strip the scope ID off, whether by truncating the string form at a <code>%</code> character (leaving behind any trailing <code>]</code> character in the case of <code>forUriString</code>) or by replacing the returned <code>InetAddress</code> with a new instance constructed by calling <code>InetAddress.getByAddress(addr)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>java.net.InetAddress</code> validates any provided scope ID against the interfaces available on the machine. As a result, methods in <code>InetAddresses</code> may now fail if the scope ID fails validation.\n<ul>\n<li>Notable cases in which this may happen include:\n<ul>\n<li>if the code runs in an Android app without networking permission</li>\n<li>if code passes <code>InetAddress</code> instances or strings across devices</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If this is not the behavior that you want, then you can strip off the scope ID from the input string before passing it to Guava, as discussed above.

<code>InetAddress</code>-<code>String</code> conversion methods to preserve the IPv6 scope ID if present. The scope ID can be necessary for IPv6-capable devices with multiple network interfaces. However, preserving it can also lead to problems for callers that rely on the returned values <em>not</em> to include the scope ID:\n<ul>\n<li>Callers might compensate for the old behavior of the methods by appending the scope ID to a returned string themselves. If so, you can update your code to stop doing so at the same time as you upgrade Guava. Of, if your code might run against multiple versions of Guava, you can check whether Guava has included a scope ID before you add one yourself.</li>\n<li>Callers might pass the returned string to another system that does not understand scope IDs. If so, you can strip the scope ID off, whether by truncating the string form at a <code>%</code> character (leaving behind any trailing <code>]</code> character in the case of <code>forUriString</code>) or by replacing the returned <code>InetAddress</code> with a new instance constructed by calling <code>InetAddress.getByAddress(addr)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>java.net.InetAddress</code> validates any provided scope ID against the interfaces available on the machine. As a result, methods in <code>InetAddresses</code> may now fail if the scope ID fails validation.\n<ul>\n<li>Notable cases in which this may happen include:\n<ul>\n<li>if the code runs in an Android app without networking permission</li>\n<li>if code passes <code>InetAddress</code> instances or strings across devices</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If this is not the behavior that you want, then you can strip off the scope ID from the input string before passing it to Guava, as discussed above.

know of Guava Android users who have not yet upgraded to at least release <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v33.0.0\">33.0.0</a>, please encourage them to upgrade, preferably to today's release, 33.2.0. These releases have begun adding Java 8+ APIs to <code>guava-android</code>. While we don't anticipate problems, we do anticipate that any unexpected problems could force a disruptive rollback.

(858caf425c)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made our <code>Collector</code> APIs (e.g., <code>ImmutableList.toImmutableList()</code>) available in <code>guava-android</code>. More <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6567\">Java 8 APIs</a> will follow in future releases.

(But note that we test only with library desugaring, so we don't <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/7197\">currently</a> know if API Level 24 is high enough to use our <code>Collector</code> APIs unless you have also enabled library desugaring.) Guava users who <em>avoid</em> the <code>Collector</code> APIs do <em>not</em> need to meet this requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Fixed a potential <code>NullPointerException</code> in <code>ImmutableMap.Builder</code> on a rare code path. (70a98115d8)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constants <code>Ad-Auction-Allowed</code>, <code>Permissions-Policy-Report-Only</code>, and <code>Sec-GPC</code>.
