[KAFKA-13563](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13563)\r\n\r\nAfter KAFKA-10793, we clear the findCoordinatorFuture in 2 places:\r\n\r\n    1. heartbeat thread\r\n    2. AbstractCoordinator#ensureCoordinatorReady\r\n\r\nBut in non consumer group mode with group id provided (for offset commitment. So that there will be consumerCoordinator created), there will be no (1)heartbeat thread , and it only call (2)AbstractCoordinator#ensureCoordinatorReady when 1st time consumer wants to fetch committed offset position. That is, after 2nd lookupCoordinator call, we have no chance to clear the findCoordinatorFuture , and causes the offset commit never succeeded.\r\n\r\n \r\nTo avoid the race condition as KAFKA-10793 mentioned, it's not safe to clear the findCoordinatorFuture in the future listener. So, I think we can fix this issue by calling AbstractCoordinator#ensureCoordinatorReady when coordinator unknown in non consumer group case, under each ConsumerCoordinator#poll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Resolve the bootstrap server when cluster metadata hasn't been refreshed for a long time\r\n    \r\nThis patch adds a config li.client.cluster.metadata.expire.time.ms which controls the max time cluster metadata can remain unchanged. On NetworkClient.poll, if this \r\ntimeout has been reached and the client has tried half of the nodes in the original cached node set and failed, it will try to resolve the bootstrap servers again and us\r\ne the newly resolved nodes to pick a leastLoadedNode to send updateMetadataRequest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is to avoid following two scenarios:\r\n    \r\nconsumer has been idle for a long time, and whole cluster has been swapped. This case, all the cached nodes are invalid and resolve bootstrap is needed.\r\nconsumer hasn't refreshed metadata for a long time and some brokers in the cluster had been moved to another cluster, and the client randomly picks up the moved broker to send md request and get a response for a different cluster. In this case, we simply reject the stale md response and resolve bootstrap when conditions are met.\r\nTICKET =\r\nLI_DESCRIPTION = LIKAFKA-40759,\r\nEXIT_CRITERIA = MANUAL this is not going to merged with upstream\r\n\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix.

to resource leaks in the `NioEchoServer`, at times it won't start properly to accept clients and will throw an exception in the `ServerSocketChannel.accept()` call. Previous to this change, the error was not being logged. The logged error was that there were too many open files.\r\n\r\nUsing the `UnixOperatingSystemMXBean`, I was able to detect that use of the `NioEchoServer` creates several file descriptors but does not close them. This then caused the client to never be able to connect to the server, so the waitForCondition failed intermittently.\r\n\r\nThis change closes the internal `Selector` and the `AcceptorThread`'s selector so that the file descriptors are reclaimed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

fully consumed.\r\nCurrently, this is done every time the Task is committed, resulting in\r\n\"delete records\" requests being sent every `commit.interval.ms`\r\nmilliseconds.\r\n\r\nWhen `commit.interval.ms` is set very low, for example when\r\n`processing.guarantee` is set to `exactly_once_v2`, this causes delete\r\nrecords requests to be sent extremely frequently, potentially reducing\r\nthroughput and causing a high volume of log messages to be logged by the\r\nbrokers.\r\n\r\nDisconnecting delete records requests from the commit interval resolves\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\nWe now only explicitly delete records for a repartition topic when we\r\ncommit, if it's been at least `repartition.purge.interval.ms` milliseconds\r\nsince the last time we deleted records.\r\n\r\nBecause we still require a commit to trigger record deletion, the\r\nlower-bound of `repartition.purge.interval.ms` is effectively capped at\r\nthe `commit.interval.ms`.\r\n\r\nFor compatibility, the default `repartition.purge.interval.ms` is set to\r\n30 seconds, the same as the default `commit.interval.ms`. Users who have\r\nconfigured a different `commit.interval.ms` may need to review and\r\nchange `repartition.purge.interval.ms`.\r\n\r\nUnlike `commit.interval.ms`, we don't dynamically change the default for\r\n`repartition.purge.interval.ms` when EOS processing is enabled, as it's\r\nimportant not to flood brokers with the record deletions, and we want a\r\nsensible default.\r\n\r\nThis code is my own work and is licensed to the Apache Kafka project under the terms of the same license (ASL 2) as the project itself.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [X]

PR fixed the iterator access issue during segment flush where a NoSuchElementException may be thrown. This can particularly happen if the Iterable[LogSegment] is accessed by 2 threads in parallel. A particular case is when retention periodic work empties segments from the segments map, while concurrently the async flush operation tries to access the very last segment from the same map. Since Iterable[T].lastOption is not thread-safe, the parallel access sometimes fails with a NoSuchElementException.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

source of flakiness we found in the NamedTopologyIntegrationTest was an ocasional MissingSourceTopicException that was causing the application to shut down. We created all source topics ahead of time in the tests, leading us to discover this [race condition](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13543) in the consumer client which can lead to spurious MissingSourceTopicExceptions when the metadata hasn't finished updating after a change in the consumer's subscription.\r\n\r\nIn addition to finding a workaround for this bug, throwing this MissingSourceTopicException and shutting down the entire app is itself a bug in the NamedTopology feature -- we should not stop all clients and prevent any further processing of the completely valid topologies just because one (or more) topologies were added that are missing their source topics. We can just remove those topologies from the assignment for the time being, and wait until the metadata has finished updating or the user has created the input topics to start assigning tasks from them.\r\n\r\nThis work entails two things:\r\na) Avoid throwing a MissingSourceTopicException inside the #assign method when named topologies are used, and just remove those topologies which are missing any of their input topics from the assignment. \r\nb) Trigger the uncaught exception handler with a MissingSourceTopicException for each of the topologies that are missing topics, but don't shut down the thread -- we just want to make sure this issue is made visible to the user.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses (a), while (b) is done in the followup PR

server fails SSL handshake and closes its connection, we attempt to report this to clients on a best-effort basis. When IOException is detected in the client, we may proceed to close the connection before processing all the data from the server if we have data pending to be sent to the server. Server attempts to send any data that has been already wrapped, but may not wrap again after handshake failure, so error may not be propagated to clients. However, our tests assume that clients always detect  handshake failures. This PR attempts to wrap and send all data on the server-side after handshake failure and attempts to process all data on the client-side.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

experimenting with what would happen if we pass serdes around and just skip translating data in the Metered stores at all.\r\n\r\nI think this winds up being a little messy because didn't want to build in `K` and `V` type bounds on the query, so there's no bound on the serde types either, which means that both the store's query handler and the user of IQ have to cast after de/serialization.\r\n\r\nThere also doesn't seem to be a way to generalize the notion of a \"lazily deserialized result\", since the object returned by a query may not be a plain value, but it might be an Iterator of values, or a Future value, etc.\r\n\r\nI might have just wound up on the wrong track here, though, so I'm going to take a break and come back later to see if I have better ideas.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

The `ConfigResource` class is made up of two fields,\r\nname and type of entity. Kafka returns all configurations for the\r\nentities provided to the admin client api.\r\n\r\nThis admin api in turn uses `DescribeConfigsRequest` kafka api to get the\r\nconfiguration for the entities in question. In addition to name and type\r\nof entity whose configuration to get, Kafka `DescribeConfigsResource`\r\nstructure also lets users provide `ConfigurationKeys` list, which allows\r\nusers to fetch only the configurations that are needed.\r\n\r\nHowever, this field isn't exposed in the `ConfigResource` class that is\r\nused by `AdminClient`, so users of `AdminClient` have no way to ask for\r\nspecific configuration. The API always returns all configurations. Then\r\nthe user of the `AdminClient::describeConfigs` go over the returned list\r\nand filter out the config keys that they are interested in.\r\n\r\nThis results in boilerplate code for all users of\r\n`AdminClient::describeConfigs` api, in addition to  being wasteful use of\r\nresource. It becomes painful in large cluster case where to fetch one\r\nconfiguration of all topics, we need to fetch all configuration of all\r\ntopics, which can be huge in size.\r\n\r\nCreating this Jira to add same field (i.e. `ConfigurationKeys`) to the\r\n`ConfigResource` structure to bring it to parity to\r\n`DescribeConfigsResource` Kafka API structure. There should be no backward\r\ncompatibility issue as the field will be optional and will behave same\r\nway if it is not specified (i.e. by passing null to backend kafka api)\r\n\r\nAdded unit and integration test to test the behavior.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

the SMT TimestampConverter can convert Timestamp from either source String, Long or Date into target String, Long or Date.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Long source or target is required to be epoch in milliseconds.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, epoch is represented with different precisions. This leads to several Jira tickets :\r\n\r\n[KAFKA-12364](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12364): add support for date from int32 to timestampconverter\r\n[KAFKA-10561](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10561): Support microseconds precision for Timestamps\r\nI propose to add a new config to TimestampConverter called \"epoch.precision\" which defaults to \"millis\" so as to not impact existing code, and allows for more precisions : seconds, millis, micros.\r\n````json\r\n\"transforms\": \"TimestampConverter\",\r\n\"transforms.TimestampConverter.type\": \"org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.TimestampConverter$Value\",\r\n\"transforms.TimestampConverter.field\": \"event_date\",\r\n\"transforms.TimestampConverter.epoch.precision\": \"micros\",\r\n\"transforms.TimestampConverter.target.type\": \"Timestamp\"\r\n````\r\nExactly like \"format\" field which is used as input when the source in String and output when the target.type is string, this new field would be used as input when the field is Long, and as output when the target.type is \"unix\"\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-07T15:41:40Z","updated_at":"2022-02-22T16:17:16Z","closed_at":"2022-02-22T16:17:16Z","merged_at":"2022-02-22T16:17:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"a5bb45c11ad7a68856d14c86184bc3488770aa43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2129035451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTI5MDM1NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kip","name":"kip","color":"a01d16","default":false,"description":"Requires

4.1.0 caused unsupported version error during gradle builds.\r\nThe reason was that grgit 4.1.0 uses always the latest JGit version\r\ninternally. Unfortunately, the latest JGit version was compiled with\r\na Java version later than Java 8 which caused the unsupported version\r\nerror during gradle builds for Java 8.\r\n\r\ngrgit 4.1.1 fixed this issue by upper bounding the version of JGrit\r\nto a version that is still compiled with Java 8. Consequently, we can\r\nremove the hotfix we merged in PR #11554 \r\nand instead bump the grgit version from 4.1.0 to 4.1.1.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]
