JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14829\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nCurrently, we have various bits of reassignment logic spread across different classes. For example, `ReplicationControlManager` contains logic for when a reassignment is in progress, which is duplication in `PartitionChangeBuilder`. Another example is `PartitionReassignmentRevert` which contains logic for how to undo/revert a reassignment. The idea here is to move the logic to `PartitionReassignmentReplicas` so it's more testable and easier to reason about.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

out KRaft controller metrics into two groups: metrics directly managed by the QuorumController, and metrics handled by an external publisher. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to reason about, by clarifying what metrics can be changed where.\r\n\r\nThe external publisher, ControllerMetadataMetricsPublisher, handles all metrics which are related to the content of metadata. For example, metrics about number of topics or number of partitions, etc. etc. It fits into the MetadataLoader metadata publishing framework as another publisher.  Since ControllerServerMetricsPublisher operates off of a MetadataImage, we don't have to create (essentially) another copy of the metadata in memory, as ControllerMetricsManager. This reduces memory consumption. Another benefit of operating off of the MetadataImage is that we don't have to have special handling for each record type, like we do now in

StandardAuthorizer uses a R/W lock for maintaining the consistency of data. For the clusters with very high traffic, we will typically see an increase in latencies whenever a write operation comes. The intent of this PR is to get rid of the R/W lock with the help of immutable or persistent collections. Basically, new object references are used to hold the intermediate state of the write operation. After the completion of the operation, the main reference to the cache is changed to point to the new object. Also, for the read operation, the code is changed such that all accesses to the cache for a single read operation are done to a particular cache object only.\r\n\r\nIn another [PR](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13280), new persistent libraries ([Paguro](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/Paguro/) and [Vavr](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr)) have been evaluated to improve the performance of Kraft metadata image change performance. That PR favors Vavr over Paguro. \r\n\r\nIn the description below, you can find the performance of various libraries at the time of both read and write. Read performance is checked with the existing `AuthorizerBenchmark`. For write performance, a new `AuthorizerUpdateBenchmark` has been added which evaluates the performance of the `addAcl` operation.\r\n\r\n# How to ensure data consistency for read calls\r\nThe main reason for having a lock here was to ensure that all read calls to Acl Cache (`aclsById` and `aclsByResource`) that happen for a particular authorizer() call don't go to different versions for these objects. Since writes are done on a single thread, the only case of concurrency we have to solve here is when multiple reads and a single write are happening in parallel. \r\n\r\nNow to ensure consistency of reads, we need to do the following two things:\r\n1. For writes, we create a new copy of `aclsByResource` and `aclsById` with the latest update and we create a new instance of AclCache with these new objects and replace the main reference in the cache only after both `aclsByResource` and `aclsById` are in a consistent state with each other.\r\n2. For reads, copy the reference to the cache in an intermediate variable and use that only for all read accesses needed for this particular authorize() or other read API call. \r\n\r\n# Why prefer persistent collections over immutable?\r\nA simple difference between the two can be found [here](https://github.com/hrldcpr/pcollections#persistent-versus-unmodifiable). Since immutable or copy-on-write collections for updates require creating a copy of the collection, this becomes a very expensive operation. However persistent collections do it quite efficiently. For example, for adding a node to a persistent TreeMap, only the root node along with the nodes present on the path where the new node was added have to be updated. Rest all nodes are shared between two versions. When we no longer require the older version, the old nodes get garbage collected.\r\n\r\nSince the authorizer is quite read-heavy with very infrequent writes, it makes sense to optimize it for the same.\r\n\r\n# Library Comparison (TLDR)\r\n\r\n⚠️ Note - There are two bugs in the TreeSet code of Paguro. Following results are computed after fixing those bugs in local.\r\n\r\n## AuthorizerUpdateBenchmark.testAddAcl\r\n\r\n| Library | ms/op | error |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| PCollections | 9.751 | 2.633 |\r\n| Paguro | 0.509 | 1.108 |\r\n| Vavr | 1.515 | 0.995 |\r\n\r\n## AuthorizerBenchmark.testAclsIterator\r\n\r\n| (aclCount) | (authorizerType) | (denyPercentage) | (resourceCount) | ms/op | Error |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| 50 | ACL | 20 | 50000 | 186.399 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(Existing Code) | 20 | 50000 | 218.633 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(PCollections) | 20 | 50000 | 208.878 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(Paguro) | 20 | 50000 | 289.411 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(Vavr) | 20 | 50000 | 277.919 | |\r\n\r\n\r\n## AuthorizerBenchmark.testAuthorizeByResourceType\r\n\r\n| (aclCount) | (authorizerType) | (denyPercentage) | (resourceCount) | ms/op | Error |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| 50 | ACL | 20 | 50000 | 0.005 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(Existing Code) | 20 | 50000 | 486.814 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(PCollections) | 20 | 50000 | 509.253 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(Paguro) | 20 | 50000 | 1048.940 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(Vavr) | 20 | 50000 | 3406.584 | |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## AuthorizerBenchmark.testAuthorize\r\n\r\n| (aclCount) | (authorizerType) | (denyPercentage) | (resourceCount) | ms/op | Error |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| 50 | ACL | 20 | 50000 | 0.244 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(Existing Code) | 20 | 50000 | 0.750 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(PCollections) | 20 | 50000 | 0.785 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(Paguro) | 20 | 50000 | 3751.478 | |\r\n| 50 | KRAFT(Vavr) | 20 | 50000 | 3465.406 | |\r\n\r\n\r\n⚠️ - Read performance of Paguro is worst than pcollections because of inefficient implementation of the `tailSet()` function. In Paguro, it is an O(n) operation however in `pcollections` it is an O(log(n)) operation. \r\n\r\n⚠️ - Vavr doesn't implement Java's SortedSet interface and it doesn't expose any API equivalent to [SortedSet.tailSet()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html#tailSet-E-). So, it is required to convert the vavr's TreeSet into Java equivalent, which is an O(n) operation, and then call `tailSet` over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n| | PCollections | Paguro | Vavr |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| Implements Java native collection interfaces | ✅  | ✅  | ❗ (Provides adaptors to convert to Java, which in case of TreeSet are not efficient) |\r\n| Read Performance | ✅ (Similar to Existing code) | ❌ (5000x of Existing code) | ❌  (4500x of Existing code) |\r\n| Write Performance | ⚠️ (10x of Paguro) | ✅  (best) | ✅  (4x of Paguro) |\r\n| Library Completeness | ✅ (HashMap, HashSet, TreeMap, TreeSet, OrderList, OrderedSet, OrderedMap, Stack, Queue) | ⚠️ (HashMap, HashSet, TreeMap, TreeSet, List) | ✅ (most complete - Array, List, Vector, HashMap, HashSet, LinkedHashMap, LinkedHashSet, PriorityQueue, TreeMap, TreeSet) |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\nSince the read time performance is better for pcollections compared to Vavr or Paguro, for StandardAuthorizer it makes sense to go ahead with it. But for Kraft metadata image change patch, `pcollections` was [not considered](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13280#issuecomment-1442082585) because of performance concerns explained on this [page](https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/Paguro/wiki/UncleJim-vs.-PCollections). \r\nSo now there are two ways forward -  \r\n1.

from consistency with the implementation of newer APIs this also provides more resilient retries (e.g. in case of TimeoutExceptions and other RetriableExceptions in general) and simplifies the code to some extent.\r\n\r\nOne notable detail is the addition of unsupported version handling in the failure callback in the `AdminApiDriver` and as a new callback in the `AdminApiHandler` and the `AdminApiLookupStrategy`. The relevant callback is invoked in case an `UnsupportedVersionException` is caught by the driver and ~returns a flag indicating whether the exception could be handled (like the similar callback in `Call`)~ it is used to process and fail just the keys for which the exception can't be handled.\r\n\r\n_Testing_\r\n\r\nThe change has been tested manually and with a new `KafkaAdminClientTest`, as well as with added unit tests for the new handler and the changed driver behavior. The retry aspect also unexpectedly stalled a Connect `AdminClientUnitTestEnv` test due to retrying after a timeout where the test expected an immediate failure.\r\nAlso a JMH benchmark for the deleted equivalent of the fulfillment stage of the API has been deleted and not replaced as I wasn't too sure whether I can recreate it after the `AdminApiDriver` refactoring.\r\n\r\n_Notable changes after review comments_\r\n\r\n- Made the unsupported version handling callback return a mapping of keys to be failed instead of a simple boolean flag;\r\n- Added an unsupported version handling callback for the lookup strategy as well;\r\n- Limited lookup retries to happen only after specifically `NotLeaderOrFollowerException` or `LeaderNotAvailableException` instead of after any `InvalidMetadataException`;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-21T20:34:19Z","updated_at":"2023-04-20T03:29:28Z","closed_at":"2023-04-20T03:29:27Z","merged_at":"2023-04-20T03:29:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"e14dd8024adae746c50c8b7d9cd268e859669576","assignee":{"login":"dengziming","id":26023240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIzMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26023240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming","html_url":"https://github.com/dengziming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dengziming","id":26023240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDIzMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26023240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming","html_url":"https://github.com/dengziming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dengziming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13432/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13432/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13432/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c4b698b8b0b2e4548ac2e33fb338512bb0994758","head":{"label":"dimitarndimitrov:kafka-14821","ref":"kafka-14821","sha":"c4b698b8b0b2e4548ac2e33fb338512bb0994758","user":{"login":"dimitarndimitrov","id":30328539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzI4NTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30328539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov","html_url":"https://github.com/dimitarndimitrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimitarndimitrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":616989779,"node_id":"R_kgDOJMaEUw","name":"kafka","full_name":"dimitarndimitrov/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dimitarndimitrov","id":30328539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzI4NTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30328539?v=

the OffsetSyncStore only stores the latest OffsetSync, and discards all others. This prevents the store from offering translations behind the replication flow, which was previously possible before KAFKA-12468 fixed the translation correctness problem.\r\n\r\nTo alleviate this, use a bounded in-memory index to store previous offset syncs, and offer those syncs for translation when previously translation was not possible. This cache will only store offset syncs seen since the last restart of the MirrorCheckpointTask in order to to alleviate KAFKA-13659.\r\n\r\nBecause the index must be bounded, we must remove/overwrite syncs eventually. This means that the translation can be non-monotonic for a specific upstream offset, and the MirrorCheckpointTask must have logic to ensure monotonicity of checkpoints with knowledge of the consumer group and its state. Checkpoints that would create unintended non-monotonicity are dropped by the CheckpointTask.\r\n\r\nThe existing integration tests pass without any modification, and an additional test targeting this historical translation behavior is added.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

So this method has been moved to ToolUtils to avoid circular dependency on the modules. Pls suggest any alternative if possible.\r\n- build.gradle has been updated to mention 2 more dependencies of tools module\r\n- checkstyle import-control is updated to mention allowed imports by tools

fixes a regression introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/12828, which caused workers to start unconditionally loading (and therefore validating) SSL-related properties when issuing REST requests to other workers. That was fine for the most part, but caused unnecessary failures when workers were configured with invalid SSL-related properties and their REST API used HTTP instead of HTTPS.\r\n\r\nIf this fix is acceptable, it should be backported to the 3.4 branch before the 3.4.1 release.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-17T18:33:59Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T16:38:21Z","closed_at":"2023-03-20T15:32:02Z","merged_at":"2023-03-20T15:32:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"e427897c67c83ada340f731dc952bfd49d6cc32e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13415/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13415/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13415/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/356fa8e563081da0de008e70f1006776e9b2cfe5","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-14816","ref":"kafka-14816","sha":"356fa8e563081da0de008e70f1006776e9b2cfe5","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

of generating random messages continuously when using `--record-size N` for the `ProducerPerformance` script, pre-generate approximately 10MB of candidate byte arrays of size `N`, then randomly select candidates from them as we do when we load the candidates from file.\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\nI noticed that sending fixed data from a file with messages of size N achieved roughly 2 times the throughput of using `--record-size` N. On profiling I found that the random byte generation was using a significant amount of wallclock time. By pre-generating some randomized data we avoid the cost of randomising all the data but still get data that is not unrealistically compressible (as fixed in PR #10469)\r\n\r\n##

to this PR, versioned stores always returned null for `get(key, timestamp)` calls where the timestamp has exceeded the store's history retention, even if the latest value for the key (i.e., the one returned from `get(key)`) satisfies the timestamp bound. This was an oversight from the earlier implementation -- `get(key, timestamp)` should still return a record in this situation since the record exists in the store. This PR updates both the javadocs and the implementation accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

on work by @cmccabe #13003\r\n\r\n## Pre-Migration mode in QuorumController\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the concept of pre-migration mode to the KRaft controller. While in this mode, the controller will only allow certain write operations. The purpose of this is to disallow metadata changes when the controller is waiting for the ZK migration records to be committed.\r\n\r\nThe following ControllerWriteEvent operations are permitted in pre-migration mode\r\n\r\n* completeActivation\r\n* maybeFenceReplicas\r\n* writeNoOpRecord\r\n* processBrokerHeartbeat\r\n* registerBroker\r\n* unregisterBroker\r\n\r\nRaft events and other controller events do not follow the same code path as ControllerWriteEvent, so they are not affected by this new behavior.\r\n\r\n## New metric from KIP-866\r\nThe `kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=ZkMigrationState` metric is now supported by the KRaft controller.\r\n\r\n \r\n## Upgrade after 3.4 ZK migration\r\nIn 3.4.0, we wrote a single `ZkMigrationStateRecord(PRE_MIGRATION)` at the beginning of the migration, but nothing after it completed. This means in later versions, we need to tolerate the stray record. This patch redefines the enum value 1 to mean `MIGRATION` rather than `PRE_MIGRATION`. This handles the upgrade from 3.4 scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n## System tests\r\nTwo new system tests are included in this patch:\r\n\r\n`zookeeper_migration_test.py::TestMigration.test_pre_migration_mode_3_4` Starts a KRaft cluster in 3.4 with migrations disabled. It then performs a rolling upgrade to 3.5 with migrations enabled. The test ensures that a migration does not happen and checks for a log message\r\n\r\n> ZkMigrationState is NONE which means this cluster should not be migrated from ZooKeeper\r\n\r\n`zookeeper_migration_test.py::TestMigration.test_upgrade_after_3_4_migration` Starts a ZK cluster and KRaft controller in 3.4 and does a migration. The KRaft controller is upgraded to 3.5 still with migrations enabled. The test ensures that the migration does not happen again and checks for the log message\r\n\r\n> Read a ZkMigrationState of PRE_MIGRATION from a ZK migration on Apache Kafka 3.4.\r\n\r\nThe release artifacts from 3.4.0 have been uploaded to Confluent's public S3 bucket in order to support these new tests.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* [x] Add system test for upgrading from older KRaft version to 3.4, ensure we write the correct ZkMigrationStateRecord\r\n* [x] Additional unit tests for completion event

KRaft thread names.\r\n\r\n- Always use kebab case. That is, \"my-thread-name\".\r\n\r\n- Thread prefixes are just strings, not Option[String] or Optional<String>.\r\n  If you don't want a prefix, use the empty string.\r\n\r\n- Thread prefixes end in a dash (except the empty prefix). Then you can\r\n  calculate thread names as $prefix + \"my-thread-name\"\r\n\r\n- Broker-only components get \"broker-$id-\" as a thread name prefix. For example, \"broker-1-\"\r\n\r\n- Controller-only components get \"controller-$id-\" as a thread name prefix. For example, \"controller-1-\"\r\n\r\n- Shared components get \"kafka-$id-\" as a thread name prefix. For example, \"kafka-0-\"\r\n\r\n- Always pass a prefix to KafkaEventQueue, so that threads have names like\r\n  \"broker-0-metadata-loader-event-handler\" rather than \"event-handler\". Prior to this PR, we had\r\n  several threads just named \"EventHandler\" which was not helpful for debugging.\r\n\r\n- QuorumController thread name is \"quorum-controller-123-event-handler\"\r\n\r\n- Don't set a thread prefix for replication threads started by ReplicaManager. They run only on the\r\n  broker, and already include the broker ID.\r\n\r\nStandardize KRaft slf4j log prefixes.\r\n\r\n- Names should be of the form \"[ComponentName id=$id] \". So for a ControllerServer with ID 123, we\r\n  will have \"[ControllerServer id=123] \"\r\n\r\n- For the QuorumController class, use the prefix \"[QuorumController id=$id] \" rather than\r\n  \"[Controller <nodeId] \", to make it clearer that this is a KRaft controller.\r\n\r\n- In BrokerLifecycleManager, add isZkBroker=true to the log prefix for the migration case.\r\n\r\nStandardize

this PR, I implemented the committed API. Here are the specifics:\r\n1. the CommitRequestManager handles committed() request. \r\n2. I implemented a UnsentOffsetFetchRequestState to handle deduping the request: because we don't want to send the exact requests repeatedly.\r\n3. I implemented the retry mechanism: Some retriable errors will be retried automatically\r\n4. ClientResponse errors are handled in the handlers.\r\n5. Some of the top-level APIs were refactored

invoking `KafkaProducer::abortTransaction` when no transaction is currently open (via `KafkaProducer::beginTransaction`) causes an `IllegalStateException`, requests by source tasks to abort the current transaction when they have not returned any records from `SourceTask::poll` will currently cause the task to fail.\r\n\r\nThis patch gracefully handles that scenario by skipping the call to `KafkaProducer::abortTransaction` but emitting a `WARN`-level log message.\r\n\r\nA basic unit test is added to ensure that we do not attempt to abort empty transactions.\r\n\r\nA small bug in the internal API we use in `ExactlyOnceWorkerSourceTaskTest` for manipulating and awaiting source task poll contents is also fixed (two lines to change, two hours to figure out 😄).\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up item, we may want to consider using the `MockProducer` class in these and other unit tests since it may involve less work than manually mocking the `Producer` interface and should more-closely resemble the behavior of the `KafkaProducer` class (for example, it will automatically check for transaction state during calls to `beginTransaction`, `abortTransaction`, and `commitTransaction`).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-10T21:16:41Z","updated_at":"2023-03-16T12:34:41Z","closed_at":"2023-03-14T19:10:29Z","merged_at":"2023-03-14T19:10:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"404a833df7de9a7d5efe35beb5bafb7c6972601e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13379/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13379/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13379/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/a1dba2e8cd1f17bcac3cb85482e8c3c91765639d","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-14799","ref":"kafka-14799","sha":"a1dba2e8cd1f17bcac3cb85482e8c3c91765639d","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

- Propagate Topic Ids to the Group Coordinator during Offsets Commit](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14793)\r\n\r\nThis PR is a pre-requisite for [PR-13240](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13240). It introduces topic ids in the signature of the group coordinator `commitOffsets` method, and performs a conversion between `TopicPartition`  and `TopicIdPartition` when interacting with the group metadata manager. Topic ids are not propagated to that component yet. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, topic ids are resolved from the topic names provided in the offset commit request. With [PR-13240](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13240), ids will be provided by the request from version 9.\r\n\r\nEventually, topic ids will be part of the data model authored by the group coordinator, but the corresponding change is out of scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-10T14:54:40Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T12:53:33Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T11:20:27Z","merged_at":"2023-03-15T11:20:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"d01662fb0f7bbb43e6a2d22f5ea88b5bf136057c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13378/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13378/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13378/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e541615bb8270697135a3986484359f10ebd8d68","head":{"label":"Hangleton:KAFKA-14793-topic-ids-group-coordinator-adaptor","ref":"KAFKA-14793-topic-ids-group-coordinator-adaptor","sha":"e541615bb8270697135a3986484359f10ebd8d68","user":{"login":"Hangleton","id":638312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODMxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/638312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton","html_url":"https://github.com/Hangleton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":200349408,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDAzNDk0MDg=","name":"kafka","full_name":"Hangleton/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Hangleton","id":638312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODMxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/638312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton","html_url":"https://github.com/Hangleton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hangleton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Hangleton/kafka","description":"Mirror

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14569\r\n- The existing `EmbeddedConnectCluster` (used in Connect integration tests) uses a backing `EmbeddedKafkaCluster` which internally also spins up an `EmbeddedZookeeper`.\r\n- This patch migrates the `EmbeddedKafkaCluster` to run in KRaft mode, leveraging the existing [KafkaClusterTestKit](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/5f6a050bfee09b634497f9ba35e2964289be1e4d/core/src/test/java/kafka/testkit/KafkaClusterTestKit.java#L80) from `core`.\r\n- Connect / MirrorMaker integration tests which setup a Kafka cluster with `SASL_PLAINTEXT` or  `SSL` listeners needed to be updated to take into account the controller listeners as well and also update the authorizer used (from `kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer` to `org.apache.kafka.metadata.authorizer.StandardAuthorizer`, see [KIP-801](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-801%3A+Implement+an+Authorizer+that+stores+metadata+in+__cluster_metadata)) since the old authorizer relied on ZooKeeper.\r\n- The existing `EmbeddedKafkaCluster` had some logic to restart brokers and have them listening on the same ports as earlier (in order to verify Connect's functionality when its backing Kafka cluster goes down and then comes back up). This was refactored to move the responsibility of using a fixed port in the broker's listeners config to the tests themselves.\r\n- Some changes to `KafkaClusterTestKit` in order to allow externally configuring listeners configurations and other minor improvements.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-10T06:30:27Z","updated_at":"2024-07-16T06:38:40Z","closed_at":"2024-07-16T06:38:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"25097055443c11d314c0b0b16f18245df31ba847","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

That method requires more offset syncs to be emitted by the MirrorSourceTask, in order to keep the same bound on the max.offset.lag. #13178 failed to change the logic for triggering offset syncs, and

to this PR, AbstractSegments automatically called the helper method to clean up expired segments as part of `getOrCreateSegmentIfLive()`. This works fine for windowed store implementations which call `getOrCreateSegmentIfLive()` exactly once per `put()` call, but is inefficient and difficult to reason about for the new RocksDBVersionedStore implementation (cf. https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13188) which makes potentially multiple calls to `getOrCreateSegmentIfLive()` for different segments for a single `put()` call. This PR addresses this by refactoring the call to clean up expired segments out of `getOrCreateSegmentIfLive()`, opting to have the different segments implementations specify when cleanup should occur instead. After this PR, RocksDBVersionedStore only cleans up expired segments once per call to `put()`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

RocksDB-based implementation of versioned stores introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13188 consists of a \"latest value store\" and separate (logical) \"segments stores.\" A single put operation may need to modify multiple (two) segments, or both a segment and the latest value store, which opens the possibility to store inconsistencies if the first write succeeds while the later one fails. When this happens, Streams will error out, but the store still needs to be able to recover upon restart. This PR adds the necessary repair logic into RocksDBVersionedStore to effectively undo the earlier failed write when a store inconsistency is encountered.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

first implementing ServiceLoaded plugins, there was a problem: When using ServiceLoader on an isolated plugin classloader would also discover the plugins on the classpath. This is because the ClassLoader::getResources call would find all of the classpath resources, including the plugins which were present on the classpath. At the time, this was prevented by intercepting the getResources call for the specific manifest files which the connect framework didn't want to mis-attribute.\r\n\r\nThis method of preventing mis-attribution is inconsistent across the different plugins, and prevents plugins from using the ServiceLoader to discover other plugins on the classpath. Instead of intercepting the getResources call which affects all ServiceLoader.load calls, the framework should filter the results of the ServiceLoader just during plugin discovery. This will prevent mis-attribution while still allowing other ServiceLoader.load calls to behave consistently.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this bug is also present on the reflection path, but presents itself when a classpath plugin is extended by an isolated plugin. In that situation, the Reflections library returns the classpath plugin class along with the isolated plugin class. This causes the same mis-attribution of the classpath plugin to an isolated plugin, and can be solved in the same way.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-07T00:53:19Z","updated_at":"2023-05-26T16:17:07Z","closed_at":"2023-05-26T16:17:07Z","merged_at":"2023-05-26T16:17:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ec6b5e1e2e29fd6a45d2e9344c0bdf3470454f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d2a974a0fb2326035b18ae86c017e437febd3cfb","head":{"label":"gharris1727:minor-exclude-serviceload-plugins","ref":"minor-exclude-serviceload-plugins","sha":"d2a974a0fb2326035b18ae86c017e437febd3cfb","user":{"login":"gharris1727","id":5856969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTY5Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5856969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727","html_url":"https://github.com/gharris1727","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192386443,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTIzODY0NDM=","name":"kafka","full_name":"gharris1727/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gharris1727","id":5856969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTY5Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5856969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727","html_url":"https://github.com/gharris1727","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gharris1727/kafka","description":"Mirror

of logging an `ERROR`-level message when topic syncing is enabled (which it is by default) and no ACL authorizer is configured on the source Kafka cluster, we first issue an `INFO`-level message that suggests to the user that they disable topic ACL syncing, and then for each subsequent time, issue a `DEBUG`-level message.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts while implementing this:\r\n\r\n1. The number of testing-only constructors for `MirrorSourceConnector` is getting a bit out of hand. We might consider replacing all of them with a package-private `start(MirrorSourceConfig)` method, which can help unify testing and non-testing code paths, as well as reduce the testing-only code that we have to tack on to non-testing code.\r\n2. We could possibly expand on the test case introduced here to simulate an ACL authorizer being added to the source Kafka cluster during the lifetime of the connector. I've omitted this as I don't believe it's a very common case and the changes here do not seem likely to introduce any risk for it.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

PR refactors AbstractStickyAssignor without changing any logic to make it easier to add rack-awareness. The class currently consists of a lot of collections that are passed around various methods, with some methods updating some collections. Addition of rack-awareness made this class with very large methods even more complex and harder to read.

avoid mistakes during dynamic broker config updates that could potentially affect clients, we restrict changes that can be performed dynamically without broker restart. For broker keystore updates, we require the DN to be the same for the old and new certificates since this could potentially contain host names used for host name verification by clients. DNs are compared using standard Java implementation of X500Principal.equals() which compares canonical names. If tags of fields change from one with a printable string representation and one without or vice-versa, canonical name check fails even if the actual name is the same since canonical representation converts to hex for some tags only. We can relax the verification to allow dynamic updates in this case by enabling dynamic update if either the canonical name or the RFC2253 string representation of the DN matches.\r\n\r\n### Committer

Replace BrokerMetadataListener with MetadataLoader\r\n\r\nReplace BrokerMetadataListener with MetadataLoader. BrokerMetadataListener was, in a sense, an\r\nearly prototype of MetadataLoader.It constructed a MetadataImage object from records supplied by\r\nthe raft layer.\r\n\r\nMetadataLoader is a rewrite of this code with several improvements.\r\n\r\n- MetadataLoadder is in Java, and not part of the core gradle module.\r\n\r\n- MetadataLoadder is not broker-specific. This is especially useful in combined mode where it means\r\n  we do not have to have a separate, controller-specific code path for creating MetadataImage\r\n  objects.\r\n\r\n- MetadataLoader supports multiple publishers rather than a single publisher.\r\n\r\n- Publisher can be dynamically added and removed from MetadataLoader.","created_at":"2023-03-05T20:46:23Z","updated_at":"2023-03-16T19:12:57Z","closed_at":"2023-03-14T17:24:39Z","merged_at":"2023-03-14T17:24:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d597b0fc81a1e77905d57666069b336eba8805c","assignee":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13344/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13344/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13344/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c089e8901ee22b933cf30ed3cda28cb440429b8f","head":{"label":"cmccabe:cmccabe_2023-03-03_remove_broker_metadata_listener","ref":"cmccabe_2023-03-03_remove_broker_metadata_listener","sha":"c089e8901ee22b933cf30ed3cda28cb440429b8f","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cm
