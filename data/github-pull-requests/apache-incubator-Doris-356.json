Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1.\r\nWhen we decommission some BEs with SSD disks,\r\nif there are no SSD disks on the remaining BEs, it will be impossible to select a suitable destination path.\r\nIn this case, we need to ignore the storage medium property and try to select the destination path again.\r\nSet `isSupplement` to true will ignore the storage medium property.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nWhen the BE nodes where all replicas of a tablet are located are decommission,\r\nand this task is a VERSION_INCOMPLETE task.\r\nThis will lead to failure to select a suitable dest replica.\r\nAt this time, we should try to convert this task to a REPLICA_MISSING task, and schedule it again.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I

Proposed changes\r\nFor #4674 \r\nThis is a udaf for approximate topn using Space-Saving algorithm.  At present, we can only calculate the frequent items and their frequencies in a certain column, based on which we can implement similar topN functions supported by Kylin in the future. \r\n\r\nI have also added a test to calculate the accuracy of this algorithm. The following is a rough running result. The total amount of data is 1 million lines and follows the Zipfian distribution, where Element Cardinality represents the data cardinality, 20X, 50X.. The value representing space_expand_rate is 20,50, which is used to set the counter number in the space-saving algorithm\r\n```\r\nzf exponent = 0.5\r\nElement cardinality\t        20X        50X          100X\r\n               1000\t\t100%\t   100%         100%\r\n               10000\t\t100%\t   100%\t\t100%\r\n\t       100000\t\t100%\t   100%\t\t100%\r\n\t       500000\t\t 94%\t    98%\t\t 99%\r\n\r\nzf exponent = 0.6，1\r\nElement cardinality\t        20X        50X          100X\r\n\t\t1000\t\t100%\t   100%         100%\r\n\t\t10000\t\t100%\t   100%\t\t100%\r\n\t\t100000\t\t100%\t   100%\t\t100%\r\n\t\t500000\t\t100%\t   100%\t\t100%\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #ISSUE), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] If this change need a document change, I have updated the document\r\n- [] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n(1) The implementation logic of `tablets web page` is that:\r\n&emsp;&emsp;Firstly, get all the tablets of the BE;\r\n&emsp;&emsp;Secondly, return specific number tablets in front to web page according to the value of request parameter `limit`. \r\nThis patch optimize the implementation logic of `tablets web page` that getting specific number tablets in BE according to the value of request parameter `limit` and then return them to web page.\r\n\r\n(2) It will return default `1000` tablets through http interface `http://be_host:webserver_port/tablets_page`. If the number of tablet in the BE is less than 1000, there will be `coredump` in the following code:\r\n\r\nbe/src/http/action/tablets_info_action.cpp\r\n![2020-10-21 16-27-08 的屏幕截图](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68884553/96693947-6ab4a300-13ba-11eb-848e-35407dd1531f.png)\r\n![2020-10-21 16-27-27 的屏幕截图](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68884553/96693955-6daf9380-13ba-11eb-8db9-7ac924252172.png)\r\nThis patch fixed the bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

the materialized slot is empty in inline view, the scanner will throw exception 'no materialized slot!'.\r\nWhen the outer query does not need any real columns of the inner query at all, such as the outer query only contains constant calculations,\r\nall slots in the inner query will not be materialized.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nselect c1 from (select 'xx' c1, k1 from test) t1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this does not mean that the inner query (select 'xx' c1, k1 from test) does not need to be executed.\r\nBecause the number of rows in the outer result needs to be determined by the number of rows in the inner query.\r\nIn this case, the inner query scan node needs to add a column to ensure the correct result.\r\nAt the same time it can avoid the scan node reporting errors.\r\n\r\nFixed

SelectList will not be re-anlyze after rewrite step, which will result in the incorrect number of self-incrementing SlotDescriptor ID in resultExprs .\r\n\r\nSo we need to reset the analysis state of

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are M threads to do base compaction and N threads to do cumulative compaction for each disk.  Too many compaction tasks may run out of memory, so the max concurrency of running compaction tasks is limited by semaphore. If the running threads cost too much memory, we can't defense it. In addition, reducing concurrency to avoid OOM will lead to some compaction tasks can't be executed in time and we may encounter more heavy compaction.  Therefore, concurrency limitation is not enough.\r\n\r\nThe strategy proposed in #3624  may be effective to solve the OOM. \r\n\r\nA CompactionPermitLimiter is used for compaction limitation, and use single-producer/multi-consumer model. Producer will try to generate compaction tasks and acquire `permits` for each task.  The compaction task which can hold `permits` will be executed in thread pool and each finished task will release its `permits`.\r\n\r\n`permits` should be applied for before a compaction task can execute. When the sum of `permits` held by executing compaction tasks reaches a threshold, subsequent compaction task will be no longer allowed, until some `permits` are released. Tablet compaction score is used as `permits` of compaction task here.\r\n\r\nTo some extent, memory consumption can be limited by setting appropriate `permits` threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.
