complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-20T12:18:07Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T09:34:32Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5cb51163d40279f18bee69990007e8b63f7258f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":616950024,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MTY5NTAwMjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Windows","name":"Windows","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":null},{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1801235148,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODAxMjM1MTQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/TVM%20OP","name":"TVM

inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-17T06:18:13Z","updated_at":"2020-01-19T20:07:39Z","closed_at":"2020-01-19T20:07:37Z","merged_at":"2020-01-19T20:07:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"d95d74fd732c12a03ebc0d219eb5823abd824291","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/871d6403a341c922d312d480e0205b871c3058a5","head":{"label":"TaoLv:cmake-openmp","ref":"cmake-openmp","sha":"871d6403a341c922d312d480e0205b871c3058a5","user":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113452572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0NTI1NzI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nExport MXAPIHandle symbol and fixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17292\r\n\r\nHere are the causes of the problem:\r\n\r\n1.  Horovod uses MX_API_BEGIN() and MX_API_END() from mxnet/c_api_error.h to catch and throw errors in horovod APIs: https://github.com/horovod/horovod/blob/master/horovod/mxnet/mpi_ops.cc#L224\r\nMX_API_BEGIN() is a macro that calls MXAPIHandleException https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/include/mxnet/c_api_error.h#L36. Before #17128, MXAPIHandleException is an inline function. And therefore when #17128 introduced a new function call NormalizeError() inside MXAPIHandleException it broke Horovod integration because the symbol of NormalizeError is not whitelist by MXNet distribution.\r\n2. #17298 removed NormalizeError() from MXAPIHandleException and made it not inline. https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17208/files#diff-875aa4c013dbd73b044531e439e8afddR67. This time the error becomes undefined symbol of MXAPIHandleException.\r\n\r\nSo to summarize, the problem is not that Horovod requires MXAPIHandleException function to be inline. The rootcause is that MXNet did not whitelist the symbol *MXAPIHandleException* but only whitelisted the symbols that are being used inside MXAPIHandleException function. It was okay when the function MXAPIHandleException is inline, but became a problem when it's not. A good practice is to whitelist symbol *MXAPIHandleException* instead of its internal functions.\r\n## Comments ##\r\n@szha Please help to

Description ##\r\nfix NOTICE issues in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17329\r\nLooks like we have to specify the current year and update it every year.\r\n\r\ncc @szha @samskalicky \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

recently fixing #17321 , I stumbled upon cases where `test_arctanh`, `test_arcsin` failing due to getting value which were out of the functions domain.\r\n\r\nThe way we generated the test array from normal distribution meant that even if very low probability, the chance of an out of domain value showing up was still there.\r\n\r\nTo this end, have defined a simple wrapper around `np.random.uniform` (similar to `random_arrays`), which lets us specify the lower and upper bound of the generated array.\r\n\r\nA pro of using uniform distribution is that we generate samples equal from the whole range of the distribution unlike normal which is centred around mean thus allowing in better

Description ##\r\nAs of jemalloc 5, jemalloc default build can not be used in libraries that are dlopened. However, libmxnet.so is dlopened by Python (ctypes). To use MXNet with jemalloc 5, users must not to system libjemalloc.so but must rather link to a libjemalloc compiled with special parameters to allow dlopen to work.\r\n\r\njemalloc 5 is distributed as part of Ubuntu 18.10 and higher, as well as Debian Stable. Users on these systems will be unable to compile MXNet with USE_JEMALLOC=ON.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to build jemalloc as part of our build. See https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17121 for an implementation. Given the lack of review of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17121 and the reliance of a patched jemalloc version to allow integration into our build, let's first proceed with the current PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Change USE_JEMALLOC default to

Description ##\r\n* Add Kron operator\r\n* Including Forward and Backward\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\nPerformance comparisons (in microseconds):\r\nOperator | Official NumPy | Legacy ctypes | New ctypes | New Cython\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nkron | 14.42 | 21.46 | 16.73 |

@reminisce \r\n\r\nGoing through the code for `_backward_tanh`, it is implemented as `1 - (tanh^2(x))`, which is equivalent to `sech^2(x)` or `(1/cosh(x))^2`. \r\n\r\nHowever for the failed seed, I have verified that `1 - (tanh^2(x))` is not coming equivalent to `(1/ cosh(x))^2` for the randomly generated array of dim 4 (will try to investigate further for the cause).\r\n\r\nFor now replacing

Description ##\r\nThe version comparison algorithm for minimum cuda version decorator was wrong. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-15T09:37:20Z","updated_at":"2020-01-19T04:17:25Z","closed_at":"2020-01-19T04:17:25Z","merged_at":"2020-01-19T04:17:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"49df604ac3bb156e446671403c86a3535af9615d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/0047ff7394feae8647e0105fefe34799c45d0ed1","head":{"label":"perdasilva:less_than_fix","ref":"less_than_fix","sha":"0047ff7394feae8647e0105fefe34799c45d0ed1","user":{"login":"perdasilva","id":785683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva","html_url":"https://github.com/perdasilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143983733,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDM5ODM3MzM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"perdasilva/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"perdasilva","id":785683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/785683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva","html_url":"https://github.com/perdasilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/perdasilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/perdasilva/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nAdd op random.laplace, which could generate random samples with Laplace Distribution.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-15T07:53:58Z","updated_at":"2020-03-16T04:52:55Z","closed_at":"2020-03-16T04:52:54Z","merged_at":"2020-03-16T04:52:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"ea2dabaae5e1453572c9105f77322977bd14c108","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17316/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17316/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17316/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5dc7075ef0fb3dc699d711fd2515597042f98d47","head":{"label":"AntiZpvoh:NumPyLaplaceOp","ref":"NumPyLaplaceOp","sha":"5dc7075ef0fb3dc699d711fd2515597042f98d47","user":{"login":"AntiZpvoh","id":59728467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzI4NDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59728467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiZpvoh","html_url":"https://github.com/AntiZpvoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiZpvoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiZpvoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiZpvoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiZpvoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiZpvoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiZpvoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiZpvoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiZpvoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntiZpvoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233015417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzMwMTU0MTc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"AntiZpvoh/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AntiZpvoh","id":59728467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzI4NDY3","avatar_url":"https://avat

Description ##\r\nThis PR improves the reliability of the test_reduce unittest in test_ndarray.py.  Two seen test failure outputs are shown below and can be repro'd with:\r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_SEED=359297469 nosetests --verbose -s --logging-level=DEBUG tests/python/unittest/test_ndarray.py:test_reduce\r\nMXNET_TEST_SEED=626874295 nosetests --verbose -s tests/python/unittest/test_ndarray.py:test_reduce\r\n```\r\n In the first case, the tolerance for the float32 precision tests appears to be too tight, and has been relaxed.  In the other case, a cast of the input data for the numpy 'golden copy' only was removed so that the data is identical for both models in the comparison, as is critical for getting argmax and argmin to compare identically.  This only became a problem when float64 testing was recently introduced to this test.\r\n\r\nWith the fixes, 3000 trials of this test generated no errors.\r\n\r\nThe most recent PR to touch this test is https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/16234.\r\n\r\n@ptrendx @wkcn\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_SEED=359297469 nosetests --verbose -s tests/python/unittest/test_ndarray.py:test_reduce\r\n\r\ntest_ndarray.test_reduce ...

##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-14T21:17:21Z","updated_at":"2020-01-22T22:55:56Z","closed_at":"2020-01-18T05:55:44Z","merged_at":"2020-01-18T05:55:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e64e96478fb63f0f5e24ad0a8757df50840d5f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":738857750,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3Mzg4NTc3NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/API%20change","name":"API

Description ##\r\nAlign the repr() function of RNN cell with RNN layer in Gluon RNN API.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/58cbd65cfe98e50da36303c5f2adc65358d3a0b8/python/mxnet/gluon/rnn/rnn_layer.py#L121\r\n\r\nIn RNN API, we often initialize the i2h weights with shape (`num_gates * hidden_dim`, `input_dim`). So `shape[0]` will get the size as hidden dimension times the number of gates. The repr() function should intend to print the information such as mapping the input dimension to the hidden/output dimension in the line above. In the RNN layers' API, it gets the right dimension, while it is not true in the cells' API.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your

Description ##\r\nAdd new feature to be consistent with numpy default type. \r\nFor example, in original, default type only support 32 bit storage dtype such as float32 (or int32 in some special op). However, with this new feature, user can set 64 bit storage type as default dtype, such as float64 (int64 for some special op).\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet\r\nfrom mxnet import numpy as np\r\nfrom mxnet import npx\r\na=np.array([1, 2, 3])  # a.dtype = 'float32'\r\nprev_state=npx.set_np_default_dtype()  # prev_state = False\r\nb=np.array([1, 2, 3])  # b.dtype = 'float64'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to

changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nAdd linalg.pinv op\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16868\r\nTo perform constraint check on a tensor, one only need to multiply `npx.constraint_check(condition(tensor), msg)` with the origin tensor. In such way, the `constraint_check` is forced to be evaluated.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nAdd GPU support for custom operators. \r\nThis is a continuation of custom operators project, initial CPU support is implemented here: #15921\r\n\r\n## Design ##\r\nWorking backward from the user. Here is an example of custom operator forward function for GPU. \r\n\r\nNotice the function interface is the same as CPU operator. The input and output tensors are already in GPU, so you don't need to memcpy them to GPU. \r\n\r\nYou need the CUDA stream from OpResource in order to launch your CUDA kernel on the correct GPU, and mx_stream_t is defined as cudaStream_t when you compile the code with NVCC.\r\n```\r\nMXReturnValue forwardGPU(std::map<std::string, std::string> attrs,\r\n                         std::vector<MXTensor> inputs,\r\n                         std::vector<MXTensor> outputs,\r\n                         OpResource res) {\r\n    ... \r\n    mx_stream_t cuda_stream = res.get_cuda_stream();\r\n    gpu_forward<<<grid, block, 0, cuda_stream>>>(out_data, in_data, N);\r\n    return MX_SUCCESS;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen user will register a single operator with both CPU and GPU computation logic, by specifying the device type in register function. This registration works for any context as user only passes in a string.\r\n```\r\nREGISTER_OP(my_op)\r\n.setForward(forwardCPU, \"cpu\")\r\n.setForward(forwardGPU, \"gpu\")\r\n.setBackward(backwardCPU, \"cpu\")\r\n.setBackward(backwardGPU, \"gpu\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen user compiles the library similar to compiling the CPU operator library. Python usage is exactly the same as CPU custom operators\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nmx.library.load(os.path.abspath('libmy_op_lib.so'))\r\na = mx.nd.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], ctx=mx.gpu())\r\nb = mx.nd.array([[7],[8],[9]], ctx=mx.gpu())\r\nmx.nd.my_op(a,b)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## This PR is not ##\r\n- Supporting CPU function is one library and GPU function in another library. Both CPU and GPU functions have to be in the same library.\r\n- Making inferShape and inferType context aware\r\n- Supporting dynamic loading of custom context\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add Fcompute<gpu> registration, and pass NDArray context to custom library in c_api.cc\r\n- Add context

Description ##\r\nBfloat16 is wildly used in Deep Learning especially on training to get a better performance.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add bf16 support based on mxnet AMP(Automatic Mixed Precision) module .\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [done ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [done ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ done] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\nThis PR has passed unitest and preci test in local machine.\r\nUnit tests are added for this PR.\r\n\r\n@ZhennanQin @ElaineBao @xinyu-intel @TaoLv @PatricZhao

Description ##\r\nchange unary infer type\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nremove the stright dope from nightly test since it's deprecated\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\n1. Remove the straight-dope from nightly-test since it's deprecated\r\n2. Run the nightly test against S3 pip wheel, it will fail if the nightly build fail\r\n3. Remove some unnecessary installation script\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with

Description ##\r\nHandling the case when `fill_value` is an ndarray.\r\nAdditional unit test for `np.full` has been added too.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Implement ndarray case for `fill_value` argument\r\n- [x] New unit test\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nWith minor improvement for

Description ##\r\nAdd a brief tutorial doc on CustomOp tutorial and examples\r\n\r\n## This PR is not ##\r\n- Updating docs on the MXNet website on extending MXNet\r\n- Consolidating operator related docs on the website\r\n\r\nThose will be addressed in the coming PRs\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-07T19:59:36Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T19:57:02Z","closed_at":"2020-01-29T19:57:02Z","merged_at":"2020-01-29T19:57:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"821b6e5c2cc86f6c043ef3a0e2a6953eaacf3055","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

## Description ##\r\nNumpy operator Quantile and Percentile.   @#16896\r\n \r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-07T06:23:10Z","updated_at":"2020-01-23T08:52:09Z","closed_at":"2020-01-23T08:52:09Z","merged_at":"2020-01-23T08:52:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"765ba32ea74550f90c4a72eb030f3c0625629058","assignee":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/874b6c6eb704fa492ba5aa8432611975dfc0d7a8","head":{"label":"Tommliu:quantile_percentile","ref":"quantile_percentile","sha":"874b6c6eb704fa492ba5aa8432611975dfc0d7a8","user":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40382964?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu","html_url":"https://github.com/Tommliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tommliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":219631509,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTk2MzE1MDk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Tommliu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Tommliu","id":40382964,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzgyOTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubuserconten

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nFix and clean up Ubuntu build from source instructions.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17226\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Simplify and fix Ubuntu build from source instructions\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nJustification for respective removals\r\n- Binary Python install instructions: 1) The instructions were outdated and incomplete 2) This is a \"Build From Source Guide\". Why include binary package install instructions? 3) There are better instructions for the binary python install at the Get Started Page. Thus link to that page instead.\r\n- `ci/docker/install/ubuntu_{core,python}.sh` \"quick\" install: 1) https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17226 2) Only supports Ubuntu 16.04\r\n- `./install_mxnet_ubuntu_python.sh`: Does not exist anymore\r\n- `dev_menu.py build`: The `dev_menu.py build` does things differently compared to the simple build instructions in this tutorial. For example, it uses virtualenv and contains other unrelated features such as building docker containers. I think it adds confusion for new users if we include it in the setup guide.

Description ##\r\nCurrent v1.6.x branch contains some bugs in MKL-DNN Rnn operators that will cause gradients explosion in the Backward pass. https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17183 has solved this problem. Besides, we also offered an enhancement for the Forward pass (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17075), which is prior to https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/17183. So we are expecting these two commits to be backported to v1.6.x branch.\r\n\r\n@leezu @ptrendx @TaoLv Please take a

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to correct the latency calculation in `example/quantization/launch_inference_mkldnn.sh`. the latency should be related to a batch not an image. Also change print from `bc` to `awk` as `bc` might not come always as installed package.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n@pengzhao-intel @xinyu-intel @TaoLv
