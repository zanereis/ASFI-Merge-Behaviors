PR for [GEODE-8652](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-8652) works around the situation where a thread wants to close a `Connection` while other threads are reading or writing on it.\r\n\r\n- NioSslEngine.close() proceeds even if readers (or writers) are\r\n  operating on its ByteBuffers, allowing Connection.close() to close its\r\n  socket and proceed.\r\n\r\n- NioSslEngine.close() needed a lock only on the output buffer, so \r\n  we split what was a single lock into two. Also instead of using \r\n  synchronized we use a ReentrantLock so we can \r\n  call tryLock() and time out if needed in NioSslEngine.close()\r\n\r\n- Since readers/writers may hold locks on these input/output buffers\r\n   when NioSslEngine.close() is called we needed to reference count\r\n   the buffers and return them to the pool only when the last user \r\n   was finished.\r\n\r\n- To manage the locking and reference counting a new AutoCloseable\r\n   ByteBufferSharing interface is introduced with a trivial implementation:\r\n   ByteBufferSharingNoOp and a real implementation:\r\n   ByteBufferSharingImpl.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Bill Burcham <bill.burcham@gmail.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Darrel Schneider <dschneider@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Ernie Burghardt <burghardte@vmware.com>\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

third attempt at fixing GEODE-8584 locking granularity.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we have fine-grained locking (read has its own lock, write has its own lock, and `NioSslEngine.close()` has a completely separate lock). Also in the place where we acquire the write lock in `close()` we have a finite wait time (1 minute.) so we don't prevent `Connection` from closing the socket.\r\n\r\nThis is a refinement of the [Finer-Grained Locking PR](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5632). That PR split the single lock into two (but does not have the timeout on write lock acquisition that this PR has.)  With that other PR, client code in e.g. .`MsgReader` had to do all this ceremony:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsynchronized (ioFilter.getInputSyncObject()) {\r\n  ioFilter.setInputInUse(true);\r\n  try {\r\n    ByteBuffer unwrappedBuffer = readAtLeast(Connection.MSG_HEADER_BYTES);\r\n\r\n    // do stuff with unwrappedBuffer\r\n\r\n  } finally {\r\n\tioFilter.setInputInUse(false);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@dschneider-pivotal noticed that this followed the `AutoCloseable` pattern. So this PR makes good on that observation and introduces the auto-closeable `ByteBufferSharing`. We now return a `ByteBufferSharing` from methods that used to return the input `ByteBuffer`. Callers acquire it in a try-with-resources and rely on the `AutoCloseable` protocol to take care of lock closing and reference counting (decrement).\r\n\r\nWith this PR that same `MsgReader` code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry (final ByteBufferSharing sharedBuffer = readAtLeast(Connection.MSG_HEADER_BYTES)) {\r\n  ByteBuffer unwrappedBuffer = sharedBuffer.getBuffer();\r\n\r\n  // do stuff with unwrappedBuffer\r\n  \r\n}\r\n```      \r\n\r\nThe value of this approach goes beyond mere concision. It helped me find places where we were failing to properly follow the locking and ref-counting protocol in the previous PR. Now the methods that require the special treatment are much more self-documenting. There is no danger of failing to lock now. The only risk is a failure to acquire the resource in a try-with-resources, resulting in a failure to release the lock and release the reference.\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] in `NioSslEngine` use `Lock` for `myNetData` (output) sync (shall we reuse `ByteBufferSharing`+`ByteBufferReferencing` for this?)\r\n- [ ] change `close()` sync to time out if `Lock` can't be acquired so that `close()` is no longer blocked on readers\r\n\r\n# Boilerplate TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

initial fix for [GEODE-8584](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-8584) has a hang when `Connection.notifyHandshakeWaiter()` tries to acquire the monitor on the `ByteBuffer` but that monitor is already held by another thread that is trying to read an ack.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to simply not try to acquire the monitor if we are closing the connection.\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket
