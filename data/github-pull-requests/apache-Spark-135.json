What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `DivideYMInterval#doGenCode` and `DivideDTInterval#doGenCode`, rely on the operand variable names provided by `nullSafeCodeGen` rather than calling `genCode` on the operands twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`DivideYMInterval#doGenCode` and `DivideDTInterval#doGenCode` call `genCode` on the operands twice (once directly, and once indirectly via `nullSafeCodeGen`). However, if you call `genCode` on an operand twice, you might not get back the same variable name for both calls (e.g., when the operand is not a `BoundReference` or if whole-stage codegen is turned off). When that happens, `nullSafeCodeGen` generates initialization code for one set of variables, but the divide expression generates usage code for another set of variables, resulting in compilation errors like this:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> create or replace temp view v1 as\r\n         > select * FROM VALUES\r\n         > (interval '10' months, interval '10' day, 2)\r\n         > as v1(period,

tests fail without the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen creating classes that extend multiple `Expression` traits, they have an inheritance conflict due to `nodePatterns` being different values. `nodePatterns` is also final, which makes the inheritance conflict unavoidable.\r\n\r\nThis error comes in after trying to override the field - `value nodePatterns in trait TimeZoneAwareExpression of type Seq[org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.trees.TreePattern.TreePattern] cannot override final member.\r\n`\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor now kept the traits changed to a minimum - removed `nodePatterns` final classifier from `TimeZoneAwareExpression`, `HigherOrderFunctions`, and `Generator`. I have propagated this change to more children classes of Expression, but this change can be expanded (or unexpanded) to other traits if needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEnables multiple trait inheritance for certain `Expression` types. Hand-picked a few of them to have their `nodePatterns` attribute not final.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a test that creates a dummy class that inherits all three of `TimeZoneAwareExpression`, `HigherOrderFunctions`, and `Generator` - the test is only to see if this can compile now. Since it compiles and runs, this issue is resolved for those three traits at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently CTE queries from Spark are not supported with MSSQL server via JDBC. This is because MSSQL server doesn't support the nested CTE syntax (`SELECT * FROM (WITH t AS (...) SELECT ... FROM t) WHERE 1=0`) that Spark builds from the original query (`options.tableOrQuery`) in `JDBCRDD.resolveTable()`  and in `JDBCRDD.compute()`.\r\nUnfortunately, it is non-trivial to split an arbitrary query into \"with\" and \"regular\" clauses in `MsSqlServerDialect`. So instead, I'm proposing a new general JDBC option `prepareQuery` that users can use if they have complex queries:\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"jdbc\")\r\n  .option(\"url\", jdbcUrl)\r\n  .option(\"prepareQuery\", \"WITH t AS (SELECT x, y FROM tbl)\")\r\n  .option(\"query\", \"SELECT * FROM t WHERE x > 10\")\r\n  .load()\r\n```\r\nThis change also works with MSSQL's temp table syntax:\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"jdbc\")\r\n  .option(\"url\", jdbcUrl)\r\n  .option(\"prepareQuery\", \"(SELECT * INTO #TempTable FROM (SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE x > 10) t)\")\r\n  .option(\"query\", \"SELECT * FROM #TempTable\")\r\n  .load()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support CTE and temp table queries with MSSQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, CTE and temp table queries are supported form now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new integration

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33436, that adds a legacy configuration. It's found that it can break a valid usacase (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33436/files#r863271189):\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nval ds = Seq(\"a,\", \"a,b\").toDS\r\nspark.read.schema(\r\n  StructType(\r\n    StructField(\"f1\", StringType, nullable = false) ::\r\n    StructField(\"f2\", StringType, nullable = false) :: Nil)\r\n  ).option(\"mode\", \"DROPMALFORMED\").csv(ds).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n| f1| f2|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  a|  b|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+----+\r\n| f1|  f2|\r\n+---+----+\r\n|  a|null|\r\n|  a|   b|\r\n+---+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a configuration to restore **Before** behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid breakage of valid usecases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds a new configuration `spark.sql.legacy.respectNullabilityInTextDatasetConversion` (`false` by default) to respect the nullability in `DataFrameReader.schema(schema).csv(dataset)` and `DataFrameReader.schema(schema).json(dataset)` when the user-specified schema is provided.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were added.","created_at":"2022-05-03T00:47:06Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:50:25Z","closed_at":"2022-05-05T07:23:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e5854e4c577847b89846a630d8ba2473d723696","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36435/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36435/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36435/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c8b35d1ed0be42794e9d38cfb0edb2c505b36afb","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-35912","ref":"SPARK-35912","sha":"c8b35d1ed0be42794e9d38cfb0edb2c505b36afb","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

impacts and executors register themselves with the driver under normal operations anyways.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nTwo new config flags.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How

DataFrame\r\nnew_schema = ...\r\n\r\ndf.rdd.toDF(schema=new_schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this triggers computation as described in

(nested etc)\r\n * new schema includes updates to description, nullability and additional metadata\r\n\r\nSee POC of workaround/util in https://github.com/ravwojdyla/spark-schema-utils\r\n\r\nAlso

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for `UserDefinedType` when reading Parquet files with the vectorized reader. UDTs mostly consist of data types that vectorized reader could support so it would be good to enable it for UDTs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEnables support for user-defined types in Spark similar to non-vectorized Parquet reader.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to create two new sub-classes of the error class `INCONSISTENT_BEHAVIOR_CROSS_VERSION`:\r\n- READ_ANCIENT_DATETIME\r\n- WRITE_ANCIENT_DATETIME\r\n\r\nand move their error messages from source code to the json file `error-classes.json`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To improve maintainability of error messages in the one place.\r\n2. To follow the general rule that bodies of error messages should be placed to the json file, and only parameters are passed from source code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite*\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39084 where calling `df.rdd.isEmpty()` on a particular dataset could result in a JVM crash and/or executor failure. \r\n\r\nThe issue was due to Python iterator not being synchronised with Java iterator so when the task is complete, the Python iterator continues to process data. We have introduced ContextAwareIterator as part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33277 but we did not fix all of the places where this should be used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added a test case that reproduces the issue 100%. I confirmed that the test fails without the fix and passes with the fix.","created_at":"2022-05-02T05:57:54Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T15:44:27Z","closed_at":"2022-05-02T23:30:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a3b04b40b21339dc6f6f35834ac3ac7332f8b32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36425/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36425/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36425/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/51ee50580a9bcc466b0e83e08520afaa0d7b09f2","head":{"label":"sadikovi:fix-pyspark-iter-2","ref":"fix-pyspark-iter-2","sha":"51ee50580a9bcc466b0e83e08520afaa0d7b09f2","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nmake `cleanAppData` atomic to prevent race condition between update and clean app data. \r\nWhen the race condition happens, it could lead to a scenario when `cleanAppData` delete the entry of \r\nApplicationInfoWrapper for an application right after it has been updated by `mergeApplicationListing`.\r\nSo there will be cases when the HS Web UI displays `Application not found` for applications whose logs does exist.\r\n\r\n#### Error message\r\n```\r\n22/04/29 17:16:21 DEBUG FsHistoryProvider: New/updated attempts found: 1

`checkForLogs` to build the application list based on the current contents of the log directory for every 10 seconds by default.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L296-L299\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L472\r\n\r\nIn each turn of execution, this method scans the specified logDir and parse the log files to update its KVStore:\r\n- detect new updated/added files to process : https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L574-L578\r\n- detect stale data to remove: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L586-L600\r\n\r\nThese 2 operations are executed in different threads as `submitLogProcessTask` uses `replayExecutor` to submit tasks.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L1389-L1401\r\n\r\n### When does the bug happen?\r\n`Application not found` error happens in the following scenario:\r\nIn the first run of `checkForLogs`, it detected a newly-added log `viewfs://iu/log/spark3/AAA_1.inprogress` (log of an in-progress application named AAA). So it will add 2 entries to the KVStore\r\n- one entry of key-value as the key is the logPath (`viewfs://iu/log/spark3/AAA_1.inprogress`)  and the value is an instance of LogInfo represented the log\r\n  -  https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L495-L505\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L545-L552\r\n- one entry of key-value as the key is the applicationId (`AAA`) and  the value is an instance of ApplicationInfoWrapper holding the information of the application.\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L825\r\n  - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L1172\r\n\r\nIn the next run of `checkForLogs`, now the AAA application has finished, the log `viewfs://iu/log/spark3/AAA_1.inprogress` has been deleted and a new log `viewfs://iu/log/spark3/AAA_1` is created. So  `checkForLogs` will do the following 2 things in 2 different threads:\r\n- Thread 1: parsing the new log `viewfs://iu/log/spark3/AAA_1` and update data in its KVStore\r\n  - add a new entry of key: `viewfs://iu/log/spark3/AAA_1` and value: an instance of LogInfo represented the log\r\n  - updated the entry with key=applicationId (`AAA`)  with new value of  an instance of ApplicationInfoWrapper (for example: the isCompleted flag now change from false to true)\r\n- Thread 2:  data related to `viewfs://iu/log/spark3/AAA_1.inprogress` is now considered as stale and it must be deleted.\r\n  - clean App data for `viewfs://iu/log/spark3/AAA_1.inprogress` https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L586-L600\r\n  - Inside `cleanAppData`, first it loads the latest information of `ApplicationInfoWrapper` from the KVStore: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L632  For most of the time, when this line is executed, Thread 1 already finished `updating the entry with key=applicationId (AAA)  with new value of  an instance of ApplicationInfoWrapper` so this condition https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L637 will be evaluated as false, so `isStale` will be false. However, in some rare cases, when Thread1 does not finish the update yet, the old data of ApplicationInfoWrapper will be load, so `isStale` will be true and it leads to deleting the entry of ApplicationInfoWrapper in KVStore: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L656-L662 and the worst thing is it delete the entry right after when Thread 1 has finished updating the entry with key=applicationId (`AAA`)  with new value of  an instance of ApplicationInfoWrapper. So the entry for the ApplicationInfoWrapper of applicationId= `AAA` is removed forever then when users access the Web UI for this application, and `Application not found` is shown up while the log for the app does exist.\r\n\r\nSo here we make the `cleanAppData` method atomic just like the `addListing` method https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L1172 so that\r\n- If Thread 1 gets the lock on the `listing` before Thread 2, it will update the entry for the application, so in Thread2 `isStale` will be false, the entry for the application will not be removed from KVStore\r\n- If Thread 2 gets the lock on the `listing` before Thread 1, then `isStale` will be true, the entry for the application will be removed from KVStore but after that it will be added again by Thread 1.\r\nIn both case, the entry for the application will not be deleted unexpectedly from KVStore.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the bug causing HS Web UI to display `Application not found` for applications whose logs does exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, bug fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test.\r\nDeployed in our Spark HS and the `java.util.NoSuchElementException` exception does not happen anymore.\r\n`Application not found` error does not happen

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nForbid dot in V2 catalog name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the following configuration, we define 2 catalogs `test`, `test.cat`.\r\n```\r\nspark.sql.catalog.test=CatalogTestImpl\r\nspark.sql.catalog.test.k1=v1\r\nspark.sql.catalog.test.cat=CatalogTestImpl\r\nspark.sql.catalog.test.cat.k1=v1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, three keys will be treated to `test`'s configuration, it's a little bit weird.\r\n```\r\nk1=v1\r\ncat=CatalogTestImpl\r\ncat.k1=v1\r\n```\r\n\r\nBesides, the current implementation of `SHOW CATALOGS` use lazy load strategy, it's not friendly for GUI client like DBeaver to display available catalog list, w/o this restriction, it is hard to find the catalog key in configuration to load catalogs eagerly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, previously Spark allows the catalog name contain `.` but not after this change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, `Offset` must work with `Limit`. The behavior not allow to use offset alone and add offset API into `DataFrame`.\r\n\r\nIf we use `Offset` alone, there are two situations:\r\n1. If `Offset` is the last operator, collect the result to the driver and then drop/skip the first n (offset value) rows. Users can test or debug `Offset` in the way.\r\n2. If `Offset` is the intermediate operator, shuffle all the result to one task and drop/skip the first n (offset value) rows and the result will be passed to the downstream operator.\r\n\r\nFor example, `SELECT * FROM a offset 10; ` parsed to the logic plan as below:\r\n```\r\nOffset (offset = 10) // Only offset clause\r\n|--Relation\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then the physical plan as below:\r\n```\r\nCollectLimitExec(limit = -1, offset = 10) // Collect the result to the driver and skip the first 10 rows\r\n|--JDBCRelation\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimitAndOffsetExec(limit = -1, offset = 10) // Collect the result and skip the first 10 rows\r\n|--JDBCRelation\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR merged, users could input the SQL show below:\r\n```\r\nSELECT '' AS ten, unique1, unique2, stringu1\r\n \t\tFROM onek\r\n \t\tORDER BY unique1 OFFSET 990;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35975 supports offset clause, it create a logical node named \r\n`GlobalLimitAndOffset`.

/ skew / kurtosis`.\r\n\r\nSee decision details at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IHUQkSVMPWiK8Jhe0GUtMHnDS6LB4_z9K2ktWmORSSg/edit#heading=h.iom65pc8gqiv.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWith statistical functions standardized, pandas API coverage will be increased since missing parameters `skipna`s are implemented. That would further improve user adoption.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. `skipna` is supported in common statistical functions of DataFrame and Series.\r\n\r\nTake `sum` for example,\r\n```py\r\n>>> psdf = ps.DataFrame({\"a\": [np.nan, np.nan, np.nan], \"b\": [1, np.nan, 2]})\r\n>>> psdf\r\n    a    b                                                                      \r\n0 NaN  1.0\r\n1 NaN  NaN\r\n2 NaN  2.0\r\n\r\n>>> psdf.sum(skipna=False)\r\na   NaN\r\nb   NaN\r\ndtype: float64\r\n\r\n>>> psdf.sum(skipna=True)\r\na    0.0\r\nb    3.0\r\ndtype: float64\r\n\r\n>>> psdf.b.sum(skipna=False)\r\nnan\r\n\r\n>>> psdf.b.sum(skipna=True)\r\n3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe CI should not fail when there are no test result files to be downloaded.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe CI workflow \"Report test results\" fails when there are no artifacts to be downloaded from the triggering workflow. In some situations, the triggering workflow is not skipped, but all test jobs are skipped in case no code changes are detected.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- https://github.com/G-Research/spark/runs/6208072225?check_suite_focus=true#step:4:14\r\n- https://github.com/G-Research/spark/runs/6094719451?check_suite_focus=true#step:4:14\r\n\r\nIn that situation, no test files are uploaded, which makes the triggered workflow fail.\r\n\r\nDownloading no test files can have two reasons:\r\n1. The code has been build but no tests have been executed, or tests have been executed but no test files have been generated.\r\n3. No code has been built and tested deliberately.\r\n\r\nYou want to be notified in the first situation to fix the CI. Therefore, CI should fail when code is built and tests are run but no test result files are been found.\r\n\r\nThe `dawidd6/action-download-artifact` action cannot be configured to not fail when there are no files. But Github Actions can be configured (`continue-on-error`) to ignore that and still have the job succeed. However, if that action fails for a different reason, this will not be raised as an error any more.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark DS V2 supports push down `Limit` operator to data source.\r\nBut the behavior only controlled by `pushDownList` option.\r\nIf the limit is very large, then Executor will pull all the result set from data source.\r\nSo it will cause the memory issue as you know.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove DS V2 Limit push-down\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\nDS V2 Limit push-down also decided by `maxPushDownLimit` option.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-29T08:37:43Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T09:59:27Z","closed_at":"2022-05-27T09:59:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f66e831c179098534bd496316482d7b93b64e1d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36405/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36405/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36405/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/54ad1a6beb69670f2b4621d77aa6b1748e6aeebe","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-39065","ref":"SPARK-39065","sha":"54ad1a6beb69670f2b4621d77aa6b1748e6aeebe","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter SPARK-38896, all `LevelDBIterator` handles opened by `LevelDB#view(Class<T> type)` method have been closed by `tryWithResource` mechanism, the way of close `LevelDBIterator` handles through `finalize()` mechanism is redundant, so this pr remove the `finalize()` method and related codes from `LevelDB` and `LevelDBIterator`. At the same time, this pr also cleans up similar code in `RocksDB` and `RocksDBIterator`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up redundant code related to `finalize()` from `LevelDB/RocksDBIterator` \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`DeleteFromTable` has been in Spark for a long time and there are existing Spark extensions to compile `DeleteFromTable` to physical plans. However, the new analyzer rule `RewriteDeleteFromTable` fails very early if the v2 table does not support delete. This breaks certain Spark extensions which can still execute `DeleteFromTable` for certain v2 tables.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply removes the error throwing in `RewriteDeleteFromTable`. It's a safe change because:\r\n1. the new delete-related rules only match v2 table with `SupportsRowLevelOperations`, so won't be affected by this change\r\n2. the planner rule will fail eventually if the v2 table doesn't support deletion. Spark eagerly executes commands so Spark users can still see this error immediately.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo not break existing Spark extesions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, `Offset` must work with `Limit`. The behavior not allow to use offset alone and add offset API into `DataFrame`.\r\n\r\nIf we use `Offset` alone, there are two situations:\r\n1. If `Offset` is the last operator, collect the result to the driver and then drop/skip the first n (offset value) rows. Users can test or debug `Offset` in the way.\r\n2. If `Offset` is the intermediate operator, shuffle all the result to one task and drop/skip the first n (offset value) rows and the the result will be passed to the downstream operator. If offset value is bigger, the overhead looks not good, so we not supports the situation.\r\n\r\nFor example, `SELECT * FROM a offset 10; ` parsed to the logic plan as below:\r\n```\r\nOffset (offset = 10) // Only offset clause\r\n|--Relation\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then the physical plan as below:\r\n```\r\nCollectOffsetExec (offset = 10) // Collect the result to the driver and skip the first 10 rows\r\n|--JDBCRelation\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR merged, users could input the SQL show below:\r\n```\r\nSELECT '' AS ten, unique1, unique2, stringu1\r\n \t\tFROM onek\r\n \t\tORDER BY unique1 OFFSET 990;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLet `Offset` could work without `Limit`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-28T10:58:36Z","updated_at":"2022-05-10T10:14:53Z","closed_at":"2022-05-10T10:14:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39fb516904d19e5cb0c9e2768ed6d5f52c4d0b76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36394/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36394/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36394/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/898753b9e579cd69995e51056b910cc5c5a93b45","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-39057","ref":"SPARK-39057","sha":"898753b9e579cd69995e51056b910cc5c5a93b45","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to remove the `ILLEGAL_SUBSTRING` error class, and use `INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE` in the case when the `strfmt` parameter of the `format_string()` function contains `%0$`. The last value is handled differently by JDKs:  _\"... Java 8 and Java 11 uses it as \"%1$\", and Java 17 throws IllegalFormatArgumentIndexException(Illegal format argument index = 0)\"_.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36380.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance and user experience with Spark SQL by reducing the number of user-facing error classes. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing error message.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select format_string('%0$s', 'Hello');\r\nError in query: [ILLEGAL_SUBSTRING] The argument_index of string format cannot contain position 0$.; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select format_string('%0$s', 'Hello');\r\nError in query: [INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE] The value of parameter(s) 'strfmt' in `format_string` is invalid: expects %1$, %2$ and so on, but got %0$.; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z text.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\n(cherry picked from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is sort of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/54fcaafb094e299f21c18370fddb4a727c88d875. `Literal.create` should also support `Char` too.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the support of external type `Char` same as `Literla.apply`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this isn't exposed to users. `Literal.create(Char, StringType)` isn't also used in the current codebase internally. This PR is just for completeness.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`Groupby._reduce_for_stat_function` is a common helper function leveraged by multiple statistical functions of GroupBy objects.\r\n\r\nIt defines parameters `only_numeric` and `bool_as_numeric` to control accepted Spark types.\r\n\r\nTo be consistent with pandas API, we may also have to introduce `str_as_numeric` for `sum` for example.\r\n\r\nInstead of introducing parameters designated for each Spark type, the PR is proposed to introduce a parameter `accepted_spark_types` to specify accepted types of Spark columns to be aggregated.\r\n\r\nThat makes the helper function more extensible and clearer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code extensibility and readability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to remove the `ILLEGAL_SUBSTRING` error class, and use `INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE` in the case when the `strfmt` parameter of the `format_string()` function contains `%0$`. The last value is handled differently by JDKs:  _\"... Java 8 and Java 11 uses it as \"%1$\", and Java 17 throws IllegalFormatArgumentIndexException(Illegal format argument index = 0)\"_.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance and user experience with Spark SQL by reducing the number of user-facing error classes. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing error message.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select format_string('%0$s', 'Hello');\r\nError in query: [ILLEGAL_SUBSTRING] The argument_index of string format cannot contain position 0$.; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select format_string('%0$s', 'Hello');\r\nError in query: [INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE] The value of parameter(s) 'strfmt' in `format_string` is invalid: expects %1$, %2$ and so on, but got %0$.; line 1 pos 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z text.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor the query context `TreeNode.origin.context`, this PR proposal to return an empty context string if \r\n* the query text/ the start index/ the stop index is missing\r\n* the start index is less than 0\r\n* the stop index is larger than the length of query text\r\n* the start index is larger than the stop index\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere are downstream projects that depend on Spark. There is no guarantee for the correctness of TreeNode.origin. Developers may create a plan/expression with a Origin containing wrong startIndex/stopIndex/sqlText. \r\nThus, to avoid errors in calling `String.substring` or showing misleading debug information, I suggest returning an empty context string if TreeNode.origin is wrongly set. The query context is just for better error messages and we should handle it cautiously.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the context framework is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProvide a way to resolve aggregates in `Sort` nodes if the query also contains `HAVING` by:\r\n\r\n* Preventing premature `Project` nodes before sorting\r\n* Allow resolving aggregates in `Sort` nodes even if there is a `Filter` node (introduced by `HAVING`) between the `Sort` and the `Aggregate`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nResolve aggregate correctly in sorting/ordering nodes in plan even if the query contains `HAVING`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nQueries that contain aggregates, `HAVING`, and sorting/ordering should now resolve correctly, and work as expected.\r\n\r\nExamples (see SPARK-39022):\r\n```\r\nSELECT hotel FROM test GROUP BY hotel HAVING sum(price) > 150 ORDER BY sum(price)\r\nSELECT hotel, sum(price) FROM test GROUP BY hotel HAVING sum(price) > 150 ORDER BY sum(price)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing of examples provided in SPARK-39022.\r\nAdditional similar unit tests added in `AnalysisSuite`.\r\n\r\nRun unit test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"catalyst/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.AnalysisSuite -- -z SPARK-39022\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAffected modified tests (see SPARK-39022):\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRespect NaNvl in EquivalentExpressions for expression elimination.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor example the query will fail:\r\n```sql\r\nset spark.sql.ansi.enabled=true;\r\nset spark.sql.optimizer.excludedRules=org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.ConstantFolding;\r\nSELECT nanvl(1, 1/0 + 1/0);  \r\n```\r\n```sql\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 4.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 4.0 (TID 4) (10.221.98.68 executor driver): org.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: divide by zero.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36351\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the the usage of `toSQLValue(v)` without an explicit type.\r\n\r\n`Literal(v)` is intended to be used from end-users so it cannot handle our internal types such as `UTF8String` and `ArrayBasedMapData`. Using this method can lead to unexpected error messages such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkRuntimeException: [UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE] The feature is not supported: literal for 'hair' of class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String.\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.literalTypeUnsupportedError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:241)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Literal$.apply(literals.scala:99)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryErrorsBase.toSQLValue(QueryErrorsBase.scala:45)\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince It is impossible to have the corresponding data type from the internal types as one type can map to multiple external types (e.g., `Long` for `Timestamp`, `TimestampNTZ`, and `LongType`), the removal approach was taken.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo provide the error messages as intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.Row\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.StringType\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.DataTypes\r\n\r\nval arrayStructureData = Seq(\r\nRow(Map(\"hair\"->\"black\", \"eye\"->\"brown\")),\r\nRow(Map(\"hair\"->\"blond\", \"eye\"->\"blue\")),\r\nRow(Map()))\r\n\r\nval mapType  = DataTypes.createMapType(StringType, StringType)\r\n\r\nval arrayStructureSchema = new StructType().add(\"properties\", mapType)\r\n\r\nval mapTypeDF = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    spark.sparkContext.parallelize(arrayStructureData),arrayStructureSchema)\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\", true)\r\nmapTypeDF.selectExpr(\"element_at(properties, 'hair')\").show\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkRuntimeException: [UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE] The feature is not supported: literal for 'hair' of class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String.\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.literalTypeUnsupportedError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:241)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Literal$.apply(literals.scala:99)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryErrorsBase.toSQLValue(QueryErrorsBase.scala:45)\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkNoSuchElementException: [MAP_KEY_DOES_NOT_EXIST] Key 'hair' does not exist. To return NULL instead, use 'try_element_at'. If necessary set spark.sql.ansi.enabled to false to bypass this error.\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 0) ==\r\nelement_at(properties, 'hair')\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest was added. Otherwise, existing test cases should

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR is mainly refactoring, aiming to support TimestampNTZ/LTZ at the same time in the future for the thrift server.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, in spark, we have hive dependencies, which can be classified into two types:\r\n- as a client, for accessing hive metastore/storage, etc, which is now v2.3.9, better to stay in a stable low version to be supported by higher hive metastore servers with backward compatibility\r\n- as a server, for being accessed by Hive JDBC/Thrift client, e.g. beeline, which is now v3.1.2, better to have a higher version to support more clients\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that we now convert spark results to `org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.thrift.Type` first and then to `org.apache.hive.service.rpc.thrift.TTypeId`. the former does not have 2 timestamp types, namely, doesn't have `TIMESTAMPLOCALTZ_TYPE`.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, we take a shortcut to map spark results to thrift schema and rowset directly. \r\n\r\nBesides, it also can avoid some unnecessary memory copies from type to type.\r\n\r\nMost functionalities have been verified in [apache/kyuubi](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kyuubi) for several years.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nfor supporting more spark datatypes through hive jdbc\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nexisting ut shall be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `\"Report test results\"` workflow should be skipped when the triggering workflow completed with conclusion `'skipped'`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `\"Report test results\"` workflow is triggered when either `\"Build and test\"` or `\"Build and test (ANSI)\"` complete. On fork repositories, workflow `\"Build and test (ANSI)\"` is always skipped.\r\n\r\nThe triggered `\"Report test results\"` workflow downloads artifacts from the triggering workflow and errors because there are none artifacts.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIn personal repo:\r\n-

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue of reading null columns with the vectorised Parquet reader when the entire column is null or does not exist. This is especially noticeable when performing a merge or schema evolution in Parquet.\r\n\r\nThe issue is only exposed with the `OffHeapColumnVector` which does not handle `isAllNull` flag - `OnHeapColumnVector` already handles `isAllNull` so everything works fine there.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe change is needed to correctly read null columns using the vectorised reader in the off-heap mode.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI updated the existing unit tests to ensure we cover off-heap mode. I confirmed that the tests pass with the fix and fail without.","created_at":"2022-04-26T23:28:16Z","updated_at":"2022-04-27T03:48:29Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T03:45:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26327b277370693ae968eecce982f25ceabbe68c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36366/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36366/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36366/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/147c550545dc90ebd02f70c6882bf4345ef7c107","head":{"label":"sadikovi:fix-off-heap-cv","ref":"fix-off-heap-cv","sha":"147c550545dc90ebd02f70c6882bf4345ef7c107","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60595889,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU5NTg4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sadikovi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the `to_char` and `try_to_char` SQL function expressions according to new semantics described below. The former is equivalent to the latter except that it throws an exception instead of returning NULL for cases where the input decimal value does not match the format string.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n# `try_to_char` function\r\n\r\nReturns Decimal-typed `expr` cast to STRING using formatting `fmt`, or `NULL` if `expr` is not a valid match for the given format.\r\n\r\n## Syntax\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry_to_char(expr, fmt)\r\nfmt\r\n  { ' [ S ] [ L | $ ] \r\n      [ 0 | 9 | G | , ] [...] \r\n      [ . | D ] \r\n      [ 0 | 9 ] [...] \r\n      [ L | $ ] [ PR | MI | S ] ' }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Arguments\r\n\r\n- `expr`: A DECIMAL expression representing a number. `expr` may include leading or trailing spaces.\r\n- `fmt`: An STRING literal, specifying the expected format of `expr`.\r\n\r\n## Returns\r\n\r\nA STRING representing the result of the formatting operation.\r\n\r\n`fmt` can contain the following elements (case insensitive):\r\n\r\n```\r\n'0' or '9':\r\n\r\nSpecifies an expected digit between 0 and 9. A sequence of 0 or 9 in the format\r\nstring matches a sequence of digits in the input value, generating a result string\r\nof the same length as the corresponding sequence in the format string. The result\r\nstring is left-padded with zeros if the 0/9 sequence comprises more digits than the\r\nmatching part of the decimal value, starts with 0, and is before the decimal point.\r\nOtherwise, it is padded with spaces.\r\n\r\n'.' or 'D':\r\n\r\nSpecifies the position of the decimal point (optional, only allowed once).\r\n\r\n',' or 'G':\r\n\r\nSpecifies the position of the grouping (thousands) separator (,). There must be a\r\n0 or 9 to the left and right of each grouping separator.\r\n\r\n'$':\r\n\r\nSpecifies the location of the $ currency sign. This character may only be specified once.\r\n\r\n'S' or 'MI':\r\n\r\nSpecifies the position of a '-' or '+' sign (optional, only allowed once at the\r\nbeginning or end of the format string). Note that 'S' prints '+' for positive values\r\nbut 'MI' prints a space.\r\n\r\n'PR':\r\n\r\nOnly allowed at the end of the format string; specifies that the result string will\r\nbe wrapped by angle brackets if the input value is negative.  ('<1>').\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `expr` contains any characters other than `0` through `9` and those permitted in `fmt` a `NULL` is returned.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- The format expects:\r\n--  * an optional sign at the beginning,\r\n--  * followed by a dollar sign,\r\n--  * followed by a number between 3 and 6 digits long,\r\n--  * thousands separators,\r\n--  * up to two dights beyond the decimal point. \r\nExamples:\r\n> SELECT try_to_char(Decimal(454), '999');\r\n\"454\"\r\n> SELECT try_to_char(Decimal(454.00), '000.00');\r\n\"454.00\"\r\n> SELECT try_to_char(Decimal(12454), '99,999');\r\n\"12,454\"\r\n> SELECT try_to_char(Decimal(78.12), '$99.99');\r\n\"$78.12\"\r\n> SELECT try_to_char(Decimal(-12454.8), '99,999.9S');\r\n\"12,454.8-\"\r\n> SELECT try_to_char(Decimal(12454.8), '99,999.9S');\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe new semantics bring Spark into consistency with other engines and grant the user flexibility about how to handle cases where inputs do not match the format string.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n* The minus sign `-` is no longer supported in the format string (`S` replaces it).\r\n* `MI` and `PR` are new options in the format string.\r\n* `to_number` and `try_to_number` are separate functions with different error behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* New positive and negative unit tests cover both `to_char` and `try_to_char` functions.\r\n* Query tests update as needed according to the behavior changes.","created_at":"2022-04-26T21:14:28Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T03:37:42Z","closed_at":"2022-05-13T03:37:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6862c392ef0619671a01e5166379b240c3cc07ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36365/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36365/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36365/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/651a35e486ef712609fa7be53aa09742750da672","head":{"label":"dtenedor:to-char","ref":"to-char","sha":"651a35e486ef712609fa7be53aa09742750da672","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c770daa9d468cf2c3cda117904478996cd88ebb9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to output any SQL statement in error messages in upper case, and apply new implementation of `QueryErrorsBase.toSQLStmt()` to all exceptions in `Query.*Errors` w/ error classes. Also this PR modifies all affected tests, see the list in the section \"How was this patch tested?\".\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36359.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL by highlighting SQL statements in error massage and make them more visible to users. Also this PR makes SQL statements in error messages consistent to the docs where such elements are showed in upper case w/ any quotes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The changes might influence on error messages:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nThe operation \"DESC PARTITION\" is not allowed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nThe operation DESC PARTITION is not allowed\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to output any SQL statement in error messages in upper case, and apply new implementation of `QueryErrorsBase.toSQLStmt()` to all exceptions in `Query.*Errors` w/ error classes. Also this PR modifies all affected tests, see the list in the section \"How was this patch tested?\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL by highlighting SQL statements in error massage and make them more visible to users. Also this PR makes SQL statements in error messages consistent to the docs where such elements are showed in upper case w/ any quotes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The changes might influence on error messages:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nThe operation \"DESC PARTITION\" is not allowed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nThe operation DESC PARTITION is not allowed\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryParsingErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsDSv2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd Inter-Pod anti-affinity to Executor Pod.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n### Why should we need this?\r\n\r\nWhen Spark On Kubernetes is running, Executor Pod clusters occur in certain conditions (uneven resource allocation in Kubernetes, high load On some nodes, low load On some nodes), causing Shuffle data skew. This causes Spark application to fail or performance bottlenecks, such as Shuffle Fetch timeout and connection refuse after connection number.\r\n\r\n### How does this PR help?\r\n\r\nAdd the AntiAffinity feature to Executor Pod to ensure simple anti-affinity scheduling at Application granularity.\r\n\r\nExecutor Pod Yaml represents:\r\n```yaml\r\npodAntiAffinity:\r\n  preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\r\n  weight: 100\r\n  - podAffinityTerm:\r\n       labelSelector:\r\n         matchExpressions: \r\n         - key: spark-app-selector \r\n            operator: In \r\n            values: \r\n            - spark-test // appId\r\n       topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why should use this?\r\n\r\nThe functionality mentioned in this PR was tested on a cluster.\r\n\r\nUsing three Kubernetes Node(node-1, node-2, node-3).\r\n\r\nIn the case of sufficient or insufficient cluster resources, it  has the same effect Whether the feature is enabled or not. Kubernetes assigns pods to nodes with low load based on global resources. When only one node has a small load, Kubernetes will schedule all executor pods to this node. \r\n\r\nHere is the experiment  results:\r\n(Experiments show pods are scheduled to which node)\r\n\r\nExperiment 1:\r\nThree nodes hold a small amount of equal load.\r\n\r\nEnable Feature:\r\n| round | exec-1 | exec-2 | exec-3 | exec-4 | exec-5 | exec-6 | exec-7 |\r\n| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| 1     | node-1 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-1 | node-3 | node-1 |\r\n| 2     | node-1 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-1 | node-3 | node-1 |\r\n| 3     | node-1 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-1 | node-3 | node-1 |\r\n| 4     | node-1 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-1 | node-3 | node-1 |\r\n\r\nDisable Feature:\r\n| round | exec-1 | exec-2 | exec-3 | exec-4 | exec-5 | exec-6 | exec-7 |\r\n| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| 1     | node-1 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-1 | node-3 | node-1 |\r\n| 2     | node-1 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-1 | node-3 | node-1 |\r\n| 3     | node-1 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-1 | node-3 | node-1 |\r\n| 4     | node-1 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-1 | node-3 | node-1 |\r\n\r\nExperiment 2:\r\nNode 1 have no idle resources, Node 2 and Node 3 hold a small amount of equal load.\r\n\r\nEnable Feature:\r\n| round | exec-1 | exec-2 | exec-3 | exec-4 |\r\n| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| 1     | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 |\r\n| 1     | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 |\r\n| 1     | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 |\r\n| 1     | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 |\r\n\r\nDisable Feature:\r\n| round | exec-1 | exec-2 | exec-3 | exec-4 |\r\n| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| 1     | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 |\r\n| 1     | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 |\r\n| 1     | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 |\r\n| 1     | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf some nodes are busy or the load is unbalanced, leaving the feature off means that Kubernetes will pick the Node with the lowest load and distribute it until it is no longer the one with the lowest load. After the feature is enabled, it is first allocated to nodes with low load, and then allocated to nodes with low load except hassan according to the anti-affinity of Application granularity.\r\n\r\nExperiment 2:\r\nNode 1 have no idle resources, Node 2 has a higher load than Node 3.\r\n\r\nEnable Feature:\r\n| round | exec-1 | exec-2 | exec-3 | exec-4 |\r\n| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| 1     | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 |\r\n| 2     | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 |\r\n| 3     | node-3 | node-2 | node-3 | node-2 |\r\n\r\nDisable Feature:\r\n| round | exec-1 | exec-2 | exec-3 | exec-4 |\r\n| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\r\n| 1     | node-3 | node-3 | node-3 | node-3 |\r\n| 2     | node-3 | node-3 | node-3 | node-3 |\r\n| 3     | node-3 | node-3 | node-3 | node-3 |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAccording to the above experimental results, we can see that under normal circumstances, after the feature is turned on, there will not be any difference from that when it is not turned on; In extreme cases, after enabling the feature, it can better alleviate the accumulation of Pods On a Node and prevent performance bottleneck to a certain extent.\r\n\r\n### Will this make any difference?\r\n\r\nAdd features to apply for the Executor of Pod add `AntiAffinity PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoreedDuringExecution`, Used to add the Application granularity Preferred antiaffinity based on Kubernetes' global resource-oriented (and other customized scheduling policies). We hope Kubernetes can help us smooth out ExecutorPod from the Application level as much as possible while adhering to the original scheduling rules.\r\n\r\n### Why choose this?\r\n\r\n> Why choose Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity?\r\n\r\nWe are currently concerned with gathering distribution between pods.\r\n\r\n>Why choose PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoreedDuringExecution?\r\n\r\nAccording to the Kubernetes [Assigning Pods To Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity)，can see that Kubernetes provides us with `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` & `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`。\r\n\r\n-   `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`: The scheduler can't schedule the Pod unless the rule is met. This functions like `nodeSelector`, but with a more expressive syntax.\r\n\r\n-   `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`: The scheduler tries to find a node that meets the rule. If a matching node is not available, the scheduler still schedules the Pod.\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to see，`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` is more in line with the issues we raised in this PR. We want Kubernetes to help smooth out Executor pods as much as possible, but in the worst case, where there is only one Node with resources left, we also need to be able to allocate Executor pods to that one Node.\r\n\r\n>Why would we want to influence Kubernetes scheduling from Spark code?\r\n\r\nWe need to antiaffinity executorPods from the granularity of the Application, so we choose to add the antiaffinity  before allocating the Executor and after generating applicationId.\r\n\r\nDue to the ApplicationId limitation, we could not pin it to the `pod-template.yaml`.\r\n\r\n> What are the negative effects?\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of normal scheduling policy, there is no great negative impact. From experiments and theories, it can be known that the new feature will not affect the existing scheduling content. \r\n\r\nHowever, to some extent, breaking Executor pods will affect the localization of Shuffle data, that is, the number of blocks in LocalHost will be reduced.\r\n\r\nJudging from the experiments and results so far, this trade-off is worthwhile.\r\n\r\nIf we do not adopt the strategy of breaking up executors, they will gather under certain circumstances, leading to Shuffle data skews and significantly affecting task performance. More seriously, after the connection number is full, Executor Fetch Block fails and Stage fails. Even Application failure.\r\n\r\nBreaking executors increases network connectivity and traffic at the cluster level. However, the increased consumption is scattered in the cluster and not concentrated on several nodes, so the overall stability is acceptable.\r\n\r\n> Why does changing the number of Executor Pods affect Shuffle Data skew?\r\n\r\nThe number of Executor Pods is related to the amount of Shuffle data. Currently, the Shuffle tilt problem can be alleviated by controlling the number of Executor Pods.\r\n\r\nAt present, this is only a step of anti-affinity reference, and later may be carried out directly through shuffle quantity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

pandas will refresh dtypes according to categories, since panda 1.4, `categories.setter` dtype refresh will not work. According to https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/46820 , the complete support of `categories.setter` will never back.\r\n\r\nAnd also only categories is refreshed (but dtype not) is useless

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the the usage of `toSQLValue(v)` without an explicit type.\r\n\r\n`Literal(v)` is intended to be used from end-users so it cannot handle our internal types such as `UTF8String` and `ArrayBasedMapData`. Using this method can lead to unexpected error messages such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkRuntimeException: [UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE] The feature is not supported: literal for 'hair' of class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String.\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.literalTypeUnsupportedError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:241)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Literal$.apply(literals.scala:99)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryErrorsBase.toSQLValue(QueryErrorsBase.scala:45)\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince It is impossible to have the corresponding data type from the internal types as one type can map to multiple external types (e.g., `Long` for `Timestamp`, `TimestampNTZ`, and `LongType`), the removal approach was taken.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo provide the error messages as intended.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.Row\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.StringType\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.DataTypes\r\n\r\nval arrayStructureData = Seq(\r\nRow(Map(\"hair\"->\"black\", \"eye\"->\"brown\")),\r\nRow(Map(\"hair\"->\"blond\", \"eye\"->\"blue\")),\r\nRow(Map()))\r\n\r\nval mapType  = DataTypes.createMapType(StringType, StringType)\r\n\r\nval arrayStructureSchema = new StructType().add(\"properties\", mapType)\r\n\r\nval mapTypeDF = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    spark.sparkContext.parallelize(arrayStructureData),arrayStructureSchema)\r\n\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\", true)\r\nmapTypeDF.selectExpr(\"element_at(properties, 'hair')\").show\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkRuntimeException: [UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE] The feature is not supported: literal for 'hair' of class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String.\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.literalTypeUnsupportedError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:241)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Literal$.apply(literals.scala:99)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryErrorsBase.toSQLValue(QueryErrorsBase.scala:45)\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkNoSuchElementException: [MAP_KEY_DOES_NOT_EXIST] Key 'hair' does not exist. To return NULL instead, use 'try_element_at'. If necessary set spark.sql.ansi.enabled to false to bypass this error.\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 0) ==\r\nelement_at(properties, 'hair')\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest was added. Otherwise, existing test cases should cover.","created_at":"2022-04-26T05:23:50Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:50:28Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T08:52:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8cf0da242ef842fbfc0e7a43ca6f8390db8e454","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02ac8736e413118302c1bc35845ae3da21675a80","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-39015","ref":"SPARK-39015","sha":"02ac8736e413118302c1bc35845ae3da21675a80","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror
