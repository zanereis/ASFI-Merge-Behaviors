After the pull request is submitted, please request code reviews from [Reviewers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md#reviewers) by @ them in the pull request thread.\r\n\r\nWhen I use Realy VM and the newshape of Reshape is [1, -1, 0] (the -1 is behind 0), the output shape is wrong. The test code is as follows:\r\n```\r\nimport tvm \r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ntarget = \"llvm\"\r\ndtype = \"float32\"\r\nexecutor_kind = \"vm\"\r\ndev = tvm.runtime.ndarray.device(str(target), 0)\r\n\r\ndef build_module(x_shape, new_shape):\r\n    x = relay.var(\"x\", shape=x_shape, dtype=dtype)\r\n    y = relay.reshape(x, newshape=new_shape)\r\n    func = relay.Function([x], y)\r\n    mod = tvm.ir.IRModule.from_expr(func)\r\n    print(\"mod:\", mod)\r\n    executable = relay.vm.compile(mod, target)\r\n    vm = tvm.runtime.vm.VirtualMachine(executable, dev)\r\n    return vm\r\n\r\ndef run(vm, x_np_shape):\r\n    x_np = np.random.uniform(size=x_np_shape).astype('float32')\r\n    z = vm.run(x_np)\r\n    print(\"tvm input:\", x_np.shape)\r\n    print(\"tvm output:\", z.numpy().shape)\r\n    print(\"\")\r\n\r\ndef test(new_shape):\r\n    vm = build_module([relay.Any(), relay.Any(), relay.Any()], new_shape=new_shape)\r\n    run(vm, (2, 3, 4)) \r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    test(new_shape=[0, 1, -1]) # correct\r\n    test(new_shape=[0, -1, 1]) # correct\r\n    test(new_shape=[1, -1, 0]) # wrong\r\n    test(new_shape=[-1, 1, 0]) # wrong\r\n```\r\nThe output is\r\n```\r\nmod: def @main(%x: Tensor[(?, ?, ?), float32]) {\r\n  reshape(%x, newshape=[0, 1, -1])\r\n}\r\n\r\ntvm input: (2, 3, 4)\r\ntvm output: (2, 1, 12)\r\n\r\nmod: def @main(%x: Tensor[(?, ?, ?), float32]) {\r\n  reshape(%x, newshape=[0, -1, 1])\r\n}\r\n\r\ntvm input: (2, 3, 4)\r\ntvm output: (2, 12, 1)\r\n\r\nmod: def @main(%x: Tensor[(?, ?, ?), float32]) {\r\n  reshape(%x, newshape=[1, -1, 0])\r\n}\r\n\r\ntvm input: (2, 3, 4)\r\ntvm output: (1, 8, 3)\r\n\r\nmod: def @main(%x: Tensor[(?, ?, ?), float32]) {\r\n  reshape(%x, newshape=[-1, 1, 0])\r\n}\r\n\r\ntvm input: (2, 3, 4)\r\ntvm output: (8, 1, 3)\r\n```\r\nThe problem is derived from https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/python/tvm/relay/op/_transform.py#L420, where only `dst_idx` increases but `src_idx` does not. After fix it, the output shape is correct:\r\n```\r\nmod: def @main(%x: Tensor[(?, ?, ?), float32]) {\r\n  reshape(%x, newshape=[0, 1, -1])\r\n}\r\n\r\ntvm input: (2, 3, 4)\r\ntvm output: (2, 1,

https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/10692\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, we can either remove this pass from `relay.build(...)` pipeline or run `DynamicToStatic` in both VM and non-VM paths. I propose to remove it because  (1) usually `DynamicToStatic` is supposed to be applied after model import and (2) the only case running `DynamicToStatic` during `relay.build(...)` helps is when the input is entirely static but a frontend fails to produce a static mod AND a user forgets to run `DynamicToStatic` after model import.\r\n\r\n I hope the latter case happens rarely but if not, that's something we should fix in the frontend side. We should avoid relying on `DynamicToStatic` that runs during `relay.build(...)` since not all use cases of TVM use `relay.build(...)` (BYOC, for example).","created_at":"2022-03-20T21:49:51Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T00:44:17Z","closed_at":"2022-03-23T00:44:17Z","merged_at":"2022-03-23T00:44:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"4c608be12a80594cefc4c81a0dc62d7069be1971","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10691/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10691/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/10691/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/adcbf9675fca8a0855641fe2136cf014a8061c92","head":{"label":"masahi:remove-dyn-to-static","ref":"remove-dyn-to-static","sha":"adcbf9675fca8a0855641fe2136cf014a8061c92","user":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138661036,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg2NjEwMzY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"masahi/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/masahi/tvm","description":"Open

doing layout optimization for slice, if `start` or `end` are divisibly by the pack factor and `stride=1`, a `layout_transform` can be saved.

resolves a bug introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9727, and adds a test to catch this failure mode.  This bug occurred because StorageFlatten's visitor for PrefetchNode inserted additional pre-flattened `BufferLoad` nodes after visiting the body of the Prefetch, preventing those `BufferLoad` nodes from being flattened.  Moving this visit to after the insertion of the `BufferLoad` nodes allows the usual buffer flattening to apply to the newly inserted nodes.","created_at":"2022-03-17T13:46:19Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T13:36:23Z","closed_at":"2022-03-17T19:10:56Z","merged_at":"2022-03-17T19:10:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"46ac3d52456615d084d7713309bd005828e27314","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10657/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10657/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/10657/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d66ec9308370c08be8a974cde8eea62a713adb38","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:storage_flatten_prefetch","ref":"storage_flatten_prefetch","sha":"d66ec9308370c08be8a974cde8eea62a713adb38","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

employing double_buffer in tensor core conv2d template, such as:\r\n```python\r\n# conv2d_implicit_gemm_tensorcore.py\r\ndef schedule_implicit_gemm_tensorcore(cfg, sch, Conv):\r\n    ...\r\n    # double buffer\r\n    sch[AS].double_buffer()\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nIt results in such assert:\r\n```bash\r\nCheck failed: (it != buf_map_.end()) is false: Cannot find allocated buffer for buffer(im2col_reshape.shared, 0x5619189281f0)\r\n```\r\nAttached is my test script.\r\n[test_double_buffer.py.txt](https://github.com/apache/tvm/files/8332545/test_double_buffer.py.txt)\r\n\r\nAs described above, buffer `im2col_reshape.shared` will be doubled. There are several passes for lowering double_buffer. One of them is storage_flatten. The lowered tir fed to storage_flatten pass has two types of attributes include buffer `im2col_reshape.shared`.\r\n\r\n- buffer(im2col_reshape.shared, 0x55e3524f0a40), op->attr_key: double_buffer_scope\r\n- [buffer(buffer, 0x55e3524f44d0), buffer(im2col_reshape.shared, 0x55e3524f0a40)], op->attr_key: buffer_bind_scope\r\n\r\nNoticed that at the begin of this pass the pointers of buffer `im2col_reshape.shared` are same. There is a pass buffer_stride in pass storage_flatten which has such process for attribute statement.\r\n``` C++\r\n// storage_flatten.cc:BufferStrideLegalize\r\nStmt VisitStmt_(const AttrStmtNode* op) final {\r\n    if (op->attr_key == attr::buffer_dim_align) {\r\n      auto buffer = Downcast<tir::Buffer>(op->node);\r\n      const CallNode* tuple = op->value.as<CallNode>();\r\n      ICHECK(tuple && tuple->op.same_as(builtin::tvm_tuple()));\r\n      auto& vinfo = dim_align_[buffer];\r\n      int dim = tuple->args[0].as<IntImmNode>()->value;\r\n      if (static_cast<size_t>(dim) >= vinfo.size()) {\r\n        vinfo.resize(dim + 1);\r\n      }\r\n      vinfo[dim].align_factor = tuple->args[1].as<IntImmNode>()->value;\r\n      vinfo[dim].align_offset = tuple->args[2].as<IntImmNode>()->value;\r\n      return this->VisitStmt(op->body);\r\n    } else if (op->attr_key == attr::buffer_bind_scope) {\r\n      Array<ObjectRef> arr = Downcast<Array<ObjectRef>>(op->node);\r\n      ICHECK_EQ(arr.size(), 2U);\r\n      Buffer source = Downcast<Buffer>(arr[0]);\r\n      Buffer target_with_strides = WithStrides(Downcast<Buffer>(arr[1]));\r\n      Buffer source_with_strides = WithStrides(source);\r\n\r\n      {\r\n        BufferEntry entry;\r\n        entry.remap_to = source_with_strides;\r\n        entry.in_scope = true;\r\n        entry.is_external = false;\r\n        buf_map_[source] = entry;\r\n      }\r\n      Stmt body = this->VisitStmt(op->body);\r\n      return AttrStmt(Array<ObjectRef>{source_with_strides, target_with_strides}, op->attr_key,\r\n                      op->value, body, op->span);\r\n    } else {\r\n      return StmtExprMutator::VisitStmt_(op);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIn branch `op->attr_key == attr::buffer_bind_scope`, buffer `im2col_reshape.shared` is passed to `WithStrides` and modified in it. Then buffer `im2col_reshape.shared` changes to `[buffer(buffer, 0x55e3524f44d0), buffer(im2col_reshape.shared, 0x55e352500860)], op->attr_key: buffer_bind_scope`. Noticed again the pointer to `im2col_reshape.shared` is changed afterwards. And because there is none branch for processing attribute `double_buffer_scope`, this cause mismatch of pointer to buffer `im2col_reshape.shared`. \r\nSo add branch below will solve this issue.\r\n``` C++\r\n    else if (op->attr_key == attr::double_buffer_scope) {\r\n      auto buffer = Downcast<tir::Buffer>(op->node);\r\n      Buffer buffer_with_strides = WithStrides(buffer);\r\n      Stmt body = this->VisitStmt(op->body);\r\n      return AttrStmt(buffer_with_strides, op->attr_key, op->value, body, op->span);\r\n    } \r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-17T08:15:55Z","updated_at":"2022-04-17T14:47:51Z","closed_at":"2022-04-17T14:47:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ec90f4189aff49978aee5325524b5421ebaa6cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/10652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f604e9b001029d31613301269d7a581ed4f9ee03","head":{"label":"DzAvril:double_buffer","ref":"double_buffer","sha":"f604e9b001029d31613301269d7a581ed4f9ee03","user":{"login":"DzAvril","id":18597737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTk3NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18597737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril","html_url":"https://github.com/DzAvril","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469635349,"node_id":"R_kgDOG_4RFQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"DzAvril/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DzAvril","id":18597737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTk3NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18597737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril","html_url":"https://github.com/DzAvril","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DzAvril/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DzAvril/tvm","description":"Open

performance optimization for platform Xavier which has a Volta GPU in it, we found that tuning by AutoTVM with subgraph as granularity could bring performance improvement.  Because the data type of the subgraph's output may be different from the data type of the subgraph's anchor operator's output, this may change the task from memory-bound to compute-bound or change in reverse.\r\nLet's take the subgraph in the figure below as an example. If we tune with the single convolution the output data type is 'Int32' but if we tune with the subgraph the output data type is 'Int8'. The former's data size is four times the latter one. But in the actual inference, the data type is 'Int8' same as the latter one. So the best config searched by tuning with a single operator maybe not be the best for the subgraph.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18597737/158623733-9f9995d8-ca09-43af-8201-a8109c2ee1f8.png)\r\nWe also run an example to verify the theory above.\r\n- We wrote a schedule marked as ```ScheduleA``` for the subgraph above by hardcode and the latency of subgraph inferencing is 104 microseconds. Then we tuned the subgraph with single op as granularity. In the tuning log we found  ```ScheduleA``` and the latency recorded in the measurement result is 329 microseconds. \r\n- The best schedule from the tuned log in the step above is marked as ```ScheduleB``` and the latency recorded in the measurement result is 237 microseconds. The latency of subgraph inferencing with ```ScheduleB``` is 224 microseconds.\r\n\r\nFrom the example above we can tell AutoTVM would not find ```ScheduleA```,  the obvious better schedule. This means the tuning result is distorted, the distortion would be more obvious if the shape of the output became bigger.\r\nBy the way, you may have a question why we don't just tune with AutoSchedule, this is because we want to employ tensor core on Volta GPU to compute matrix multiply and auto-schedule doesn't support tensorize.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a method to tune with subgraph as granularity by AUTOTVM. As we know, tuning with a single operator we need function ```fcompute``` which computes the output tensors of the operator and function ```fschedule``` which schedules the computation. With these two functions, we can build a measurable program running on the device. So the key problem is assigning function ```fcompute``` and function ```fschedule``` for subgraph. In this PR, we use the fucntion  ```fschedule``` of the anchor operator as the subgraph's function ```fschedule```. As for function ```fcompute```, its purpose is getting output tensors of the subgraph. The function ```LowerToTECompute::Lower``` can get the output tensors of the subgraph, so we can use these tensors as output of subgraph's function ```fcompute```. \r\nThe whole process can breakdown into two major phases and it will be clearer reading with code.\r\n1. Task extracting and tuning.\r\n1.1 Select best implementation to compute output  for anchor operator and record implementation name `best_impl_name`\r\n1.2 Lower subgraph to `outputs`\r\n1.3 Create subgraph tuning task name `task_name` with subgraph name and `iotensors` extracted from `outputs`.\r\n1.4 Add subgraph task with `task_name`, `iotensors` and `best_impl_name`.\r\n1.5 Create `workload` for subgraph tuning task with `task_name` and `iotensors`.\r\n1.6 Set function `fcompute`  for subgraph by returning `outputs` .\r\n1.7 Set function `fschedule`  for subgraph by querying table with `best_impl_name`.\r\n1.8 Tune.\r\n\r\n2. Building.\r\n2.1 Apply the best history.\r\n2.2 Select best implementation to compute output for anchor operator and record implementation name `best_impl_name`\r\n2.3 Lower subgraph to `outputs`\r\n2.4 Create subgraph tuning task name `task_name` with subgraph name and `iotensors` extracted from `outputs`.\r\n2.5 Create `workload` for subgraph tuning task with `task_name` and `iotensors`.\r\n2.6 Lower schedule with the best config queried by `workload`.\r\n2.7 Codegen.\r\n\r\nIn our optimization job, employing tuning with subgraph achieved **6.3%** performance improvement.\r\n\r\n**But**,  there are two cases in which tuning with subgraph may not get better performance.\r\n\r\nCase 1: Anchor operator has more than one implementation. \r\nWe register the subgraph tuning task by `outputs` in step 1.4. No matter how many implementations the anchor operator has, step 1.1 will only pick the implementation with the highest level and return outputs computed by it. So the subgraph tuning tasks may not contain the potential best implementation.\r\n\r\nCase 2: Anchor operator's function `fcompute` needs value from config such as code block below. In step 2.2, computing output will call function `_pack_data` and the `cfg` suppose to be the best config of the subgraph. But in step 2.2 we don't know which subgraph the anchor operator belongs to yet, so we cannot get the right config from the best history and fallback to the default one. This may bring great performance regression.\r\n```python\r\ndef _pack_data(cfg, data, kernel):\r\n    n, _, ih, iw = get_const_tuple(data.shape)\r\n    oc, ic, kh, kw = get_const_tuple(kernel.shape)\r\n    ic_bn, oc_bn = cfg[\"tile_ic\"].size[-1], cfg[\"tile_oc\"].size[-1]\r\n    ......\r\n```\r\nThe cases above seem too hard to resolve in the current implementation. You're welcome to make any suggestions.

server:plex\r\n172.31.8.12:5001        server:plex\r\n172.31.8.4:5001 server:prague\r\n172.31.8.13:5001        server:plex\r\n172.31.8.5:5001 server:prague\r\n172.31.8.13:5001        server:plex\r\n----------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter my changes:\r\n```\r\nServer List\r\n------------------------------\r\nserver-address

discussion w/ @spectrometerHBH @Hzfengsy , we decide to exclude the buffer access from read regions if it's being written to inside a reduction block. In this way, the outer block would not find overlap between the region reads and writes simultaneously, thus solving the issue mentioned in #10420 .\r\n\r\nOne tricky case is how to handle opaque memory access in `GetBlockReadWriteRegion`, where we have no hint about which buffer is being written to. And I keep the original behavior that the opaque access was added to both read and write regions of a block, no matter whether it's a reduction block or
