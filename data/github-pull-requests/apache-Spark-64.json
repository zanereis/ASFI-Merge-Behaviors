What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new `ReleaseSession` Spark Connect RPC, which cancels everything running in the session and removes the session server side. Refactor code around managing the cache of sessions into `SparkConnectSessionManager`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBetter session management.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNot really. `SparkSession.stop()` API already existed on the client side. It was closing the client's network connection, but the Session was still there cached for 1 hour on the server side.\r\n\r\nCaveats, which were not really supported user behaviour:\r\n* After `session.stop()`, user could have created a new session with the same session_id in Configuration. That session would be a new session on the client side, but connect to the old cached session in the server. It could therefore e.g. access that old session's state like views or artifacts.\r\n* If a session timed out and was removed in the server, it used to be that a new request would re-create the session. The client would then see this as the old session, but the server would see a new one, and e.g. not have access to old session state that was removed.\r\n* User is no longer allowed to create a new session with the same session_id as before.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to wrap `BufferReleasingInputStream.available/reset` under `tryOrFetchFailedException`. So `IOException` during `available`/`reset` call will be rethrown as `FetchFailedException`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe have encountered shuffle data corruption issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: FAILED_TO_UNCOMPRESS(5)\r\nat org.xerial.snappy.SnappyNative.throw_error(SnappyNative.java:112)\r\nat org.xerial.snappy.SnappyNative.rawUncompress(Native Method)\r\nat org.xerial.snappy.Snappy.rawUncompress(Snappy.java:504)\r\nat org.xerial.snappy.Snappy.uncompress(Snappy.java:543)\r\nat org.xerial.snappy.SnappyInputStream.hasNextChunk(SnappyInputStream.java:450)\r\nat org.xerial.snappy.SnappyInputStream.available(SnappyInputStream.java:497)\r\nat org.apache.spark.storage.BufferReleasingInputStream.available(ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.scala:1356)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark shuffle has capacity to detect corruption for a few stream op like `read` and `skip`, such `IOException` in the stack trace will be rethrown as `FetchFailedException` that will re-try the failed shuffle task. But in the stack trace it is `available` that is not covered by the mechanism. So no-retry has been happened and the Spark application just failed.\r\n\r\nAs the `available`/`reset` op will also involve data decompression and throw `IOException`, we should be able to check it like `read` and `skip` do.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Data corruption during `available`/`reset` op is now causing `FetchFailedException` like `read` and `skip` that can be retried instead of `IOException`. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis integrates SSL support into TransportContext and related modules so that the RPC SSL functionality can work when properly configured.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is needed in order to support SSL for RPC connections.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI\r\n\r\nRan the following tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -P yarn\r\n> project network-common\r\n> testOnly\r\n> project network-shuffle\r\n> testOnly\r\n> project core\r\n> testOnly *Ssl*\r\n> project yarn\r\n> testOnly org.apache.spark.network.yarn.SslYarnShuffleServiceWithRocksDBBackendSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\nI verified traffic was encrypted using TLS using two mechanisms:\r\n\r\n* Enabled trace level logging for Netty and JDK SSL and saw logs confirming TLS handshakes were happening\r\n* I ran wireshark on my machine and snooped on traffic while sending queries shuffling a fixed string. Without any encryption, I could find that string in the network traffic. With this encryption enabled, that string did not show up, and wireshark logs confirmed a TLS handshake was happening.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

is a cherry-pick of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43531 to branch-3.5, with a few modifications.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHandle the case when input partitions become empty after V2 dynamic filtering, when SPJ is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrent in the situation when all input partitions are filtered out via dynamic filtering, SPJ doesn't work but instead will panic:\r\n```\r\njava.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get\r\n\tat scala.None$.get(Option.scala:529)\r\n\tat scala.None$.get(Option.scala:527)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.filteredPartitions$lzycompute(BatchScanExec.scala:108)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.filteredPartitions(BatchScanExec.scala:65)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.inputRDD$lzycompute(BatchScanExec.scala:136)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.inputRDD(BatchScanExec.scala:135)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the `groupPartitions` method will return `None` in this scenario. We should handle the case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a test case for this.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHandle the case when input partitions become empty after V2 dynamic filtering, when SPJ is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrent in the situation when all input partitions are filtered out via dynamic filtering, SPJ doesn't work but instead will panic:\r\n```\r\njava.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get\r\n\tat scala.None$.get(Option.scala:529)\r\n\tat scala.None$.get(Option.scala:527)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.filteredPartitions$lzycompute(BatchScanExec.scala:108)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.filteredPartitions(BatchScanExec.scala:65)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.inputRDD$lzycompute(BatchScanExec.scala:136)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.inputRDD(BatchScanExec.scala:135)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the `groupPartitions` method will return `None` in this scenario. We should handle the case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a test case for this.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to improve error message for JVM-dependent attributes on Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve the usability of error message by using proper error class.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API change, but only user-facing error messages are improved as below:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.sparkContext\r\nPySparkNotImplementedError: [NOT_IMPLEMENTED] sparkContext() is not implemented.\r\n```\r\n**After**\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.sparkContext\r\nPySparkAttributeError: [JVM_ATTRIBUTE_NOT_SUPPORTED] Attribute `sparkContext` is not supported in Spark Connect as it depends on the JVM. If you need to use this attribute, do not use Spark Connect when creating your session.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should pass\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-26T06:13:05Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T01:36:13Z","closed_at":"2023-10-29T10:27:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9494b07abfa1c51f11751e0f2479eb5dc81b3756","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43537/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43537/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43537/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f916de0cb2e5acd2bc35afa871c4eafbf09a5654","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-45674","ref":"SPARK-45674","sha":"f916de0cb2e5acd2bc35afa871c4eafbf09a5654","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, truncate raw bytes (udf/udtf/local relation) with `MAX_BYTES_SIZE`;\r\n2, pass `maxStringSize` to abbreviate nested messages;\r\n3, minor optimization to avoid temp array creation;\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, there is only one place specifying the `maxStringSize`, with value `MAX_STATEMENT_TEXT_SIZE = 65535`. By its name, it is used to truncate the SQL statements which are always strings. No need to affect raw bytes;\r\n\r\n2, according to the implementation of `Message.toString`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/java/core/src/main/java/com/google/protobuf/TextFormat.java#L567-L574\r\n\r\nthe value of bytes fields can be either `ByteString` or `byte[]`, so the two branches should be consistent.\r\n\r\n3, `maxStringSize` only affects the top-level string fields, it should also be used in nested messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nci\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nno\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-26T04:02:58Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T23:43:18Z","closed_at":"2023-10-26T14:11:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b22a83266ad26bd958c7a5b553bac3929f8d6d03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43535/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43535/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43535/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c4991c2231fd20a6b42d2f43e5589cd0eee1567e","head":{"label":"zhengruifeng:connect_abbreviate_fix","ref":"connect_abbreviate_fix","sha":"c4991c2231fd20a6b42d2f43e5589cd0eee1567e","user":{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51584791,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTU4NDc5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhengruifeng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng/spark","description":"Mirror

When the assertion fails, it's difficult to find the event log file that is having problems.\r\n\r\nIn this ticket, we will update the following two places to make the assert message clearer.\r\n\r\n- val files. Add `rootPath` field in the assert message.\r\n- val eventLogFiles.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHandle the case when input partitions become empty after V2 dynamic filtering, when SPJ is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrent in the situation when all input partitions are filtered out via dynamic filtering, SPJ doesn't work but instead will panic:\r\n```\r\njava.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get\r\n\tat scala.None$.get(Option.scala:529)\r\n\tat scala.None$.get(Option.scala:527)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.filteredPartitions$lzycompute(BatchScanExec.scala:108)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.filteredPartitions(BatchScanExec.scala:65)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.inputRDD$lzycompute(BatchScanExec.scala:136)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.v2.BatchScanExec.inputRDD(BatchScanExec.scala:135)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the `groupPartitions` method will return `None` in this scenario. We should handle the case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a test case for this.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr clean up the compilation warnings related to `it will become a keyword in Scala 3`,  additionally, to facilitate future Scala version migration, a new compiler option has been added to prohibit the use of these keywords as variable names.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are some literals, such as `enum`, `given`, `export`, etc., using them as variable names in Scala 2.13 will trigger compilation warnings, but this will become a compilation error in Scala 3.\r\n\r\n**Scala 2.13**\r\n\r\n```\r\nWelcome to Scala

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark supported all the orc compression codecs, but the orc supported compression codecs and spark supported are not completely one-on-one due to Spark introduce two compression codecs `NONE` and `UNCOMPRESSED`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a lot of magic strings copy from orc compression codecs. This issue lead to developers need to manually maintain its consistency. It is easy to make mistakes and reduce development efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLet developers easy to use orc compression codecs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe ComputeCurrentTime optimizer rule does produce unique timestamp Literals for current time expressions of a query. For CurrentDate and LocalTimestamp the Literal objects are not re-used though, but semantically equal objects are created for each instance. This can cost unnecessary much memory in case there are many such Literal objects.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a map that caches timestamp literals in case they are used more than once.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nA query that has a lot of equal literals could use unnecessary high amounts of memory\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new Unit Test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes observation when named observations with the same name on different datasets.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently if there are observations with the same name on different dataset, one of them will be overwritten by the other execution.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> observation1 = Observation(\"named\")\r\n>>> df1 = spark.range(50)\r\n>>> observed_df1 = df1.observe(observation1, count(lit(1)).alias(\"cnt\"))\r\n>>>\r\n>>> observation2 = Observation(\"named\")\r\n>>> df2 = spark.range(100)\r\n>>> observed_df2 = df2.observe(observation2, count(lit(1)).alias(\"cnt\"))\r\n>>>\r\n>>> observed_df1.collect()\r\n...\r\n>>> observed_df2.collect()\r\n...\r\n>>> observation1.get\r\n{'cnt': 50}\r\n>>> observation2.get\r\n{'cnt': 50}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`observation2` should return `{'cnt': 100}`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the observations with the same name will be available if they observe different datasets.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-25T00:29:03Z","updated_at":"2023-12-22T18:41:29Z","closed_at":"2023-10-25T07:59:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a99c3eb56d25a773a41fc77790fc7329583ac761","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43519/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43519/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43519/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ed3a9363baf98d8938a55f4878f58a76e4b50585","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-45656/observation","ref":"issues/SPARK-45656/observation","sha":"ed3a9363baf98d8938a55f4878f58a76e4b50585","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR allows non-deterministic expressions wrapped inside an `AggregateFunction` such as `count` inside `CollectMetrics` node. `CollectMetrics` is used to collect arbitrary metrics from the query, in certain scenarios user would like to collect metrics for filtering based on non-deterministic expressions (see query example below). \r\n\r\nCurrently, Analyzer does not allow non-deterministic expressions inside a `AggregateFunction` for `CollectMetrics`. This constraint is relaxed to allow collection of such metrics. Note that the metrics are relevant for a completed batch, and can change if the batch is replayed (because non-deterministic expression can behave differently for different runs). \r\n\r\nWhile working on this feature, I found a issue with `checkMetric` logic to validate non-deterministic expressions inside an AggregateExpression. An expression is determined as non-deterministic if any of its children is non-deterministic, hence we need to match the case for `!e.deterministic && !seenAggregate` after we have matched if the current expression is a AggregateExpression. If the current expression is a AggregateExpression, we should validate further down in the tree recursively - otherwise we will fail for any non-deterministic expression. \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nval inputData = MemoryStream[Timestamp]\r\n\r\ninputData.toDF()\r\n      .filter(\"value < current_date()\")\r\n      .observe(\"metrics\", count(expr(\"value >= current_date()\")).alias(\"dropped\"))\r\n      .writeStream\r\n      .queryName(\"ts_metrics_test\")\r\n      .format(\"memory\")\r\n      .outputMode(\"append\")\r\n      .start()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Added a testcase to calculate dropped rows (by `CurrentBatchTimestamp`) and ensure the query is successful. \r\n \r\nAs an example, the query below fails (without this change) due to observe call on the DataFrame.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nval inputData = MemoryStream[Timestamp]\r\n\r\ninputData.toDF()\r\n      .filter(\"value < current_date()\")\r\n      .observe(\"metrics\", count(expr(\"value >= current_date()\")).alias(\"dropped\"))\r\n      .writeStream\r\n      .queryName(\"ts_metrics_test\")\r\n      .format(\"memory\")\r\n      .outputMode(\"append\")\r\n      .start()\r\n\r\n```\r\n2. Added testing in AnalysisSuite for non-deterministic expressions inside a AggregateFunction.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis logs memory consumption while publishing snapshots. This is to investigate whether the suspected high memory usage is the root cause of `publish_snapshots` failures for master.\r\n\r\nMerging this after #43512 allows to run this manually.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe working assumption is that high memory usage is the root cause. This logging should provide proof or disproof for this assumption. This can be reverted once more is known or SPARK-45651 is fixed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nLocally\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-10-24T16:36:38Z","updated_at":"2023-10-27T00:47:09Z","closed_at":"2023-10-26T01:39:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f37b8f1cb621d1d1beec80df63f6b9a04af9fcdf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43513/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43513/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43513/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/176fa82930011b0d550af954b162167b613259d2","head":{"label":"G-Research:publish-snapshot-log-memory","ref":"publish-snapshot-log-memory","sha":"176fa82930011b0d550af954b162167b613259d2","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWith a manual trigger, the workflow can be executed manually after merging a fix of the workflow to master. This also allows to run the workflow only on a subset of branches (e.g. those that failed).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSometime, publishing snapshots fails. If a fix of the workflow file is needed, that change can only be tested by waiting for the next day when the cron even triggers the next publish. This is quite a long turnaround to test fixes to that workflow (see #43364).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, this is purely build CI related.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis can only be tested in master. Github workflow syntax tested in a private repo.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-10-24T16:14:55Z","updated_at":"2023-10-25T07:12:18Z","closed_at":"2023-10-24T23:58:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f43496ff61104794080d067284a43528e6ebe463","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43512/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43512/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43512/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/34541b34a6ada55886b7593cfb12d78fa09841c6","head":{"label":"G-Research:publish-snapshot-manually","ref":"publish-snapshot-manually","sha":"34541b34a6ada55886b7593cfb12d78fa09841c6","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs the GA of AWS SDK v2, the SDKv1 has entered maintenance mode where its future \r\nrelease are only limited to address critical bug and security issues. More details \r\nabout the SDK maintenance policy can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/maint-policy.html. \r\nTo keep Spark’s dependent softwares up to date, we should consider upgrading the SDK to v2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo because this change only impacts the integration tests codes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43123 upgraded the version of Oracle used for testing. As the daily test will reuse `build_and_test.yml`, the branch-3.x will also use the new version. However, due to the lack of synchronized code changes, the `OracleIntegrationSuite` in the `Docker integration tests` cannot pass the test during the daily test of branch-3.x:\r\n\r\n- branch-3.3: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/6609791712/job/17950549755\r\n- branch-3.4: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/6611049884/job/17954225189\r\n- branch-3.5: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/6612344747/job/17958021656\r\n\r\nSo this PR adds the ORACLE_DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME environment variable to the daily test yml file for branch-3.x and uses the previous version of the Oracle Docker image that can pass the test successfully.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRestore the daily test for branch-3.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo,dev-only\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nMonitor the daily test results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-10-24T02:59:30Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T15:56:19Z","closed_at":"2023-10-26T03:22:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"187c23688fd5ed8b43adccedba4cb83fb3e605b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43496/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43496/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43496/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9487049082ad2c1ca6e7b158784f0024363c6d74","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:oracl-docker-image-name","ref":"oracl-docker-image-name","sha":"9487049082ad2c1ca6e7b158784f0024363c6d74","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis (PR) introduces the utilization of fractions instead of slots, which is similar to the CPU strategy, \r\nfor determining whether a worker offer can provide the necessary resources to tasks.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when an executor reports to the driver with [gpu, [\"1,\", \"2\"]], the driver constructs an executor data map. \r\nThe keys in the map represent the GPU addresses, and their default values are set to 1.0, indicating one whole GPU.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the available resource amounts for the executor are as follows: { \"1\" -> 1.0f, \"2\" -> 1.0f }.\r\n\r\nWhen offering resources to a task that requires 1 CPU and 0.08 GPU, the worker offer examines the available resource amounts. \r\nIt identifies that the capacity of GPU address \"1.0\" is greater than the task's GPU requirement (1.0 >= 0.08). \r\nTherefore, Spark assigns the GPU address \"1\" to this task. After the assignment, the available resource amounts \r\nfor this executor are updated to { \"1\" -> 0.92, \"2\" -> 1.0}, ensuring that the remaining resources can be allocated to other tasks.\r\n\r\nIn scenarios where other tasks, using different task resource profiles, request varying GPU amounts \r\nwhen dynamic allocation is disabled, Spark applies the same comparison approach. It compares the task's GPU requirement with \r\nthe available resource amounts to determine if the resources can be assigned to the task.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe existing resources offering including gpu, fpga is based on \"slots per address\", which is defined by the default resource profile.\r\nand it's a fixed number for all different resource profiles when dynamic allcation is disabled.\r\n\r\nConsider the below test case,\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\n  withTempDir { dir =>\r\n    val scriptPath = createTempScriptWithExpectedOutput(dir, \"gpuDiscoveryScript\",\r\n      \"\"\"{\"name\": \"gpu\",\"addresses\":[\"0\"]}\"\"\")\r\n\r\n    val conf = new SparkConf()\r\n      .setAppName(\"test\")\r\n      .setMaster(\"local-cluster[1, 12, 1024]\")\r\n      .set(\"spark.executor.cores\", \"12\")\r\n      \r\n    conf.set(\"spark.worker.resource.gpu.amount\", \"1\")\r\n    conf.set(\"spark.worker.resource.gpu.discoveryScript\", scriptPath)\r\n    conf.set(\"spark.executor.resource.gpu.amount\", \"1\")\r\n    conf.set(\"spark.task.resource.gpu.amount\", \"0.08\")\r\n    \r\n    sc = new SparkContext(conf)\r\n    val rdd = sc.range(0, 100, 1, 4)\r\n    var rdd1 = rdd.repartition(3)\r\n    val treqs = new TaskResourceRequests().cpus(1).resource(\"gpu\", 1.0)\r\n    val rp = new ResourceProfileBuilder().require(treqs).build\r\n    rdd1 = rdd1.withResources(rp)\r\n    assert(rdd1.collect().size === 100)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring the initial stages, Spark generates a default resource profile based on the configurations. The calculation \r\nfor determining the slots per GPU address is performed as \"spark.executor.resource.gpu.amount / spark.task.resource.gpu.amount\", \r\nresulting in a value of 12 (1/0.08 = 12). This means that Spark can accommodate up to 12 tasks running on each GPU address simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe job is then divided into two stages. The first stage, which consists of 4 tasks, runs concurrently based on \r\nthe default resource profile. However, the second stage, comprising 3 tasks, runs sequentially using a new task \r\nresource profile. This new profile specifies that each task requires 1 CPU and 1.0 full GPU.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the tasks in the second stage are running in parallel, which is the underlying issue.\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in the line `new TaskResourceRequests().cpus(1).resource(\"gpu\", 1.0)`. The value of 1.0 \r\nfor the GPU, or any value below 1.0 (specifically, (0, 0.5] which is rounded up to 1.0, spark throws an exception if the value is in (0.5, 1)), \r\nis merely requesting the number of slots. In this case, it is requesting only 1 slot. Consequently, each task \r\nnecessitates 1 CPU core and 1 GPU slot, resulting in all tasks running simultaneously.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCredit to @anishshri-db for the initial investigation and the fix.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove `@abstractmethod` annotation from `onQueryIdle` in PySpark StreamingQueryListener.\r\n\r\nThe function `onQueryIdle` was added with the annotation `@abstractmethod`, which does not pick up default implementation and enforces users to implement the new method. This breaks all existing streaming query listener implementations and enforces them to add the dummy function implementation at least.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-allows existing implementations to work properly without explicitly adding a new function `onQueryIdle`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe broke backward compatibility in [SPARK-43183](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43183) and we want to fix it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified tests. Now tests are verifying two different implementations covering old interface vs new interface.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-10-23T06:31:12Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T20:12:09Z","closed_at":"2023-10-23T12:12:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f9069bfa51939b8fed1ed353129207acb2a3c7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR mainly does two things:\r\n1. Clean up all compilation warnings related to \"Auto-application to () is deprecated\".\r\n2. Change the compilation options to convert this compilation warning into a compilation error.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, due to an issue with scalatest(https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/2297), there are some false positives. Therefore, this PR has added the corresponding rules to suppress them, and left the corresponding TODO(SPARK-45615). We can clean up these rules after scalatest fixes this issue(https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/pull/2298).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Clean up the deprecated usage methods.\r\n2. As this compilation warning will become a compilation error in Scala 3, to ensure it does not occur again, this PR also converts it into a compilation error in Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the following code:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nclass Foo {\r\n  def isEmpty(): Boolean = true\r\n}\r\nval foo = new Foo\r\nval ret = foo.isEmpty\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Scala 2.13:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWelcome to Scala 2.13.12 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 17.0.8).\r\nType in expressions for evaluation.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new feature(which is disabled by default to maintain current behavior) that would evaluate scalar subqueries in the Optimizer before rule to push down filter. \r\n\r\nNote that this PR is similar (in intent) to:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23802\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41088\r\nbut is not the same. This is because the above two PRs requires the FileSourceScan. This PR will still work if, for example, you are using BatchScan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSome queries can benefit from having it's scalar subquery in the filter evaluated while planning so that the scalar result (from the subquery) can be push down. \r\n\r\nFor example, a query like \r\n\r\n`select * from t2 where b > (select max(a) from t1) `\r\n\r\nwhere t1 is a small table but t2 is a very large table can benefit if we first evaluate the subquery then push down the result to the pushed filter (instead of having the subquery in the post scan filter)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. A new conf is added (which is disabled by default)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tested and manually tested\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-21T06:21:45Z","updated_at":"2024-06-14T00:32:51Z","closed_at":"2024-06-14T00:19:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80a3664c76cd1c7ef1ea20d488ade43fb549a3c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ba726883e24f4e307d2740be217fcbdb27159770","head":{"label":"maytasm:sub_q_push_down","ref":"sub_q_push_down","sha":"ba726883e24f4e307d2740be217fcbdb27159770","user":{"login":"maytasm","id":52679095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjc5MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52679095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm","html_url":"https://github.com/maytasm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":635189510,"node_id":"R_kgDOJdw5Bg","name":"spark","full_name":"maytasm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maytasm","id":52679095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjc5MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52679095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm","html_url":"https://github.com/maytasm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maytasm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maytasm/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nApply the observed metrics to `Observation` object.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen using `Observation`, the observed metrics should be applied to the object.\r\n\r\nFor example, in vanilla PySpark:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([[\"Alice\", 2], [\"Bob\", 5]], [\"name\", \"age\"])\r\n>>> observation = Observation(\"my metrics\")\r\n>>> observed_df = df.observe(observation, count(lit(1)).alias(\"count\"), max(col(\"age\")))\r\n>>> observed_df.count()\r\n2\r\n>>>\r\n>>> observation.get\r\n{'count': 2, 'max(age)': 5}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas in Spark Connect, currently it fails with `PySparkNotImplementedError`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> observation.get\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\n    raise PySparkNotImplementedError(\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkNotImplementedError: [NOT_IMPLEMENTED] Observation support for Spark Connect is not implemented.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the `Observation` will see the changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded/modified the related tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`CastSuiteBase` and `ExpressionInfoSuite` use `ParVector.foreach()` to run Spark SQL queries in parallel. They incorrectly assume that each parallel operation will inherit the main thread’s active SparkSession. This is only true when these parallel operations run in freshly-created threads. However, when other code has already run some parallel operations before Spark was started, then there may be existing threads that do not have an active SparkSession. In that case, these tests fail with NullPointerExceptions when creating SparkPlans or running SQL queries.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to use the existing method `ThreadUtils.parmap()`. This method creates fresh threads that inherit the current active SparkSession, and it propagates the Spark ThreadLocals.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a scalastyle warning against use of ParVector.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change makes `CastSuiteBase` and `ExpressionInfoSuite` less brittle to future changes that may run parallel operations during test startup.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nReproduced the test failures by running a ParVector operation before Spark starts. Verified that this PR fixes the test failures in this condition.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  protected override def beforeAll(): Unit = {\r\n    // Run a ParVector operation before initializing the SparkSession. This starts some Scala\r\n    // execution context threads that have no active SparkSession. These threads will be reused for\r\n    // later ParVector operations, reproducing SPARK-45616.\r\n    new ParVector((0 until 100).toVector).foreach { _ => }\r\n\r\n    super.beforeAll()\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn current version `DataSource#checkAndGlobPathIfNecessary` qualifies paths via `Path#makeQualified` and `PartitioningAwareFileIndex` qualifies via `FileSystem#makeQualified`. Most `FileSystem` implementations simply delegate to `Path#makeQualified`, but others, like `HarFileSystem` contain fs-specific logic, that can produce different result. Such inconsistencies can lead to a situation, when spark can't find partitions of the source file, because qualified paths, built by `Path` and `FileSystem` are different. Therefore, for uniformity, the `FileSystem` path qualification should be used in `DataSource#checkAndGlobPathIfNecessary`.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAllow users to read files from hadoop archives (.har) using DataFrameReader API\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew tests were added in `DataSourceSuite` and `DataFrameReaderWriterSuite`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark streaming uses Scala.Try to catch NonFatal exception during generating streaming jobs in `JobGenerator.generateJobs`. But if any fatal error (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`) happens, it won't be caught. Normally just error should propagate up and finally crash Spark runtime, but Spark streaming does this in separate thread.\r\n\r\nIf the fatal error crashes entire JVM, it also can bring Spark down. But for some customer cases, the OOM is thrown by `ByteArrayOutputStream` when it cannot grow up to new capacity (new capacity is overflow on Int range, see Java [source code](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk11/blob/master/src/java.base/share/classes/java/io/ByteArrayOutputStream.java#L123)). So it is not actually running memory in JVM and JVM won't be down by that. Eventually the OOM is ignored by Spark streaming and next batches are continuing to execute. Such behavior causes unnoticed data loss for the streaming application. We should propagate all failures including fatal ones.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to add Matomo analytics to pyspark  docs pages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter [SPARK-45286](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45286), We have added `Matomo analytics` functionality to `non pyspark documents`, and now we need to add the same logic to `pyspark
