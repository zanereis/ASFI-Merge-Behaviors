PR adds two utilities to simplify the training process: Trainer and SetupTrainer.\r\n\r\nSetupTrainer is basically a pass, transforming a backbone module to a complete, legalized trainer module. It is a combination of Gradient pass, loss function, optimizer, AppendLoss pass, LegalizeOps, etc. You can store the trainer module into a file and load it to somewhere else.\r\n\r\nTrainer is a runtime utility that accepts the IRModule (that is the result of SetupTrainer) and the relax VM (that contains the built result of the IRModule), and helps run the VM. It maintains the parameters, the model states and the optimizer states internally.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Chaofan Lin

PR fixes an issue in MetaScheduleApplyDatabase, which uses the IRModule being queried as the base module of TIR Schedule. This will cause the inconsistency between the IRModule being scheduled and the trace of the record. For example, the trace of the record may have `get-block` instructions which tries to get block from a given name, which exists in the IRModule of the record while does not exist in the IRModule being queried (which is right the IRModule being scheduled).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR adds a case discussion. When anchor-op equality is not applied, we create the TIR schedule from the IRModule of the record, so that we can prevent the issue above from happening.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a unit test that can demonstrate the issue.","created_at":"2023-04-22T15:29:05Z","updated_at":"2023-04-23T04:43:56Z","closed_at":"2023-04-23T04:43:55Z","merged_at":"2023-04-23T04:43:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"19e82ecb3a539a42a4726394720e46a4cd3532e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

PR changes a behavior of the legalization of matmul, so that we do not use 0 as indices in the generated TIR in certain case.\r\n\r\nSince the matmul op supports broadcasting and batching, previously when legalizing a matmul op, for the broadcasting dimensions, we will emit indices \"0\" for those broadcasting dimensions with length 1. For example, the code below is a TIR produced by matmul legalization.\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef matmul(A: T.Buffer((T.int64(1), T.int64(1), T.int64(4), T.int64(5)), \"float32\"), B: T.Buffer((T.int64(1), T.int64(1), T.int64(5), T.int64(7)), \"float32\"), matmul_1: T.Buffer((T.int64(1), T.int64(1), T.int64(4), T.int64(7)), \"float32\")):\r\n    T.func_attr({\"tir.noalias\": T.bool(True)})\r\n    # with T.block(\"root\"):\r\n    for i0, i1, i2, i3, k in T.grid(T.int64(1), T.int64(1), T.int64(4), T.int64(7), T.int64(5)):\r\n        with T.block(\"matmul\"):\r\n            v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3, v_k = T.axis.remap(\"SSSSR\", [i0, i1, i2, i3, k])\r\n            T.reads(A[T.int64(0), T.int64(0), v_i2, v_k], B[T.int64(0), T.int64(0), v_k, v_i3])\r\n            T.writes(matmul_1[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3])\r\n            with T.init():\r\n                matmul_1[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3] = T.float32(0)\r\n            matmul_1[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3] = matmul_1[v_i0, v_i1, v_i2, v_i3] + A[T.int64(0), T.int64(0), v_i2, v_k] * B[T.int64(0), T.int64(0), v_k, v_i3]\r\n```\r\nYou can see us using `T.int64(0)` to index the first dim of `A` and `B`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when both `A` and `B` have length 1 at that dimension, it is more canonical to use a variable as the index, as this is more acceptable and detectable by analysis functions generally.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR updates the behavior, so that we will emit variable as indices when both sides have length 1, just as the example above. We have a unit test to demonstrate the effect after changing.","created_at":"2023-04-22T15:02:08Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T17:42:38Z","closed_at":"2023-04-22T17:42:38Z","merged_at":"2023-04-22T17:42:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"ee6e26f2cb1159ab6a5cfc74b96b37b464b19797","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

Changes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IMPORTANT: This release fixes a security vulnerability in the\nparser where a regular expression vulnerable to ReDOS (Regular\nExpression Denial of Service) was used. See the security advisory\nfor details: <a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/security/advisories/GHSA-rrm6-wvj7-cwh2\">https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/security/advisories/GHSA-rrm6-wvj7-cwh2</a>\nThe vulnerability was discovered by <a href=\"https://github.com/erik-krogh\"><code>@​erik-krogh</code></a> from GitHub\nSecurity Lab (GHSL). Thanks for reporting!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bug Fixes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revert a change from 0.4.0 that changed IN to be a comparison (issue694).\nThe primary expectation is that IN is treated as a keyword and not as a\ncomparison operator. That also follows the definition of reserved keywords\nfor the major SQL syntax definitions.</li>\n<li>Fix regular expressions for string parsing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sqlparse now uses pyproject.toml instead of setup.cfg (issue685).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/647d1457acf7d88614215841eb15d423df2a1895\"><code>647d145</code></a> Update Changelog.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/58dae6fcd2a51209aeccd4fff3b923bf37714e19\"><code>58dae6f</code></a> Bump version.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/d9d69f47ed13a583c81473211f44ae320470a58b\"><code>d9d69f4</code></a> Removed test file</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/64bb91f4880b46f73b4cc9207ae9ccc180d56d1b\"><code>64bb91f</code></a> Testing branch</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/c457abd5f097dd13fb21543381e7cfafe7d31cfb\"><code>c457abd</code></a> Remove unnecessary parts in regex for bad escaping.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/b949fdf9a1538f98b57612bef6306fc38f32aaf7\"><code>b949fdf</code></a> CI: Use codecov action.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/fc76056fb8f0ec713a3f2a2b6206a3336932c382\"><code>fc76056</code></a> Cleanup regex for detecting keywords (fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/issues/709\">#709</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/7fdb2da82d51a9a02baaefb5c7fe5cbbaac4329e\"><code>7fdb2da</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/issues/633\">#633</a> from shikanime/master</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/dd9d5b91d7aa30e4a000d5370f09dc99378891dc\"><code>dd9d5b9</code></a> Fix get_type with comments between WITH keyword</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/commit/907fb496f90f2719095a1f01fe24db1e5c0e15a8\"><code>907fb49</code></a> change singleton behavior</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/andialbrecht/sqlparse/compare/0.4.3...0.4.4\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sqlparse&package-manager=pip&previous-version=0.4.3&new-version=0.4.4)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

track the state of transformation during joint-optimization, current TuningAPI manages two copies of IRModule in `Trace`. \r\nHowever, it becomes a problem for large models because we need to copy their parameters as well. \r\n\r\nAs we only have a single tuning pass for MetaSchedule now, this PR temporarily disables the usage of `Trace` to unblock the tuning of large models. Upcoming PR will refactor this. \r\n\r\ncc. @masahi

PR adds the Droplet Search algorithm to AutoTVM. Droplet search\r\nis a variation of the Coordinate Descent Algorithm. It relies on the\r\nempirical observation that the search space formed by typical kernels\r\ncontains, within the same convex region, origin (the kernel without\r\noptimizations) and the best kernel configuration.\r\n\r\nDroplet search is deployed in the same setting as any other search\r\nalgorithm that is implemented in AutoTVM. Droplet search is expected\r\nto run faster than gridSearch, randomSearch, GA, and XGBoost. It tends\r\nto find kernels that are as good as those found by these other\r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\nA detailed account of the algorithm can be found in this paper:\r\n\r\nhttps://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/publications/papers/DropletSearch.pdf","created_at":"2023-04-20T17:14:12Z","updated_at":"2023-04-28T13:30:36Z","closed_at":"2023-04-28T13:30:01Z","merged_at":"2023-04-28T13:30:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"c254b757056c516c03a64d8cc9c0c55769719d4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14683/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14683/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14683/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/fb8f6971333818b625b1054165b09b095476564f","head":{"label":"canesche:main","ref":"main","sha":"fb8f6971333818b625b1054165b09b095476564f","user":{"login":"canesche","id":11246081,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjQ2MDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11246081?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/canesche","html_url":"https://github.com/canesche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canesche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canesche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canesche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canesche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canesche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canesche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canesche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canesche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canesche/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"1a70083711d0f3a315485e9618b0553c31bec864","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

in AMP, the decision to insert a cast to fp32 is overly conservative. In particular, if the bias is fp32, the fp16 activation is cast back to fp32 instead of keeping it to fp16 and casting bias to fp16. So it results in a lot of patterns like below. \r\n\r\n```\r\nlv16: R.Tensor((2, 1280), dtype=\"float16\") = R.matmul(lv1_1, lv2_1, out_dtype=\"float16\")\r\nlv3_1: R.Tensor((2, 1280), dtype=\"float32\") = R.astype(lv16, dtype=\"float32\")\r\nlv17: R.Tensor((2, 1280), dtype=\"float32\") = R.add(lv3_1, unet_time_embedding_linear_1_bias)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR reduces the number of unnecessary cast to fp32 by checking the range of a constant argument. If it fits within fp16, there is no need to cast it to fp32, and if all args are fp16 or castable to fp16, we can keep activations to fp16.\r\n\r\nAlso added AMP support for the attention op.\r\n\r\n@spectrometerHBH

found that if I use `BindParams` early in my BYOC workflow, some Relax passes become extremely slow. For example, `partition_for_cutlass` takes more than 40 sec on SD UNet if parameters are bound, while otherwise it only takes 1 sec.\r\n\r\nThis massive regression is due to the `unordered_map` used by `BlockBuilder`, https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/unity/src/relax/ir/block_builder.cc#L381-L382\r\n\r\nThis map is keyed on `BaseFunc` and it uses structural equal / hash. So if large parameters are bound on each func, those params are hashed / compared repeatedly. \r\n\r\nThis is solved by introducing a custom struct hash that ignores NDArray content.\r\n\r\n@tqchen

PR improves webgpu codegen to handle large launch grid.\r\n\r\nBackground: webgpu do not allow grid size bigger than 65535 so we have to factorize the gridDim.x when it is too big and spread it across gridDim.x and gridDim.z.\r\n\r\nThis approach however is not always possible.

`DataflowReshapeRewrite` expects that `call_tir(reshape, (...))` gets only one input: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/unity/src/relax/transform/rewrite_dataflow_reshape.cc#L66-L67\r\n\r\nThis makes sense, but I met a case where this assumption doesn't hold. Consider the following subgraph:\r\n\r\n```\r\n             split\r\n         /     |     \\\r\n        /      |      \\\r\n       /       |       \\\r\n      /        |        \\\r\n tuple get  tuple get  tuple get\r\n     |         |         |\r\n     |         |         |\r\n reshape    reshape    reshape\r\n      \\        |         /\r\n       \\       |        /\r\n        \\      |       /\r\n         \\     |      /\r\n           attention\r\n```       \r\n\r\nSince `split` and `attention` cannot be fused, each branch of `tuple get -> reshape` becomes a fused function whose input is a tuple. In `FuseTIR`, this tuple input is flattened, so the fused tir `reshape` function gets three buffers as input, even though only one of them is actually reshaped. This is what it looks like after `FuseTIR`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlv47_3 = R.call_tir(cls.split1, (lv46_2,), out_sinfo=[R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\"), R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\"), R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\")])\r\n\r\nlv1579: R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\") = lv47_3[0]\r\nlv1580: R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\") = lv47_3[1]\r\nlv1581_1: R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\") = lv47_3[2]\r\nlv729_1 = R.call_tir(cls.fused_reshape5_cast17, (lv1579, lv1580, lv1581_1), out_sinfo=R.Tensor((2, 4096, 8, 40), dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n\r\nlv1582: R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\") = lv47_3[0]\r\nlv1583: R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\") = lv47_3[1]\r\nlv1584: R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\") = lv47_3[2]\r\nlv730_1 = R.call_tir(cls.fused_reshape5_cast171, (lv1582, lv1583, lv1584), out_sinfo=R.Tensor((2, 4096, 8, 40), dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n\r\nlv1585: R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\") = lv47_3[0]\r\nlv1586: R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\") = lv47_3[1]\r\nlv1587: R.Tensor((2, 4096, 320), dtype=\"float16\") = lv47_3[2]\r\nlv731_1 = R.call_tir(cls.fused_reshape5_cast172, (lv1585, lv1586, lv1587), out_sinfo=R.Tensor((2, 4096, 8, 40), dtype=\"float32\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n`DataflowReshapeRewrite` breaks on such mod, since `reshape` function is getting three inputs. \r\n\r\nNow, the TIR mod above looks odd but it is functionally correct. I wanted to change `FuseTIR` to emit only used buffers when flattening the tuple, but that seems complicated. Modifying `DataflowReshapeRewrite` to accept such mod is a bit hacky but a simple solution. \r\n\r\n\r\n@MasterJH5574 @Hzfengsy

PR adds two components to support the Relax training workflow: loss function library and AppendLoss pass.\r\n- Loss function library. A library that generates relax functions representing common loss functions, such as MSELoss and CrossEntropyLoss. \r\n  - Generally, loss function will take one or more **input parameters** (that is outputs of the backbone of a model), one or more **target parameters**, and generate a scalar value denoting the loss.\r\n- AppendLoss pass. You can specify one function (the backbone function) in the IRModule, and one loss function (normally, generated by the loss function library) to AppendLoss. It will attach the loss function to the backbone function, and add the result function to the IRModule.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Chaofan Lin

sending this PR to solicit feedback on this approach and am open to revisions or upstreaming parts of it into the `main` branch if needed.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it possible for Relax pipelines to keep track of which original Relax operators were fused into which PackedFunc. To accomplish this, it introduces a new IR node: MultiSpan, which contains an Array<Span>. , it subclasses Span. Therefore, in a MultiSpan instance, the `Span` fields should be ignored. A more proper way to do this would be to rename Span to e.g. SingleSpan, but this would create so many conflicts that it would need to happen upstream first.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, this is only implemented in the FuseOps Relax pass. There will be limitations of this approach--for example, a `VarNode` referenced from multiple places in an IRModule will not be able to have distinct Spans. My interest here lies *only* in tracking this information in Relax functions where fusion and other \"graph-level\" transforms will occur, so I'm not sure I can justify doing something more elaborate such as introducing a new ObjectPath-based IR tracking facility. However, my hope is that the benefits are spelled out enough here to motivate a somewhat inferior approach as a starting point, and we can learn from this and improve as needed.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\n@junrushao @yelite @tqchen @masahi @jwfromm

PR introduces several utils to support training models in Relax IR, including:\r\n- Loss functions. A library that generates relax functions representing common loss functions, such as MSELoss and CrossEntropyLoss.\r\n- AppendLoss pass. You can specify one function (the backbone function) in the IRModule, and one loss function to AppendLoss. It will attach the loss function to the backbone function, and add the result function to the IRModule.\r\n- Optimizers. A library that generates relax functions representing common optimizers, such as SGD and Adam.\r\n- SetupTrainer. A pass that transform the backbone module (a IRModule containing only one function named \"backbone\") into a module that contains all functions used in the training process.\r\n- Trainer. A runtime utility that stores parameters, states, etc, and helps to run the training IRModule.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Chaofan Lin

PR adds a behavior to the MetaSchedule post-processor RewriteParallelVectorizeUnroll, so that it does not annotate spatial blocks with the unroll annotation.\r\n\r\nThis is because the optimization for spatial blocks (standalone in a GPU kernel, for example) can be done by purely thread binding. As a result, annotating loop unrolling for spatial blocks does not help. In some case where the unroll factor is very large (e.g., 512 or 1024), unrolling the spatial blocks will consume much time during the kernel compilation and introduces unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we turn off the behavior of unrolling spatial blocks.","created_at":"2023-04-17T01:00:13Z","updated_at":"2023-04-17T16:01:56Z","closed_at":"2023-04-17T16:01:55Z","merged_at":"2023-04-17T16:01:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"87146565b4b4b70a1d85f1c4e293de56d265e377","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14642/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14642/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14642/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/138db06c579986a07cb75e99834cd2e112e7c83a","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-04-16-ms-not-unroll-spatial-blocks","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-04-16-ms-not-unroll-spatial-blocks","sha":"138db06c579986a07cb75e99834cd2e112e7c83a","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

later.","created_at":"2023-04-16T20:42:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-17T16:01:26Z","closed_at":"2023-04-17T13:34:00Z","merged_at":"2023-04-17T13:34:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9d9172cf936f8490bb543dee8f013133704baba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14641/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14641/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14641/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/02f81e111924082653a16f07c2b1df05bad0787a","head":{"label":"tqchen:vulkan","ref":"vulkan","sha":"02f81e111924082653a16f07c2b1df05bad0787a","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen

PR introduces the `enable_warning` argument for the LegalizeOps pass and the MetaScheduleApplyDatabase pass. These two passes now will emit warnings only when the `enable_warning` argument is true.\r\n\r\nWe introduce this because in our recent practice of [Web LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm), we leverage three passes to generate the GPU code for the TIR functions in a given IRModule. The passes are MetaScheduleDatabaseApply, DispatchTIROperator (one pass that substitutes a TIR func with another handmade one or hand-scheduled one), and DefaultGPUSchedule, in order. (https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/blob/514f6e3132f91a2460f012a74861cd57b43560fb/build.py#L157-L161)\r\n\r\nIn this case (and most of the cases), we always have the DefaultGPUSchedule pass as a safe guard, and it is common and often that one TIR function does not exist in the MetaSchedule database. For this reason, always printing warning is not ideal and can be too much and annoying for both users and developers.\r\n\r\nThe same reason applies to LegalizeOps as well. In our practice of WebLLM, we bring in some high-level operator that is not intended to be legalized (of course, it does not have a legalization function). Always printing the warnings is also not expected as well.\r\n\r\nAccording to these experiences, we try to introduce a new argument for configuring the behavior of if emitting warnings or not.","created_at":"2023-04-16T01:16:38Z","updated_at":"2023-04-17T21:11:46Z","closed_at":"2023-04-17T21:11:46Z","merged_at":"2023-04-17T21:11:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"ff2f3c861a90016c0770f808e4f69ece41d2e1ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

PR changes the naming behavior of call_te. With this PR, all tensors created by call_te will be named in alphabetical order (`A`, `B`, `C`...). When the number of tensors exceeds 26, the trailing tensors will be named as `input26`, `input27` and so on so forth.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, call_te uses the default name \"rxplaceholder\" for every tensor. On one hand, this name is too long and doesn't look clean in the printed TVMScript. On the other hand, using this name for every tensor is problematic from the perspective of TIR and will lead to scheduling error. For example, previously, the following code snippet will print the TIR function where two cache-read blocks having the same name, which is not a legal TIR function.\r\n```python\r\nbb = relax.BlockBuilder()\r\nx = relax.Var(\"x\", R.Tensor((2, 3), \"float32\"))\r\ny = relax.Var(\"y\", R.Tensor((3, 4), \"float32\"))\r\nwith bb.function(\"main\", [x, y]):\r\n    gv =

on feedback for `DefaultGPUSchedule` pass, we noticed that while PrimFuncs can be supported without tuning on GPU devices, the performance is not competitive. Therefore we introduce a new FewShotTuning pass for static shape PrimFuncs that directly samples from the search space and make sure the returned candidate can pass post-processors.\r\n\r\nBy design, this pass enables most of the performance optimizations according to the target, and avoided tuning by:\r\n- Disable benchmarking by default.\r\n- Only do random sampling.\r\n- Limit valid trials to user specified small number, by default 1.\r\n- Skip tuning apis and directly do sampling and compilation.\r\n- Still guarantee result is compilable.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up for @psrivas2's work and based on discussion with @sunggg and @psrivas2.\r\n\r\nCC: @jwfromm @junrushao

PR fixes the problem that ops like `topi.full` cannot be correctly tuned.\r\n\r\nCurrently, metaSchedule system adopts a XGBoost model to predict the running performance of an IRModule based on features extracted from it. \r\n\r\nHowever, Some operators like `topi.full` has so simple IRModule that no feature can be extracted. `topi.full` contains only one BufferStore node with a FloatImm value, so `PerStoreFeature` extractor cannot find any feature from it. And the XGBModel also cannot handle cases when there is no features.\r\n\r\nThis PR specifically handles this case in `PerStoreFeatureNode` and `XGBModel`.\r\n\r\nThanks to @junrushao

PR fixes a behavior of the UnifyThreadBinding pass which (at one place) assumes a return value is always a ForNode, which is not right.\r\n\r\nTo be more specific, when a thread-binding loop has an annotation, the current behavior is assuming that the post-recursive-mutation value is also a ForNode, and apply the previous annotation directly to the new loop. However, the post-recursive-mutation value is also possibly not a ForNode. In this case, the current behavior is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a new unit-length loop in this case to preserve the annotation.\r\n\r\nThanks Bohan for catching this
