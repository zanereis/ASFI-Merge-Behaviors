PR makes the pgbouncer deployment size configurable via helm chart. The linked issue raises concerns about running multiple pgbouncers - I believe this to only be the case when running them on a the same physical (or vm, etc) machine, and not in a kubernetes deployment.\r\n\r\nI don't believe this will provide perfect HA - for that, anyone who raises this replica count should also be sure to enable the associated PDB to ensure some number of pgbouncer pods are always running. This also doesn't prevent breakages for anything with an active connection to pgbouncer - when one of these pods dies, those connections will be severed and will have to reconnect.\r\n\r\nCloses

[issue](https://github.com/aws-samples/emr-serverless-samples/issues/22) was found where Airflow would mark a task as SUCCESS even if the EMR job failed. \r\nThe solution here is to set the desired state in EmrServerlessStartJobOperator to SUCCESS_STATES rather than TERMINAL_STATES. This makes it so that the task is marked as a failure if the job doesn't run successfully.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

methods were implemented in \"view\" but they were used in other\r\nplaces (in dot_renderer) so they conceptually belong to common\r\nutil code.

The first time through `DagBag.__init__`, and the second time explicitly in a command code.  This is not needed and causes performance degradation.\r\n-  `safe_mode` has been overridden to `false` in the command code for no reason, which means more files are processed than needed.\r\n- Parameter `subdir` is not supported, which is inconsistent with the rest of the commands that create the DagBag instance. Whenever a DagBag is created by any other commands, it is possible to set the `dag_folder` using the `subdir` parameter including `airflow dag list`, `airflow scheduler`, and others.\r\n\r\nI had a problem with choosing a PR title that would look good in a changelog, because we have 3 very related problems here, but I think adding a new CLI parameter is the most user-facing, The rest of the problems would not be (probably) noticed by anyone without looking at the code.\r\n\r\nCC: @collinmcnulty, @potiuk, @uranusjr, @sfc-gh-mkmak \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nKamil Breguła\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^

PR implements a log tail feature on file_task_handler\r\n\r\nAs described in #15783 it would be a great feature to have log tail available in Airflow UI so that if you watch something running you don't need to hit the F5 key constantly to follow the running task.\r\n\r\nActually I saw the same demand and with this PR want to contribute this feature upstream.\r\n\r\nI wanted to implement this from scratch when I realized that an auto-tail is already implemented in the UI, just the back-end needs to feed data in a way that tail is active. So this PR is a minimal-invasive implementation on the `file_task_handler.py` alongside with small adjustments to inheriting provider implementation.\r\n\r\ncloses: #15783\r\nrelated: #15783\r\n\r\nHow to test:\r\n* Start a long running DAG based on an airflow instance from this branch and see that the running task instance which produces logs will add content to the view.\r\n\r\nExample DAG I used for testing, running 200 seconds and adding log lines every second:\r\n```\r\nimport pendulum\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id='a_log_running_dag',\r\n    schedule='0 * * * *',\r\n    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz=\"UTC\"),\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n) as dag:\r\n    BashOperator(\r\n        task_id='runme',\r\n        bash_command='for i in {1..200}; do echo $i; sleep 1; done',\r\n

conrib modules are carried from Airflow 1.10 and we cannot\r\nremove the classes that were used there without bumping Airlfow\r\nto 3, however we can replace the files with dynamic

This way we will have far less number\r\nof files in contrib and users will not get auto-import and\r\nautocomplete when they will be developing their DAGs.\r\n\r\nThis does not break compatibility but it providers much stronger\r\nsignal to the users that they should switch to new classes:\r\n\r\n* they will not see the classes in autocomplete and autoimport\r\n  any more\r\n* it will seem that the classes are not existing in contrib until\r\n  they are used\r\n* if anyone performs static analysis on the DAGs, the analysis\r\n  will fail (and this is an intended behaviour)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

quite some time we did not have the name of the main builds\r\nHowever more and more the \"main\" builds are used to provide early\r\nwarnigns for some problems:\r\n\r\n* 3rd-party dependencies breaking our builds\r\n* our own dependencies breaking the constraints\r\n* building ARM images\r\n* building breeze images quickly\r\n* running complete matrix of tests\r\n* finding flaky tests\r\n\r\nSo effectively, those main builds are really \"Canary\" builds - when\r\nthose builds are failing, they give us a chance to react quickly,\r\nwithout affecting the regular PR builds.\r\n\r\nThis PR clarifies the meaning and reasoning for those builds\r\nand introduces \"Canary\" name for them.\r\n\r\nDuring related documentation review, it also turned out that a number\r\nof old environment variables are not used any more (after the breeze\r\nchanging to Python) and this PR also removes them from documentation\r\nand removes the variables from all the scripts (including removal of\r\nsome unused scripts)\r\n\r\nThe new documentation also mentions somethign that we've learned\r\nrecently - that in case you use Breeze in non-airflow workflows in\r\nGitHub Actions, you need to override the variables through command\r\nline parameters rather than through environment variables, because\r\nGitHub actions treats GITHUB_* variables as immutable for security.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

is a follow-up after #26148 where we found out that basic\r\nbreeze command took far more time than it should when user\r\nanswered \"yes\" to rebuild the image.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `--max-time` parameter to `breze shell` command which\r\nforces \"exit\" to be executed as command and fails if the command\r\ndoes not complete in time specified.\r\n\r\nThis command is run in \"early build cache\" so failure there will\r\nnot fail the whole build (the job has \"continue on error\" set),\r\nbut we will see the \"red\" status of the `main` workflow in case\r\nthe build takes longer than 120 seconds - indicating that the\r\nbuild takes too long.\r\n\r\nWe only run it for `amd` images because if we have a problem\r\nthere, we will have similar problem in arm images.\r\n\r\nWe make sure to clear the docker cache before the command is run\r\nto make sure that it runs in \"clean\" state.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the zombie detection method comes from the scheduler job, in a distributed environment it can be cumbersome to find the worker that actually had the problem that led to the zombie.

far when we attempted to upgrade requirements of a dependency with\r\nfixed requirement or when the new range was not overlapping with the\r\nold rangem we had to synchronize pushing constraints at the same\r\ntime as merging the setup.py/setup.cfg change - otherwise regular\r\nPR that did not have \"--upgrade-to-newer-dependencies\" derived,\r\nfailed because of conflicting constraints.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves the problem by attempting to rebuild the image again,\r\nthis time with \"--upgrade-to-newer-dependencies\" set when the\r\nfirst attempt to build fail in CI.\r\n\r\nThe effect of it should be that the image should not fail and let the\r\nregular PRs continue, while the constraints are being updated in\r\nmain.\r\n\r\nThis should finally make the builds self-maintainable even if we\r\nbump fixed constraints.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

with AIP-38, we were going to build a brand new react UI in as a beta and eventually switch over to it. That lived over in `airflow/ui`. But in order to support new features in 2.3 and 2.4 we ended up adding react in the existing ui at `airflow/www`. We don't really need the `/ui` directory anymore. If we need it again, it'd probably be easier to start from scratch as opposed to updating a bunch of non-maintained code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull

this was \"racey\", so running multiple dags all updating the\r\nsame outlet dataset (or how I ran in to this: mapped tasks) would cause\r\nsome of them to fail with a unique constraing violation.\r\n\r\nThe fix has two paths, one generic and an optimized version for\r\nPostgres.\r\n\r\nThe generic one is likely slightly slower, and uses the pattern that the\r\nSQLA docs have for exactly this case. To quote\r\n\r\n> This pattern is ideal for situations such as using PostgreSQL and\r\n> catching IntegrityError to detect duplicate rows; PostgreSQL normally\r\n> aborts the entire tranasction when such an error is raised, however when\r\n> using SAVEPOINT, the outer transaction is maintained. In the example\r\n> below a list of data is persisted into the database, with the occasional\r\n> \"duplicate primary key\" record skipped, without rolling back the entire\r\n> operation:\r\n\r\nHowever for PostgreSQL specifically, there is a better approach we can\r\ndo: use it's `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` approach. This also allows us to\r\ndo the whole process in a single SQL statement for all outlet datasets (vs\r\n1 select + 1 insert per dataset for the slow path)\r\n\r\nFixes

PR contains the following:\r\n\r\n* adds more examples and explicit mention of imports of WeekDay enum in `BranchDayOfWeekOperator`.\r\n* adds back reference to now-deprecated kwarg, mentions that you should not use it (I saw something similar in the docs for other deprecated params and would think it's a good idea to have it in the docs since it's in the constructor)\r\n* adds more tasks in dag example for BranchDayOfWeekOperator so it's hopefully clearer on how to use WeekDay enum.\r\n* **somewhat code-affecting change**: adds type hints for the weekday sensor. I also updated hints for the week_day so it has the enum in it\r\n\r\nIt all should add more examples to both HowTo for the operator and the operator/sensor description in the docs\r\n\r\ncloses:

KPO tests were occasionally failing in CI because of race\r\ncondition between delete from previous test and running the\r\nfollowing tests. Simply speaking the pods run via KPO well\r\nnot immediately sometimes and the following test picked them\r\ntogether with the current pod and failed becasue of duplicate\r\npods. There was even a tearDown Delay of 1 second introduced\r\nas workaround to combat this problem.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it much better. Each POD in the KPO test gets\r\nunique label (derived from test name) and when executing the\r\nPOD this label is then used as selector, so that only the\r\n**just started** POD in current test are selected - not any\r\ndangling pod (being deleted) from the previous tests.\r\n\r\nThis not only removes flakiness of the tests, but also remove\r\nthe need of sleep, which speeds up the whole suite by whoooping\r\n33 seconds (there were 33 tests to run).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR contains the following:\r\n\r\n* adds more examples and explicit mention of imports of WeekDay enum in `BranchDayOfWeekOperator`.\r\n* adds back reference to now-deprecated kwarg, mentions that you should not use it (I saw something similar in the docs for other deprecated params and would think it's a good idea to have it in the docs since it's in the constructor)\r\n* adds more tasks in dag example for BranchDayOfWeekOperator so it's hopefully clearer on how to use WeekDay enum.\r\n* **somewhat code-affecting change**: adds type hints for the weekday sensor. I also updated hints for the week_day so it has the enum in it\r\n\r\nIt all should add more examples to both HowTo for the operator and the operator/sensor description in the docs\r\n\r\ncloses:
