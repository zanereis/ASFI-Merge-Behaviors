the BigQueryIO.Write transform doesn't allow CreateDisposition.CREATE_NEVER to be set when using a tablespec to determine the BigQuery table name dynamically at runtime.\r\n\r\nThis check was originally put in because it was assumed that BigQueryIO would need to create a new table every time the tablespec returns a table name that hasn't been seen before. Since then a new BigQuery feature was released which enables date partitioning within a single table, and is now the preferred way to shard data by date (instead of having a table per date). It should therefore be possible to use tablespec to write to a specific partition e.g. `my-project:dataset.my_table$20170407`, while setting CreateDisposition.CREATE_NEVER since we never need to create a new table.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the check so that CreateDisposition.CREATE_NEVER can be used with a

There was a race in which pipelines without PAsserts might\r\n   erroneously pass because they would be canceled, which would\r\n   in turn cause the watermarks to reach max infinity, which\r\n   would in turn (because there are no PAsserts) cause the main\r\n   streaming poll loop think the pipeline succeeded.\r\n\r\n   Fix this by making the error presence available to the main\r\n   polling loop, and only canceling from there.\r\n\r\n2. The fact we were canceling from two places meant we could\r\n   get double-cancelations that led to test failures.\r\n\r\nFix both these issues (I

Adds ProcessContext.updateWatermark(), currently allowed to be called only from SDF.

pull request adds support for data-dependent writes when using batch load jobs. This is accomplished via refactoring BigQueryIO into separate transforms, with the first being a common PrepareWrite transform that determines which tables records should go to, followed by transforms that know how to interpret this.\r\n\r\nOne side benefit of this refactoring is that the different components can be used on their own. For example, one request has been to allow dynamic creation of datasets in BigQueryIO. A user can now accomplish this by running PrepareWrite themselves, followed by their own custom transform to create datasets, and then the remaining transform.\r\n\r\nIn order to test this, BigQueryIOTest was modified to use a proper fake service, removing the dependency on mockito.\r\n\r\nR: @jkff

This pull request adds unit tests for Dataflow's `iobase.py`\r\n**Comments**: As this is my first PR to Beam, I erred on the side of caution, adding a large number of tests. The file I am testing is comprised largely of base classes with limited functionality, so these tests are very likely to be redundant, and debatably unnecessary. Please let me know, and I'll be sure to correct accordingly.","created_at":"2017-04-01T03:42:44Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T17:02:40Z","closed_at":"2017-04-03T17:02:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e498e4bda3744171b962938aac98d3479e7d09e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2397/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2397/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2397/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/9763c1dca9616c843bfe53f2ebf3e09eff48d0ef","head":{"label":null,"ref":"add-dataflow-iobase-tests","sha":"9763c1dca9616c843bfe53f2ebf3e09eff48d0ef","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"fe1d4124e7d51ec45869fb9e95cc8243f5891553","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50904245,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDkwNDI0NQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"apache/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam","description":"Apache
