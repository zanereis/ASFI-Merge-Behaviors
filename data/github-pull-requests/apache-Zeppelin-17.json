What is this PR for?\r\n`Zeppelin-0.8.1` and `Zeppelin-0.8.2` cannot fully support Spark 2.4 if `commons-lang3` has incompaitble version from the one in Spark 2.4. The branch-0.9 (master) has already been updated to `3.7`, however the branch-0.8 hasn't done these changes.\r\nBy updating the version from `3.4` to `3.7` we resolve the issue that I have reported on Jira regarding reading `CSV` and `JSON` files in Spark 2.4.x.\r\n\r\nNext release of `Zeppelin-0.8.x` can fully support Spark 2.4 without waiting for `Zeppelin 0.9.x`.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ZEPPELIN/issues/ZEPPELIN-3939\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* First time? Setup Travis CI: \r\nDone\r\n* Outline any manual steps to test the PR here.\r\nI have tested reading `CSV` and `JSON` in `Zeppelin-0.8.0` (released), `Zeppelin-0.8.1` (released), and `Zeppelin-0.8.2` (not released yet) by pointing SPARK_HOME to spark-2.4.0 and they all failed same as the Jira issue.\r\n```\r\njava.io.InvalidClassException: org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser; local class incompatible \r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter updating `common-lang3` to `3.7`, Zeppelin-0.8.2 reads the `CSV` and `JSON` files in spark-2.4.0 without any issue. \r\n\r\nThis has happened before and the solution was to update `commons-lang3` to appropriate version used in Apache Spark:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/zeppelin/commit/88a905caf2043d12a85462940c451b424d218dba\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? Yes\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-24T12:18:20Z","updated_at":"2019-02-12T13:11:25Z","closed_at":"2019-01-28T18:13:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55833ed1a82b8d13b671b483a32d6eb4c595c6d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3290/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3290/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3290/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/0709f5b4727a1586a7741d3991d41de1b20a9aac","head":{"label":"multivacplatform:branch-0.8","ref":"branch-0.8","sha":"0709f5b4727a1586a7741d3991d41de1b20a9aac","user":{"login":"multivacplatform","id":25272092,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI1MjcyMDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25272092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform","html_url":"https://github.com/multivacplatform","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157614071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc2MTQwNzE=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"multivacplatform/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"multivacplatform","id":25272092,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI1MjcyMDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25272092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform","html_url":"https://github.com/multivacplatform","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multivacplatform/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/multivacplatform/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nAdd `HADOOP_CLASSPATH` to `ZEPPELIN_CLASSPATH` when starting Zeppelin. This adds some important deps that Zeppelin may need. For instance when storing the notebooks in [Swift](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift) (an Hadoop-compatible storage system) Zeppelin need to use a driver that is generally included in `HADOOP_CLASSPATH`, but not in `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3949\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nThe Travis build should run just fine.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\nNope.

What is this PR for?\r\nIn the [spark_mesos example - Dockerfile](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/scripts/docker/spark-cluster-managers/spark_mesos/Dockerfile), there are some issues.\r\n\r\n1. The original used SPARK_VERSION=2.1.2 is not available now, update it to 2.4.0\r\n2. There is no package named libevent2-devel, it should be corrected to libevent-devel\r\n3. Update from centos6 to centos7\r\n4. Update from jdk7 to jdk8\r\n\r\n In the [spark_mesos example - entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/scripts/docker/spark-cluster-managers/spark_mesos/entrypoint.sh):\r\n\r\n1. Follow the instructions: [zeppelin on spark mesos mode - configure spark interpreter in zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.8.0/setup/deployment/spark_cluster_mode.html#4-configure-spark-interpreter-in-zeppelin-1) add the two environment variables.\r\n2. add --hostname flag to the command mesos-master. This solves the problem of \"Failed to connect to xx.xx.xx.xx:5050\"(screenshot).  \r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is \r\n\r\n- Bug Fix\r\n\r\n- Improvement\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n*

What is this PR for?\r\nAt present, Bind's angularObject in note is only valid in the current operation web page.\r\nWhen the note is reopened, or the zeppelin service is restarted, the angularObject of Bind in the note cannot be displayed, and the bind operation must be repeated.\r\n\r\nThe submarine has a lot of startup commands and parameters. In order to provide the best experience for the user, we provide the parameters to the user through the WEB control.\r\n\r\nZeppelin's own dynamic form is more suitable for parameter input in the query, but it does not meet the needs of the submarine interpreter, so the submarine interpreter uses the angular template to generate a richer input interface.\r\nThe controls in the interface are saved to the note through Bind's angularObject, so that when the user reopens the note, there is no need to re-enter it.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] Save angularObject to Note in NotebookServer::angularObjectClientBind(...) function.\r\n* [x] Delete angularObject to Note in NotebookServer::angularObjectClientUnbind(...) function.\r\n* [x] Update angularObject to Note in NotebookServer:: angularObjectUpdated(...) function.\r\n* [x] Load angularObject update to Note in NotebookServer::getNote(...) function.\r\n* [x] Add test case in NotebookServerTest::testAngularObjectSaveToNote(...).\r\n* [x] Add test case in NotebookServerTest::testLoadAngularObjectFromNote(...).\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3931\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n[CI pass](https://travis-ci.org/liuxunorg/zeppelin/builds/473897099)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/liuxunorg/images/blob/master/zeppelin/angularBing-save.gif?raw=true \"angularBing-save.gif\")\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-31T17:15:07Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T02:55:27Z","closed_at":"2019-02-03T02:55:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdc8dd0d9fd34d8763dba0aa37f891c17eef7cfa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3278/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3278/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3278/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/96cd90b44973eeabdaa889753be7eaa3879b22bd","head":{"label":"xunliu:ZEPPELIN-3931","ref":"ZEPPELIN-3931","sha":"96cd90b44973eeabdaa889753be7eaa3879b22bd","user":{"login":"xunliu","id":3677382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzczODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3677382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu","html_url":"https://github.com/xunliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144678681,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ2Nzg2ODE=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"xunliu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xunliu","id":3677382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzczODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3677382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu","html_url":"https://github.com/xunliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xunliu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nNow the execution of the paragraph in zeppelin only supports the display of a single URL link, for example: Spark paragraph execution is a Spark JOB URL link.\r\nThe machine learning task in the hadoop submarine needs to provide the user with a tensorflow Parameter server, a tensorflow worker server log link in YARN, and a tensorboard link, so a custom menu display that supports multiple URL links is now available.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] Add testRuntimeInfos test cases in NotebookServerTest.java\r\n* [x] modify paragraph-control.html\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3920\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n[CI

What is this PR for?\r\nMaking SecurityService more configurable. Currently, SecurityUtils consists of static methods, and which means it's not extendable and pluggable. It would be better if users could implement new security features easily.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Introduce `SecurityService` as an interface to support security features\r\n* [x] - Move `SecurityUtils` to `ShiroSecurityService` as an implementation of `SecurityService`\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3892\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* This is a refactoring. It should pass all of the current tests\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?

What type of PR is it?\r\nThis PR adds ability to run Zeppelin on Kubernetes. It aims\r\n\r\n - Zero configuration to start Zeppelin on Kubernetes. (and Spark on Kubernetes)\r\n - Run everything on Kubernetes: Zeppelin, Interpreters, Spark.\r\n - Highly customizable to adopt various user configurations and extensions.\r\n\r\nKey features are \r\n\r\n - Provides zeppelin-server.yaml file for `kubectl` to run Zeppelin server\r\n - All interpreters are automatically running as a Pod.\r\n - Spark interpreter automatically configured to use [Spark on Kubernetes](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html)\r\n - Reverse proxy is configured to access Spark UI\r\n\r\nTo do\r\n - [x] Document how reverse proxy for Spark UI works and how to configure custom domain.\r\n - [x] Document how to customize zeppelin-server and interpreter yaml.\r\n - [x] Document new configurations\r\n - [x] Document how to mount volume for notebook and configurations\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\n\r\n#### Run Zeppelin Server on Kubernetes\r\n`k8s/zeppelin-server.yaml` is provided to run Zeppelin Server with few sidecars and configurations.\r\nThis file is easy to publish (user can easily consume it using `curl`), highly customizable while it includes all the necessary things.\r\n\r\n#### K8s Interpreter launcher\r\nThis PR adds new module, `launcher-k8s-standard` under `zeppelin/zeppelin-plugins/launcher/k8s-standard/` directory. This launcher is [automatically being selected](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3240/files#diff-82fddd2ffb77aaffc4b9cf7b5b1eaa79) when Zeppelin is running on Kubernetes. The launcher both handles Spark interpreter and All other interpreters.\r\n\r\nThe launcher launches interpreter as a Pod using template [k8s/interpreter/100-interpreter-pod.yaml](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3240/files#diff-d9ce62e2c992d32f0184d7edb862f3c4).\r\nReason filename has `100-` in prefix is because all files in the directory is consumed in alphabetical order by launcher on interpreter start/stop. User can drop more files here to extend/customize interpreter, and filename can be used to control order. The template is rendered by [jinjava](https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava).\r\n\r\n#### Spark interpreter\r\n\r\nWhen interpreter group is `spark`, K8sRemoteInterpreterProcess [sets necessary spark configuration](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3240/files#diff-6d1d3084f55bdd519e39ede4a619e73dR297) automatically to use [Spark on Kubernetes](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/running-on-kubernetes.html). User doesn't have to configure anything. It uses client mode.\r\n\r\n#### Spark UI\r\n\r\nWe may make user manually configure port-forward or do something to access Spark UI, but that's not optimal. It is the best when Spark UI is automatically accessible when user have access to Zeppelin UI, without any extra configuration. \r\n\r\nTo enable this, Zeppelin server Pod has a reverse proxy as a sidecar, and it split traffic to Zeppelin server and Spark UI running in the other Pod. It assume both `service.domain.com` and `*.service.domain.com` point the nginx proxy address. `service.domain.com` is directed to ZeppelinServer, `*.service.domain.com` is directed to interpreter Pod.\r\n\r\n`<port>-<interpreter pod svc name>.service.domain.com` is convention to access any application running in interpreter Pod. If Spark interpreter Pod is running with a name `spark-axefeg` and Spark UI is running on port 4040, \r\n\r\n```\r\n4040-spark-axefeg.service.domain.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nis the address to access Spark UI. Default service domain is [local.zeppelin-project.org:8080](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/3240/files#diff-56ccb2e2c2617b27dbaae866d9431e51R22), while `local.zeppelin-project.org` and `*.local.zeppelin-project.org` point `127.0.0.1`, and it works with `kubectl port-forward`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3840\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nPrepare a Kubernetes cluster with enough resources (cpus > 5, mem > 6g).\r\nIf you're using [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube), check your capacity using `kubectl describe node` command before start.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to build Zeppelin docker image and Spark docker image to test. Please follow guide docs/quickstart/kubernetes.md.\r\n\r\nTo quickly try without building docker images, I have uploaded pre-built image on docker hub `moon/zeppelin:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT`, `moon/spark:2.4.0`. Try following command\r\n\r\n```\r\nZEPPELIN_SERVER_YAML=\"curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin/kubernetes/k8s/zeppelin-server.yaml\"\r\n$ZEPPELIN_SERVER_YAML | sed 's/apache\\/zeppelin:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/moon\\/zeppelin:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/' | sed 's/spark:2.4.0/moon\\/spark:2.4.0/' | kubectl apply -f -\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd port forward\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl port-forward zeppelin-server 8080:80\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd browse http://localhost:8080\r\n\r\nTo clean up\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ZEPPELIN_SERVER_YAML | sed 's/apache\\/zeppelin:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/moon\\/zeppelin:0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/' | sed 's/spark:2.4.0/moon\\/spark:2.4.0/' | kubectl delete -f -\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nSee this video https://youtu.be/7E4ZGn4pnTo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n\r\n - Per interpreter docker image\r\n - Blocking communication between interpreter Pod.\r\n - Spark Interpreter Pod has Role CRUD for any pod/service in the same namespace. Which should be restricted to only Spark executors Pod.\r\n - Per note interpreter mode by default when Zeppelin is running on Kubernetes\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? yes\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-24T10:33:38Z","updated_at":"2019-05-03T22:43:12Z","closed_at":"2019-01-18T17:00:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b4bf8e0810e5d3895de0e1390af61bd85b37202","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/0100a36f2f8d4b0153490c5d542f149b3917b086","head":{"label":"Leemoonsoo:kubernetes","ref":"kubernetes","sha":"0100a36f2f8d4b0153490c5d542f149b3917b086","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32886931,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg4NjkzMQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Leemoonsoo/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR introduces code to configure manually the \"maxRows\" and \"rowsFetchSize\" Statement settings directly from the interpreter/jdbc/interpreter-setting.json file. The default value for these two settings is 1000 which can slow down a Zeppelin instance quite a lot if a SQL query returns a big chunk of data.

sense.\r\n\r\nThanks!","created_at":"2018-11-23T23:55:36Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T07:46:06Z","closed_at":"2018-12-14T01:18:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da8851e4a9c7c1980555bbd7c6f723324bc70e7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3239/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3239/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3239/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/b27ebbba0d16dcbf5c79bc2bd2015f30a66a278e","head":{"label":"monsieurp:ZEPPELIN-3879","ref":"ZEPPELIN-3879","sha":"b27ebbba0d16dcbf5c79bc2bd2015f30a66a278e","user":{"login":"monsieurp","id":350116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDExNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/350116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monsieurp","html_url":"https://github.com/monsieurp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monsieurp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monsieurp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monsieurp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monsieurp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monsieurp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monsieurp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monsieurp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monsieurp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monsieurp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a02e8e0f9fde8372ff0eea0e674f72bb8be15875","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

like\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuild https://travis-ci.org/test/zeppelin/builds/451036679\r\n[1] OK              https://travis-ci.org/test/zeppelin/jobs/451036680\r\n[2] Running ...

failed job, developer has to open the travis-ci link and download the log and manually look through to see what was wrong.\r\n\r\nThis PR make Jenkins not only print build status but also short summary of failure, so developer quickly identify what went wrong.
