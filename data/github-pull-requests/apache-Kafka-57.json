OffsetCommit API Version 9](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14690)\r\n\r\nThis change introduces topic ids in `OffsetCommit` requests and responses. The approach chosen in the PR is to support references to topics by either their ID or name (but not both at the same time). \r\n\r\nTopic IDs are not surfaced to the Kafka consumer APIs. \r\n\r\nOn the consumer-side, topic IDs and names are resolved using the client-side cached metadata. On brokers, the metadata cache is used. If a topic ID cannot be resolved on the broker, the corresponding topic will be assigned an `UNKNOWN_TOPIC_ID` in the `OffsetCommit` response.\r\n\r\nThis PR is written as part of [KIP-848: The Next Generation of the Consumer Rebalance Protocol](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-848).\r\n\r\n**Out of scope**\r\n- The admin client continues to use OffsetCommit version 8, without topic ids.\r\n- Support of topic ids for offset commits in the new component `CommitRequestManager` will be added in [KAFKA-14777](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14777).\r\n\r\n#### Request path on the consumer\r\n\r\n![KAFKA-14690 drawio (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/638312/222811767-1ed2b70b-e111-4e41-8235-a5c123469a41.png)\r\n\r\n#### Request path on the broker\r\n\r\nRequests version >= 9 use topic ids exclusively. Brokers resolve the topic name in the request handler based on cached metadata. The request is then propagated to the group coordinator which constructs the response with topic names as of time of this PR. The resolution of topic name back to topic ID is performed when the response from the group coordinator is merged with the partial response for topic with error (if any).\r\n\r\n![KAFKA-14690

a leader becomes a follower, it is likely that it has uncommitted records in its log. When it reaches out to the leader, the leader will detect that they have diverged and it will return the diverging epoch and offset. The follower truncates it log based on this.\r\n\r\nThere is a small caveat in this process. When the leader return the diverging epoch and offset, it also includes its high watermark, low watermark, start offset and end offset. The current code in the `AbstractFetcherThread` works as follow. First it process the partition data and then it checks whether there is a diverging epoch/offset. The former may accidentally expose uncommitted records as this step updates the local watermark to whatever is received from the leader. As the follower, or the former leader, may have uncommitted records, it will be able to updated the high watermark to a larger offset if the leader has a higher watermark than the current local one. This result in exposing uncommitted records until the log is finally truncated. The time window is short but a fetch requests coming at the right time to the follower could read those records. This is especially true for clients out there which uses recent versions of the fetch request but without implementing KIP-320.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, the follower logs the following messages: \r\n* `Truncating XXX to offset 21434 below high watermark 21437`\r\n* `Non-monotonic update of high watermark from (offset=21437 segment=[20998:98390]) to (offset=21434 segment=[20998:97843])`.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to mitigate the issue by starting by checking on whether a diverging epoch/offset is provided by the leader and skip processing the partition data if it is. This basically means that the first fetch request will result in truncating the log and a subsequent fetch request will update the log/high watermarks.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

currently cache login managers in static maps for both static JAAS config using system property and for JAAS config specified using Kafka config `sasl.jaas.config`. In addition to the JAAS config, the login manager callback handler is included in the key, but all other configs are ignored. This implementation is based on the assumption clients that require different logins (e.g. username/password) use different JAAS configs, because login properties are included in the JAAS config rather than as separate top-level configs. The OIDC support added in KIP-768 only allows configuration of token endpoint URL as a top-level config. This results in two clients in a JVM configured with different token endpoint URLs to incorrectly share a login.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes all SASL configs prefixed with `sasl.` to be included in the key so that logins are only shared if all the sasl configs are identical.\r\n\r\nTwo rejected approaches:\r\n1) Only include `sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url` in the key. Rejected because there may be other configs in future for which we want different logins. It may also be useful to have a mechanism to force different logins when using custom configs, `sasl.` prefix would work in general.\r\n2) Include all configs in the key. Kafka brokers create multiple inter-broker clients with different configs, e.g. client.id. We want brokers to create only one login, hence chose a subset based on the `sasl.` prefix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

raft idle ratio is currently computed as the average of all recorded poll durations. This tends to underestimate the actual idle ratio since it treats all measurements equally regardless how much time was spent. For example, say we poll twice with the following durations:\r\n\r\nPoll 1: 2s\r\nPoll 2: 0s\r\n\r\nAssume that the busy time is negligible, so 2s passes overall.\r\n\r\nIn the first measurement, 2s is spent waiting, so we compute and record a ratio of 1.0. In the second measurement, no time passes, and we record 0.0. The idle ratio is then computed as the average of these two values (1.0 + 0.0 / 2 = 0.5), which suggests that the process was busy for 1s, which overestimates the true busy time.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, I've created a new `TimeRatio` class which tracks the total duration of a periodic event over a full interval of time measurement.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

PR adds the TierStateMachine interface to handle all state transitions related to tiered storage and building the remote log aux state.\r\n\r\nThe new interface supports a `start` and `maybeAdvanceState`. In the `ReplicaFetcherTierStateMachine`, the `maybeAdvanceState` is unused since the implementation is synchronous. Only the `start` is needed. This PR keeps the addition of the `maybeAdvanceState` because there is an existing task for building the remote log aux state in an asynchronous manner that will be able to use the full interface

patch adds the broker side `PartitionAssignor` interface as detailed in KIP-848. The interfaces differs a bit from the KIP in the following ways:\r\n* The POJOs are not defined within the interface because the interface is to heavy like this.\r\n* The interface is kept in the `group-coordinator` module for now. We don't want to have it out there until KIP-848 is ready to be released. We will move it to its final destination later.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

pr include \r\n- The changes include switching Scala code to java\r\n- Move TopicCommand and all test cases to tools\r\n\r\nSome implementation notes:\r\n- I added `ToolsTestUtils.createBrokerProperties` as a wrapper for `TestUtils.createBrokerConfig` to avoid converting between `Map<Integer, String>` and `Map<Int, String>`.\r\n- Replicated `TestUtils.setReplicationThrottleForPartitions` and `TestUtils.removeReplicationThrottleForPartitions` to `ToolsTestUtils` as the methods are used only `TopicCommandIntegrationTest` and `ReassignPartitionsIntegrationTest`. We need to remove it from `TestUtils` once we migrate `ReassignPartitions`\r\n- Replicated `TestInfoUtils.TestWithParameterizedQuorumName` to `ToolsTestUtils` as java convert this into a getter function which cannot be used with `ParameterizedTest`\r\n- Move `CoreUtils.duplicate` to `ToolsUtils`\r\n- <del>Move `TopicFilter` out of core. (This is part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14647 which seems not moving for a while  )</del> Used #13158 \r\n- <del>Duplicate `AdminCommandFailedException` and `AdminOperationException` out of core. </del> Used the new exceptions from #13278 \r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

the context of KIP-848, we implements are new group coordinator in Java. This new coordinator follows the architecture of the new quorum controller. It is basically a replicated state machine that writes to the log and commits its internal state when the writes are committed. At the moment, the only way to know when a write is committed is to use a delayed fetch. This is not ideal in our context because a delayed fetch can be completed before the write is actually committed to the log.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to introduce a high watermark listener to the Partition/Log layers. This will allow the new group coordinator to simply listen to changes and commit its state based on this. This mechanism is simpler and lighter as well.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

Handling of consumer rebalance related failures in sink tasks was added in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/767\r\n- Exceptions thrown in the consumer rebalance listener are swallowed by the consumer; so the `WorkerSinkTask` stores exceptions arising from handling of assigned / revoked partitions and re-throws it in `WorkerSinkTask::pollConsumer` after the consumer poll returns.\r\n- This exception is propagated up from `WorkerSinkTask::pollConsumer` <- `WorkerSinkTask::poll` <- `WorkerSinkTask::iteration` <- `WorkerSinkTask::execute` <- `WorkerTask::doRun` <- `WorkerTask::run` where it is finally handled by marking the task as failed -

`Exceptions raised from the task during a rebalance should be rethrown to stop the worker` is inaccurate (the *worker* itself isn't stopped, the task is) and is being reworded.\r\n\r\n### Committer

is the first part of the above ticket, applied only to SinkConnector and SourceConnector plugins.\r\nAdditional PRs will cover the other plugins, as the refactor was too large to reasonably review at once.\r\n\r\nDesign decisions:\r\n1. The `IsolatedPlugin<P>` class will be a common superclass for all plugin wrappers.\r\n2. The `IsolatedPlugin` superclass provides utility methods for subclasses to manage swapping the ThreadContextClassLoader for each call in a way that has minimal boilerplate.\r\n3. The `Isolated*` classes are intended to only be constructed within the plugin isolation infrastructure, and will all have package-local constructors.\r\n4. Testing runtime code that uses wrapped plugins will require mocking the wrappers, or instantiating a real Plugins class.\r\n5. Subclasses should define public methods which match the plugin class they are wrapping without being an explicit subclass. These methods should be marked with `throws Exception` to remind callers that they may throw arbitrary exceptions.\r\n\r\nOpen questions/issues:\r\n1. The `hashCode`, `equals`, and `toString` methods do not have `throws Exception` as the Object class does not have these throws clauses. That means that calling code cannot be forced to handle exceptions from these methods. For toString, the exception message is provided in place of the toString result, and the hashCode and equals are wholly decoupled from the underlying hashCode and equals implementations.\r\n2. The wrapper method signatures throw `Exception` and not `Throwable`. The distinction being that `Exception`s are considered by the Java Language to be reasonable to catch in an application, and `Throwable`s were not. I wasn't sure whether the Connect runtime should be forced to handle errors like OutOfMemoryError, LinkageError, etc, or just let them propagate and kill the calling thread.\r\n3. These wrappers do not enforce that the methods are not called on the herder thread, because I didn't come up with an elegant way to do so.\r\n4. I did a first-pass at propagating and handling the exceptions thrown by the connector classes, but I don't know if they are reasonable. Now that the exceptions are checked, the code enforces that exceptions are handled, but it is still up to us to determine the proper way to handle the exceptions.\r\n5. This PR does not remove existing loaderSwap calls that are currently ensuring isolation. Those can be moved/removed after all of this refactor lands, as it may still be necessary for the other plugins.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

[Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14610) contains a more detailed description of the motivation for this change. To summarize, if there are bursty topic partitions, offset sync starvation can occur since MM2 limits the number of in-flight syncs at one time.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to enqueue the latest applicable offset for any to-be-synced topic partition in the `commitRecord` method, immediately fire off all syncs that can be published in that method, and then periodically re-check for new syncs in `commit` in case there are syncs that could not be published due to, e.g., a burst of throughput on a topic partition.\r\n\r\nThis way, existing behavior is largely preserved for the initial series of offset syncs, due to the immediate attempt to publish syncs in `commitRecord`, but improved upon for later offset syncs that may be skipped by the current logic, due to the subsequent attempts to publish syncs in `commit`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

primary issue being addressed here is the incorrect translation of offsets, the title issue [KAFKA-12468](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12468).\r\nAdditionally, this PR addresses [KAFKA-13659](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13659), which prevents MirrorCheckpointTasks that restart from emitting checkpoints before they can read to the end of the offset syncs topic.\r\nAdditionally, this PR stabilizes the MirrorMaker2 integration tests which were too flakey to properly verify this fix.\r\n\r\nThe [MM2 KIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-382%3A+MirrorMaker+2.0) does not discuss the offset translation mechanism in detail, so I'll summarize the mechanism as it currently exists on trunk:\r\n1. Records are mirrored from source topic-partition to target topic-partition by the MirrorSourceTask\r\n2. MirrorSourceTask will (occasionally) emit OffsetSync messages to an Offset Syncs topic. Offset syncs contain the upstream and downstream offset of an emitted data record.\r\n3. The MirrorCheckpointTask will consume from the offset syncs topic, and maintain an in-memory copy of the latest offset sync seen for each topic-partition (in OffsetSyncStore)\r\n4. Periodically the MirrorCheckpointTask will poll consumer group offsets for the source topic, and use it's in-memory copy of the latest offset sync to translate upstream offsets to downstream offsets.\r\n5. This is done by measuring the 'distance' between the MM2 offset sync and the upstream consumer group, and then assuming that the same distance applies in the downstream topic.\r\n\r\nStep (5) is correct when assuming that every *offset* from the source topic has already been reproduced in the downstream topic. However, this assumption is violated when offsets are not present, which can happen for a variety of reasons, including:\r\n1. Transaction markers take an offset but will never be emitted as records from the consumer\r\n2. Records are dropped by SMTs and will never be emitted to the target topic\r\n3. The source topic has been compacted and some offsets will never be emitted by the consumer\r\n4. MM2 replication is lagging behind an upstream consumer group and some records have not been replicated yet\r\n\r\nIn any of these conditions, an upstream offset may be translated to a downstream offset which is beyond the corresponding record in the downstream topic. Consider the following concrete example of situation (4) **resulting in negative lag**:\r\n1. Source topic `A` has 1000 records, all with contiguous offsets\r\n2. An upstream consumer group `cg` is at the end of the log, offset 1000.\r\n3. MM2 begins replicating the topic, and writes 500 upstream records to the target topic `target.A`, and writes offset-syncs correlating (`A`, 500) with (`target.A`, 500).\r\n4. MM2 checkpoint reads `cg` offset 1000, translates the offset to 500 + (1000-500) = 1000, and writes to `target.cg`\r\n5. Someone checks the `target.cg` offset for `target.A` and observes that the group offset is 1000, the topic end offset is 500, and the lag is -500.\r\n\r\nAnd the following concrete example of situation (1) **resulting in undelivered data**.\r\n1. Source topic `A` has 1000 records, all emitted with a transactional producer.\r\n2. The 1000 records are interleaved with 1000 commit markers at every other offset.\r\n3. An upstream consumer group `cg` is in the middle of the topic, at offset 1000.\r\n4. MM2 begins replicating the topic, and writes 1000 records to the target topic `target.A`, and writes offset-syncs correlating (`A`, 500) with (`target.A`, 250), in addition to other offset-syncs.\r\n5. MM2 checkpoint reads the `cg` offset 1000, translates the offset to 250 + (1000 - 500) = 750, and writes to `target.cg`\r\n6. A system fails-over from `cg` to `target.cg` and someone notices that the `cg` application read records 0-500, `target.cg` application read 750-1000, but no consumer ever received offsets 500-750.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a test that replicates transactional data, as in situation (1). It asserts that whenever an offset is translated, it does not pass the end of the downstream topic, and cannot cause negative lag. In addition the tests are strengthened to require the offset syncs to be emitted up to the end of the topic, requiring a fix for the offset-syncs topic starvation issue. This also exposed a number of mistakes and flakiness in the existing tests, so this PR also stabilizes the tests to make them useful for validating the negative offsets fix.\r\n\r\n### Committer

minor improvements to the JavaDoc for ZkMigrationState.\r\n\r\nRename MigrationState to MigrationDriverState to avoid confusion with ZkMigrationState.\r\n\r\nRemove ClusterImage#zkBrokers. This costs O(num_brokers) time to calculate, but is only ever used when in migration state. It should just be calculated in the migration code. (Additionally, the function ClusterImage.zkBrokers() returns something other than ClusterImage#zkBrokers, which is confusing.)\r\n\r\nAlso remove ClusterDelta#liveZkBrokerIdChanges. This is only used in one place, and it's easy to calculate it there. In general we should avoid providing expensive accessors unless absolutely necessary. Expensive code should look expensive: if people want to iterate over all brokers, they can write a loop to do that rather than hiding it inside an accessor.","created_at":"2023-01-30T23:17:19Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T22:23:14Z","closed_at":"2023-02-28T22:23:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8456c4fd549ccec79f0dbccd18a9ace8a6d2d150","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13176/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13176/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13176/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f11c152fb6ac4ad944b258d09adb3832d77634bf","head":{"label":"cmccabe:some-migration-code-cleanups","ref":"some-migration-code-cleanups","sha":"f11c152fb6ac4ad944b258d09adb3832d77634bf","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

we are listening on fixed ports, we should defer opening ports until we're ready to accept\r\ntraffic. If we open the broker port too early, it can confuse monitoring and deployment systems.\r\nThis is a particular concern when in KRaft mode, since in that mode, we create the SocketServer\r\nobject earlier in the startup process than when in ZK mode.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken in this PR is to defer opening the acceptor port until Acceptor.start is called.\r\nNote that when we are listening on a random port, we continue to open the port \"early,\" in the\r\nSocketServer constructor. The reason for doing this is that there is no other way to find the\r\nrandom port number the kernel has selected. Since random port assignment is not used in production\r\ndeployments, this should be reasonable.\r\n\r\nFutureUtils.java: add chainFuture and tests.\r\n\r\nSocketServerTest.scala: add timeouts to cases where we call get() on futures.","created_at":"2023-01-27T00:14:26Z","updated_at":"2023-02-03T00:14:45Z","closed_at":"2023-02-01T17:42:03Z","merged_at":"2023-02-01T17:42:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"6625214c52961fc40b7992a031d60c6805db4cec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ac283f1ba4d0ca0cbea6612ea97490a427062472","head":{"label":"cmccabe:port-opening-fix","ref":"port-opening-fix","sha":"ac283f1ba4d0ca0cbea6612ea97490a427062472","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

sure no scaladoc warnings are emitted from the streams-scala project build. We cannot fully fix all scaladoc warnings due to limitations of the scaladoc tool, so this is a best-effort attempt at fixing as many warnings as possible. We also disable one problematic class of scaladoc wornings (link errors) in the gradle build.\r\n\r\nThe causes of existing warnings are that we link to java members from scaladoc, which is not possible, or we fail to disambiguate some members.\r\n\r\nThe broad rule applied in the changes is\r\n - For links to Java members such as [[StateStore]], we use the fully qualified name in a code tag to make manual link resolution via a search engine easy.\r\n - For some common terms that are also linked to Java members, like [[Serde]], we omit the link.\r\n - We disambiguate where possible.\r\n - In the special case of @throws declarations with Java Exceptions, we do not seem to be able to avoid the warning altogther.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-25T18:00:28Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T17:00:57Z","closed_at":"2023-01-31T17:00:49Z","merged_at":"2023-01-31T17:00:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb7f490159c924ca0f21394d58366c257998f52e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":820768376,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NjgzNzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/docs","name":"docs","color":"017c4f","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13164/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13164/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13164/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c463e9839ca17ac04eb252867ba798be06e30e52","head":{"label":"lucasbru:fix_scaladoc_warnings","ref":"fix_scaladoc_warnings","sha":"c463e9839ca17ac04eb252867ba798be06e30e52","user":{"login":"lucasbru","id":1628637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjg2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1628637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasbru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":533369486,"node_id":"R_kgDOH8qSjg","name":"kafka","full_name":"lucasbru/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lucasbru","id":1628637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjg2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1628637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasbru","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasbru/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lucasbru/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch fixes a major issue where brokers were rejecting the initial LISR sent during the ZK migration. This happens when the KRaft controller claims the controller leadership in ZK before the ZK brokers learn about a recently restarted ZK broker. For example, if the KRaft controller is already running and ZK brokers are restarted in migration mode, the last ZK broker may not be seen as \"alive\" by the other ZK brokers since the KRaft controller takes over before the UMR is sent by the ZK controller.\r\n\r\nThe result is the ZK brokers reject the LISR that are first sent by the KRaft controller and ISRs are not able to be expanded.\r\n\r\nAn integration test is included that exercises this path. \r\n\r\nA number of other small fixes for dual-write are included in this patch as well. These are also exercised as part of the integration test.

immediately saw a failure with `stateUpdaterEnabled = true` after disabling the `false` parameter, which suggests the problem actually does lie in the state updater itself and not the act of parametrization of the test. To verify this theory, and help stabilize the 3.4 release branch, let's try one more test by swapping out the `true` build in favor of the `false` one. If the `listOffsets` requests stop failing and causing this integration test to hit the global timeout as is currently happening at such a high rate, then we have pretty good evidence pointing at the

pull request adds new functions to the Producer.java file in the examples directory to provide more flexibility for clients using Kafka. The `sendToMultipleTopics` method allows clients to send a message to multiple topics in a round-robin fashion. The `sendWithKey` method allows clients to send a message to a specific topic with a key for custom partitioning. The `sendWithTimestamp` method allows clients to send a message to a specific topic with a timestamp for custom time-based event streaming.\r\n\r\nThese new functions will help clients to have more control over the messages they are sending and to improve the functionality of their producer when using the examples in the repository. As a result, clients will be able to better understand and utilize the capabilities of Kafka.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-23T21:51:34Z","updated_at":"2024-12-27T03:38:09Z","closed_at":"2024-12-27T03:38:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

we don't switch to the classloader of a plugin before loading or using its `ConfigDef`, then classloading bugs can appear for, e.g., properties with the `CLASS` type. See https://github.com/kcctl/kcctl/issues/266 for an instance of this kind of bug.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a classloader swap in the part of the code base that's responsible for servicing requests to the `GET /connector-plugins/<type>/config` endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe existing monolithic unit test for this logic is broken out into dedicated individual unit tests for each kind of connector plugin; this is done to avoid having to reset expectations on the mocked `Plugins` object when verifying calls to `withClassLoader`, since in the unit testing environment the same classloader may be used for multiple different plugin
