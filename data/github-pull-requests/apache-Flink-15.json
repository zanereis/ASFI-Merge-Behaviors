What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a series of sub-PRs to support state access on Datastream API v2 (FLIP-433)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce generic type descriptors. They are used to generate TypeInformation instances\r\n  - Introduce state declarations. They represent parametrized declaration of different states, such as List, Map, Broadcast state\r\n  - Introduce interfaces for declaring (via `usesStates()`) of their input\r\n  - Bridge `StateManager` `getState()` with underlying state infrastructure\r\n  - Support compile-time checks for state incompatibilities\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is covered by tests:\r\n- `TypeDescriptionUtilsTest`\r\n- `DefaultStateManagerTest`\r\n- `BroadcastStreamImplTest`\r\n- `GlobalStreamImplTest`\r\n- `KeyedPartitionStreamImplTest`\r\n- `NonKeyedPartitionStreamImplTest`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-32843][JUnit5 Migration] Migrate the jobmaster package of flink-runtime module to JUnit5\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Remove the TestingComponentMainThreadExecutor.Resource\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Remove the deprecated PhysicalSlotProviderResource.java\r\n\r\n\r\n- Migrate the jobmaster package of flink-runtime module to JUnit5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Introduce the PhysicalSlotProviderExtension.java to replace the PhysicalSlotProviderResource.java\r\n\r\n\r\n- Add the comments about deprecated details for TestingComponentMainThreadExecutor.Resource\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-25T13:52:53Z","updated_at":"2024-05-06T01:13:54Z","closed_at":"2024-05-06T01:13:54Z","merged_at":"2024-05-06T01:13:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"beb0b167bdcf95f27be87a214a69a174fd49d256","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24723/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24723/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24723/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bf8d5cf1a3bc30a69a5dcc114b36420f7c753537","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:FLINK-32843_runtime_jm","ref":"FLINK-32843_runtime_jm","sha":"bf8d5cf1a3bc30a69a5dcc114b36420f7c753537","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1.19 is our current stable release. Therefore, we should not show an outdated warning message.\r\n\r\nIt looks like we accidentally changed this with https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24547 as part of the 1.19 release.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Set ShowOutDatedWarning = false*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n- See [FLIP-441](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-441%3A+Show+the+JobType+and+remove+Execution+Mode+on+Flink+WebUI) get more details.\r\n- Currently, the jobType has 2 types in Flink: STREAMING and BATCH. They work on completely different principles, such as: scheduler, shuffle, join, etc. These differences lead to different troubleshooting processes, so when users are maintaining a job or troubleshooting, it's needed to know whether the current job is a STREAMING or BATCH job. Unfortunately, Flink WebUI doesn't expose it to the users so far.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- [FLINK-35222][rest] Add getJobType for AccessExecutionGraph\r\n- [FLINK-35223][rest] Add jobType in JobDetailsInfo related rest api\r\n- [FLINK-35224][web] Show the JobType on Flink WebUI\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTest manually for running job : \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/38427477/86c449a1-9e14-4af5-9d82-fa8a594e0b8e)\r\n\r\n\r\nTest manually for History

JobType, and rest of information are fine):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/38427477/09ee9268-35fa-4c85-ad4f-86b2c796e019)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-25T01:59:27Z","updated_at":"2024-04-28T07:39:28Z","closed_at":"2024-04-28T07:39:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e22c32fd3076f15679f7b3a881368791f4342043","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/490fd609f30646113e44668116eb2527f2176b8f","head":{"label":"dianfu:FLINK-35208","ref":"FLINK-35208","sha":"490fd609f30646113e44668116eb2527f2176b8f","user":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":93816928,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MzgxNjkyOA==","name":"flink","full_name":"dianfu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dianfu","id":5466492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjY0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5466492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu","html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dianfu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dianfu/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-24T15:00:13Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T17:23:32Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da1c4cf49543fc686da90421635cd324b7dfc48c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ad7d28d438ff7eee70db4f0bdee8e941459d26ed","head":{"label":"ottobricks:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"ad7d28d438ff7eee70db4f0bdee8e941459d26ed","user":{"login":"ottobricks","id":22245994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjQ1OTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22245994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":791347224,"node_id":"R_kgDOLysAGA","name":"flink","full_name":"ottobricks/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ottobricks","id":22245994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjQ1OTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22245994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks","html_url":"https://github.com/ottobricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ottobricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ottobricks/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAccording to Hive user documentation[1], starting from version 0.13.0, Hive prohibits the use of reserved keywords as identifiers. Moreover, versions 2.1.0 and earlier allow using SQL11 reserved keywords as identifiers by setting `hive.support.sql11.reserved.keywords=false` in hive-site.xml. This compatibility feature facilitates jobs that utilize keywords as identifiers.\r\n\r\nHiveParser in Flink, relying on Hive version 2.3.9, lacks the option to treat SQL11 reserved keywords as identifiers. This poses a challenge for users migrating SQL from Hive 1.x to Flink SQL, as they might encounter scenarios where keywords are used as identifiers. Addressing this issue is necessary to support such cases.\r\n\r\n[1] [LanguageManual DDL - Apache Hive - Apache Software Foundation](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Modify the ANTLR Files for Parsing Hive Syntax.*\r\n  - *Add introduction in

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-24T08:50:24Z","updated_at":"2024-06-07T14:03:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d7f8f6d2903f9acad482409b8e1e7f7a877da86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24708/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24708/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24708/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/03a4e3f9d454d60eff34bd32333e9ac217678eac","head":{"label":"nodejh:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"03a4e3f9d454d60eff34bd32333e9ac217678eac","user":{"login":"nodejh","id":10287125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg3MTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10287125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":560839021,"node_id":"R_kgDOIW25bQ","name":"flink","full_name":"nodejh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nodejh","id":10287125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg3MTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10287125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh","html_url":"https://github.com/nodejh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nodejh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nodejh/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWatermark alignment maxAllowedWatermarkDrift and updateInterval param need check\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nWatermark alignment maxAllowedWatermarkDrift and updateInterval param are duration, they need to be verified, otherwise it will lead to some abnormal situations, just add a check maxAllowedWatermarkDrift and updateInterval inside of WatermarkStrategy#withWatermarkAlignment method\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-24T05:51:11Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T01:19:23Z","closed_at":"2024-04-25T01:19:23Z","merged_at":"2024-04-25T01:19:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"09531994e3cde35ec159315389cf20396c8e21bd","assignee":{"login":"1996fanrui","id":38427477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI3NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38427477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui","html_url":"https://github.com/1996fanrui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"1996fanrui","id":38427477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI3NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38427477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui","html_url":"https://github.com/1996fanrui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1735762977,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzM1NzYyOTc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Core","name":"component=API/Core","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24706/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24706/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24706/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8477d66187cab057c035a03bf1b0007aa5282f6a","head":{"label":"elon-X:watermark-align","ref":"watermark-align","sha":"8477d66187cab057c035a03bf1b0007aa5282f6a","user":{"login":"elon-X","id":34712973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzEyOTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34712973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X","html_url":"https://github.com/elon-X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":790799496,"node_id":"R_kgDOLyKkiA","name":"flink","full_name":"elon-X/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"elon-X","id":34712973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzEyOTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34712973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X","html_url":"https://github.com/elon-X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elon-X/repos","events_ur

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the possible error because of hash collision in MiniBatchStreamingJoinOperator\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nCurrently for InputSideHasNoUniqueKeyBundle the data is stored inside HashMap where the hashCode is used as key. But there is no additional check after comparing the hash codes of different records. So this PR brings additional check for equals before folding the records.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded testInnerJoinWithNoUniqueKeyHashCollision to StreamingMiniBatchJoinOperatorTest which fails before change and success after\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR moves all functional interfaces under `org.apache.flink.util.function` from `flink-core` module to `flink-core-api` module. The reason is that the async state processing APIs under `flink-core-api` will depend on those interfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Moves all functional interfaces under `org.apache.flink.util.function` from `flink-core` module to `flink-core-api` module.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes,

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-29768, the result partition in the local input channel has been updated to support speculation. It is necessary to similarly update the result partition ID in the remote input channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Update the result partition ID in the remote input channel.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by added tests *testUpdateRemoteInputChannelWithNewPartitionId*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, MATCH_RECOGNIZE completely ignores the ORDER BY clause in batch mode: the events are processed in the order they come which makes no sense. This pull request adds proper events ordering in Pattern Recognition for batch.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fix events ordering in MATCH_RECOGNIZE in batch mode\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified with `org.apache.flink.table.planner.runtime.batch.sql.MatchRecognizeITCase`. Existing tests have been modified.\r\nA few new tests have been added - they are simiar to the ones in `org.apache.flink.table.planner.runtime.stream.sql.MatchRecognizeITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes,

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the error handling in StateFuture's callback, making the job fail when any exception exception occurs in StateFuture's callback.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add exception handling to the implementation class of `StateFuture`/\r\n- Wire the exception in `StateFuture`'s callback to `environment.failExternally`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added/updated tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- `AsyncExecutionControllerTest#testException`\r\n- `ContextStateFutureImplTest`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBackport to Flink 1.18 for https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24688#event-12553480360\r\n\r\n*When using sortBufferAccumulator, we should recycle the buffers to freeSegments before releasing the data buffer. The reason is that when getting buffers from the DataBuffer, it may require more buffers than the current quantity available in freeSegments. Consequently, to ensure adequate buffers from DataBuffer, the flushed and recycled buffers should also be added to freeSegments for reuse.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Reuse the recycled buffers before releasing data buffer for sort accumulator*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by added tests *SortBufferAccumulatorTest#testReuseRecycledBuffersWhenFlushDataBuffer*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBackport to Flink 1.19 for https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24688#event-12553480360\r\n\r\n*When using sortBufferAccumulator, we should recycle the buffers to freeSegments before releasing the data buffer. The reason is that when getting buffers from the DataBuffer, it may require more buffers than the current quantity available in freeSegments. Consequently, to ensure adequate buffers from DataBuffer, the flushed and recycled buffers should also be added to freeSegments for reuse.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Reuse the recycled buffers before releasing data buffer for sort accumulator*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by added tests *SortBufferAccumulatorTest#testReuseRecycledBuffersWhenFlushDataBuffer*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n①mvn clean package compilation, using IDEA to run unit tests may fail to build\r\n② https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.19/zh/docs/flinkdev/building/, the website is also mvn clean install, compile, I think both should stay the same\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe code [examples](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.19/docs/connectors/datastream/datagen/#rate-limiting) used in the documentation are incorrect (this code won't compile). Currently, they look like this:\r\n```java\r\nGeneratorFunction<Long, Long> generatorFunction = index -> index;\r\ndouble recordsPerSecond = 100;\r\n\r\nDataGeneratorSource<String> source =\r\n        new DataGeneratorSource<>(\r\n             generatorFunction,\r\n             Long.MAX_VALUE,\r\n             RateLimiterStrategy.perSecond(recordsPerSecond),\r\n             Types.STRING);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generator function returns `Long` but the `DataGeneratorSource` uses `String` and `Types.STRING`, so the types do not match, and the example code cannot be compiled.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe types used by the `DataGeneratorSource` are updated to match the return type of the generator function.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nHadoop whose version below 3.3.0 doesn't support reading and positionable reading  with ByteBuffer, which may cause compile error. \r\nSee https://dev.azure.com/apache-flink/apache-flink/_build/results?buildId=59012&view=logs&j=87489130-75dc-54e4-1f45-80c30aa367a3&t=73da6d75-f30d-5d5a-acbe-487a9dcff678&l=3630\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Remove support about reading and positionable reading  with ByteBuffer, and add TODO.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change could be verified by current CI.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*When using sortBufferAccumulator, we should recycle the buffers to freeSegments before releasing the data buffer. The reason is that when getting buffers from the DataBuffer, it may require more buffers than the current quantity available in freeSegments. Consequently, to ensure adequate buffers from DataBuffer, the flushed and recycled buffers should also be added to freeSegments for reuse.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Reuse the recycled buffers before releasing data buffer for sort accumulator*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by added tests *SortBufferAccumulatorTest#testReuseRecycledBuffersWhenFlushDataBuffer*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImprove the performance of hybrid shuffle when enable memory decoupling and meantime the parallelism is small.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Make the SortBufferAccumulator use more buffers when the parallelism is small\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA ForStStateBackend is introduced to leverage ForSt as state store for Flink.\r\n\r\nThis ticket includes:\r\n\r\n- Life cycle of ForSt, including initlization/closing\r\n- basic options, resource control, metrics like RocksDBStateBackend\r\n\r\nIt doesn't include the implementation of new AsyncKeyedStateBackend and Async State API which will be resolved in other PRs.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Support ForSt FlinkEnv\r\n- Introduce ForStStateBackend and ForStKeyedStateBackend\r\n- Support restoring and building ForSt\r\n- Introduce ResourceContainer for ForStStateBackend\r\n- Introduce Metrics for ForStStateBackend\r\n- Introduce ForSt related options\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added serveral Tests about configs, metrics, memory control, forst load\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

the ExecutionGraph to running implicitly starts periodic checkpoint triggering. This should only occur after the all initialization steps have occurred.\r\nThe existing code could leak the CheckpointCoordinator if '#handleExecutionGraphCreation' fails to 'tryToAssignSlots'; this eventually leads to a checkpoint being triggered for old ExecutionGraph for which the operator holders were not initialized yet, which causes an exception that crashes the JM.\r\n\r\n~~We now force this to happen in the `Executing` constructor, at which point all the initialization steps must already be complete, and we can be sure that the EG gets transitioned into a terminal state when an error occurs (implicitly disabling checkpointing again).~~\r\n\r\nWe now do this only after slots have been assigned, right before the transition into Executing. At that point we either transition into executing (where we can be sure we'll transition into a terminal state eventually) or fail hard if an error

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is a simple PR that wire the new introduced operators of DataStream V2 with the `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperator`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Introduce `AbstractAsyncStateUdfStreamOperator` that is nearly identical with `AbstractUdfStreamOperator`, but extends from `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperator`\r\n - Replace base class of `ProcessOperator` (v2) from `AbstractUdfStreamOperator` to `AbstractAsyncStateUdfStreamOperator`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework without any test coverage. More will be added when the whole state processing works.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-18T12:22:34Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T06:15:28Z","closed_at":"2024-04-25T06:15:28Z","merged_at":"2024-04-25T06:15:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"a87db9333d80f720b6ba58e73da17d3d788c16c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d205b6ca3820c22578c3bfea78cf09546801d030","head":{"label":"Zakelly:f35156","ref":"f35156","sha":"d205b6ca3820c22578c3bfea78cf09546801d030","user":{"login":"Zakelly","id":2986149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODYxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2986149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly","html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":263260000,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjMyNjAwMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"Zakelly/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Zakelly","id":2986149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODYxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2986149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly","html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly/flink","description":"Apache

bug fixed:\r\n     missing character '>' in line 257, between 'String' and '()'\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Has this request introduced new features? (yes / no) no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-18T10:08:51Z","updated_at":"2024-12-06T21:32:40Z","closed_at":"2024-12-06T21:32:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ac5ce6bd3d4f3376a14bfddbf2445ddb638e622","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24677/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24677/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24677/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ef29926a603bc02167158b83b8c705208018adce","head":{"label":"TobaccoProduct:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"ef29926a603bc02167158b83b8c705208018adce","user":{"login":"TobaccoProduct","id":124324264,"node_id":"U_kgDOB2kJqA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124324264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct","html_url":"https://github.com/TobaccoProduct","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":685789562,"node_id":"R_kgDOKOBReg","name":"flink","full_name":"TobaccoProduct/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TobaccoProduct","id":124324264,"node_id":"U_kgDOB2kJqA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124324264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct","html_url":"https://github.com/TobaccoProduct","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TobaccoProduct/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TobaccoProduct/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n This PR implements checkpoint drain in `AsyncExecutionController`, and wires it to `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperator/AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperatorV2`. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add `AsyncExecutionController#drainInflightRecords`\r\n  - Override `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperator/AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperatorV2#snapshotState()`. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n- `AsyncExecutionControllerTest#testInFlightRecordControl()`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes, checkpointing)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-18T04:54:25Z","updated_at":"2024-04-28T03:34:36Z","closed_at":"2024-04-22T03:01:28Z","merged_at":"2024-04-22T03:01:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"9336760ace73a0c84b949370eb773d71f5e3ac1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bbf3a0c1f988300683cb5c4d5892caefc01cc4af","head":{"label":"fredia:FLINK-35027","ref":"FLINK-35027","sha":"bbf3a0c1f988300683cb5c4d5892caefc01cc4af","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

constructor\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-35148\r\n\r\nInstantiationUtil#hasPublicNullaryConstructor checks whether the given class has a public nullary constructor. The implementation can be improved a bit: the `Modifier#isPublic` check within the for-loop can be skipped as the Class#getConstructors() only returns public constructors.\r\n\r\nWe can also add a negative unit test for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Skip the `Modifier#isPublic` check\r\n- Use Java stream\r\n- Add negative unit test\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `InstantiationUtilTest`. This change added a new negative test in that class.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-17T22:31:05Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T16:28:06Z","closed_at":"2024-04-24T10:01:23Z","merged_at":"2024-04-24T10:01:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"9cc649898d018ca87fa83ae9831ca9bee856f70b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1735762977,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzM1NzYyOTc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Core","name":"component=API/Core","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24675/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24675/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24675/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fc79b8051c60e2628b2098e82bc945f79b08a3d3","head":{"label":"liuml07:FLINK-35148","ref":"FLINK-35148","sha":"fc79b8051c60e2628b2098e82bc945f79b08a3d3","user":{"login":"liuml07","id":159186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07","html_url":"https://github.com/liuml07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":411886516,"node_id":"R_kgDOGIzjtA","name":"flink","full_name":"liuml07/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuml07","id":159186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07","html_url":"https://github.com/liuml07","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuml07/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuml07/flink","description":"Apache

This can be resolved by using `inputChannels` to get channel and the map key of inputChannels will not vary with the attempts.\r\nIn addition, using that map instead can also improve performance for large scale jobs because no extra maps are created.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Simplify AvailabilityNotifierImpl*\r\n  - *Remove useless method in AvailabilityNotifierI*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *HybridShuffleITCase*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nProvide a way to ingest http timeout configuration to gcs-cloud-storage library in use.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* exposed gs.http.connect-timeout and gs.http.read-timeout configuration.\r\n* Pluming http timeout configurations to gcs-cloud-storage client.\r\n* rebase and conflict fix of the original PR (https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23226) made by @singhravidutt. I have no rights to patch the original conflict\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as GSRecoverableWriterTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\nDependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\nThe public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @Public(Evolving):

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adapts timer firing to async state execution. The entrances are `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperator ` and `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperatorV2`,  the hot path without this feature is not affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce `InternalTimerServiceAsyncImpl`.\r\n- Add `InternalTimeServiceManager#getAsyncInternalTimerService` method.\r\n- Override `getInternalTimerService` of `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperator ` and `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperatorV2`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- `InternalTimerServiceAsyncImplTest`\r\n- `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperatorTest#testTimerServiceIsAsync`\r\n- - `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperatorV2Test#testTimerServiceIsAsync`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRefactor `AsyncSinkWriterThrottlingTest` to flush when reaching batch sizes without changing processing time. The changes of processing time are in fact not needed for this test and are causing flakiness due to reference of timer call back from external thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- refactored `AsyncSinkWriterThrottlingTest` to send all batch data without change in timer service.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers:no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRefactor `AsyncSinkWriterThrottlingTest` to flush when reaching batch sizes without changing processing time. The changes of processing time are in fact not needed for this test and are causing flakiness due to reference of timer call back from external thread.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- refactored `AsyncSinkWriterThrottlingTest` to send all batch data without change in timer service.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers:no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs part of the async execution model of disaggregated state management, this PR introduce async execution configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add async execution configurations in `ExecutionOptions`\r\n- Add related getter/setter in `ExecutionConfig`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- StreamExecutionEnvironmentTest#testAsyncExecutionConfiguration\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (docs/ JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-15T09:35:10Z","updated_at":"2024-04-28T02:33:37Z","closed_at":"2024-04-26T11:50:04Z","merged_at":"2024-04-26T11:50:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ff2ba43720e72d050b3cc1aac35db02698340e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24667/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24667/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24667/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/96b21e8371e28e80205c93f49fae95eba7379be0","head":{"label":"fredia:FLINK-35026","ref":"FLINK-35026","sha":"96b21e8371e28e80205c93f49fae95eba7379be0","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixs the problem of missing methed parameter annotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdd the parameter annotation of 'taskManagerResourceId' for the method 'ResourceManagerGateway.sendSlotReport'.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):(no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers:(no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):(no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?(no)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-15T08:40:56Z","updated_at":"2024-04-16T01:34:39Z","closed_at":"2024-04-16T01:34:39Z","merged_at":"2024-04-16T01:34:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"9ae9c1463d87da2fa0e4dd58ee6fd10d38cda6bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24666/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24666/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24666/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b0404b8f421f5920d958ff4ad3fdad170d4f56e4","head":{"label":"chenyu0513:branch-hotfix-0415","ref":"branch-hotfix-0415","sha":"b0404b8f421f5920d958ff4ad3fdad170d4f56e4","user":{"login":"chenyu0513","id":119398199,"node_id":"U_kgDOBx3fNw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119398199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513","html_url":"https://github.com/chenyu0513","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":631446977,"node_id":"R_kgDOJaMdwQ","name":"flink","full_name":"chenyu0513/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenyu0513","id":119398199,"node_id":"U_kgDOBx3fNw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119398199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513","html_url":"https://github.com/chenyu0513","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenyu0513/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenyu0513/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRename flink-connector-datagen-test module folder to flink-connector-datagen-tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/95013770/bd57c21d-2e06-4d22-ae48-2ef0983fbca6)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-15T08:25:41Z","updated_at":"2024-04-15T11:31:57Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fedce03e26e8f925d2fa5297f8fda9ca6c06d151","head":{"label":"xleoken:35107","ref":"35107","sha":"fedce03e26e8f925d2fa5297f8fda9ca6c06d151","user":{"login":"xleoken","id":95013770,"node_id":"U_kgDOBanLig","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95013770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken","html_url":"https://github.com/xleoken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":459892598,"node_id":"R_kgDOG2lndg","name":"flink","full_name":"xleoken/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xleoken","id":95013770,"node_id":"U_kgDOBanLig","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95013770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken","html_url":"https://github.com/xleoken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xleoken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xleoken/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-35103\r\n\r\nCurrently, whenever we have flink failures, we need to manually do the triaging by looking into the flink logs even for the initial analysis. It would have been better, if the user/admin directly gets the initial failure information even before looking into the logs.\r\n\r\nTo address this, we've developed a comprehensive solution via a plugin aimed at helping fetch the Flink failures, ensuring critical data is preserved for subsequent analysis and action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Kubernetes environments, troubleshooting pod failures can be challenging without checking the pod/flink logs. Fortunately, Kubernetes offers a robust mechanism to enhance debugging capabilities by leveraging the /dev/termination-log file.\r\n\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/determine-reason-pod-failure/\r\n\r\nBy writing failure information to this log, Kubernetes automatically incorporates it into the container status, providing administrators and developers with valuable insights into the root cause of failures.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur solution capitalizes on this Kubernetes feature to seamlessly integrate Flink failure reporting within the container ecosystem. Whenever a Flink encounters an issue, our plugin dynamically captures and logs the pertinent failure information into the /dev/termination-log file. This ensures that Kubernetes recognizes and propagates the failure status throughout the container ecosystem, enabling efficient monitoring and response mechanisms.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging Kubernetes' native functionality in this manner, our plugin ensures that Flink failure incidents are promptly identified and reflected in the pod status. This technical integration streamlines the debugging process, empowering operators to swiftly diagnose and address issues, thereby minimizing downtime and maximizing system reliability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn-order to make this plugin generic, by default it doesn't do any action.  We can configure this by using\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdded a new plugin. \r\nBy default, it does not do anything. When its configured via the flink-conf, to enable K8STerminationLog, it writes to /dev/termination-log file.\r\n```\r\nexternal.log.factory.class : org.apache.flink.externalresource.log.K8SSupportTerminationLog\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will be present in the plugins directory\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/85697049/ad129570-c175-447e-aafc-608d6b51e9c2)\r\n\r\nThe pod status would show the error message like below if there are any flink issues :\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/85697049/bcf74b1f-2a96-4448-9a0f-ace0a2da0827)\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers, can add their own implementation if needed in the future to support other use cases for flink on Yarn and standalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce AsyncKeyedStateBackend which supports to create StateExecutor\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce a new interface called AsyncKeyedStateBackend \r\n- Introduce a new method for StateBackend to create AsyncKeyedStateBackend\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change modified AsyncExecutionControllerTest to verify the new added interface.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFixes broken deserialization of the `raw` format.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe existing `reuse` attribute is returned by the `deserialize()` method in `RawFormatDeserializationSchema`. The attribute is successively modified during deserialization but since it's returned by reference in the method, all the returned deserializations refer to a single value. This change removes the attributes and instead constructs the returned value in the `deserialize()` method inside the method itself, thus avoiding overwrites.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n**Existing Behavior**\r\n1. Create a test file with the content:\r\n```\r\nline 1\r\nline 2\r\nline3\r\n```\r\n2. Run\r\n```SQL\r\nCREATE TABLE MyRawTable (\r\n`doc` string,\r\n) WITH (\r\n'path' = 'file:///path/to/data',\r\n'format' = 'raw',\r\n'connector' = 'filesystem'\r\n);\r\n```\r\n3. Check inserted values\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT * FROM MyRawTable;\r\n```\r\n```\r\ndoc\r\n-----\r\nline 3\r\nline 3\r\nline 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After the Change**\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT * FROM MyRawTable;\r\n```\r\n```\r\ndoc\r\n-----\r\nline 1\r\nline 2\r\nline 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n As part of the async execution model of disaggregated state management, this PR gives the basic definition of `StreamingOperator` integrated with async execution.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy behind this PR is **we are trying NOT to invade the previous code path**. The most strict thing is that **it MUST NOT affect any _hot path_ without this feature**.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the type parameter of record around `AsyncExecutionController` is erased, since the stream operator does not have the knowledge of record type, and the `AEC` does not need it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Erase the type parameter of record around `AsyncExecutionController` \r\n - Define the `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperator` and `AbstractAsyncStateStreamOperatorV2` corresponding to the `AbstracStreamOperator` and `AbstracStreamOperatorV2` respectively.\r\n - Wire the record processing logic with new introduced abstract stream operators in `RecordProcessorUtils`.\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change around `AEC` is already covered by existing tests. Basic UTs for new operators are added.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently the `lastRecordAttributes1` and `lastRecordAttributes2` in the `AbstractStreamOperator` are transient. The two fields will be null when it is deserialized in TaskManager, which may cause an NPE.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, we will initialize the two fields in the `setup` method.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n-  Initialize the two fields in the `setup` method.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Integration test is added

However, there seems to be an oddly phrased error message that looks like it might have been written incorrectly.\r\n\r\nThe error message reads: \"The reporter configuration of '{}' configures the reporter class, which is no a no longer supported approach to configure reporters.\" + \" Please configure a factory class instead:\"\r\n\r\nI believe the correct phrasing should be: \"The reporter configuration of '{}' configures the reporter class, which is a no longer supported approach to configure reporters.\" + \" Please configure a factory class instead:\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that the words \"no a\" were accidentally added, making the sentence grammatically incorrect and potentially confusing for users.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix incorrect warning msg in JM log when use metric reporter\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nJust warning log print\r\n\r\nThe error message reads: \"The reporter configuration of '{}' configures the reporter class, which is no a no longer supported approach to configure reporters.\" + \" Please configure a factory class instead:\"\r\nI believe the correct phrasing should be: \"The reporter configuration of '{}' configures the reporter class, which is a no longer supported approach to configure reporters.\" + \" Please configure a factory class instead:\"\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/20400582/14b6c38d-933e-4517-a2f8-386967c8e553)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNo need to test\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMigrate current file merging of channel state snapshot into the unify file merging framework.\r\nThis PR only focuses on the snapshot/writing part.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Introduce `UnifyMergingChannelStateWriteRequestDispatcher` which construct a ` ChannelStateCheckpointWriter` that uses unified file merging mechanism to write channel state.\r\n- Update `ChannelStateWriteRequestExecutorFactory#getOrCreateExecutor` , different ways to merge small files can be chosen here.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n- `ChannelStateWriteRequestDispatcherTest`\r\n- `ChannelStateWriteRequestExecutorFactoryTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (checkpointing)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? ( no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-11T12:44:44Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T07:35:30Z","closed_at":"2024-05-09T07:35:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55ea65034fe21f2097d0920c1802c73c86e7254d","assignee":{"login":"1996fanrui","id":38427477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI3NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38427477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui","html_url":"https://github.com/1996fanrui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"1996fanrui","id":38427477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDI3NDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38427477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui","html_url":"https://github.com/1996fanrui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1996fanrui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ab955346fc56db7f186523152d9c799fac3cc745","head":{"label":"fredia:FLINK-32084","ref":"FLINK-32084","sha":"ab955346fc56db7f186523152d9c799fac3cc745","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce Internal State to delegates all state requests to AEC.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce new StateDescriptor for Async State API\r\n  - Introduce InternalKvState for Async State API\r\n  - Implement Async Value State\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added StateDescriptorTest\r\n- Modified existed AsyncExecutionControllerTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-11T09:47:37Z","updated_at":"2024-04-17T14:32:56Z","closed_at":"2024-04-17T14:32:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21a06118873adc50a726f09228013b86c5e611cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e6e9ebefe1b8bb0bbaa32ebadacd9999e036e821","head":{"label":"masteryhx:FLINK-34987","ref":"FLINK-34987","sha":"e6e9ebefe1b8bb0bbaa32ebadacd9999e036e821","user":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":436096625,"node_id":"R_kgDOGf5OcQ","name":"flink","full_name":"masteryhx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA bit reasoning for the change\r\n\r\nThe reason is that since 1.28.0 ( [CALCITE-4787](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4787) - Move core to use Immutables instead of ImmutableBeans ) Calcite started to use Immutables (https://immutables.github.io/) and since 1.29.0 removed ImmutableBeans ( [CALCITE-4839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4839) - Remove remnants of ImmutableBeans post 1.28 release ). All rule configuration related api which is not Immutables based is marked as deprecated. Since Immutables implies code generation while java compilation it is seems impossible to use for rules in Scala code.\r\n\r\nThe PR migrates TwoStageOptimizedAggregateRule to java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA bit reasoning for the change\r\n\r\nThe reason is that since 1.28.0 ( [CALCITE-4787](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4787) - Move core to use Immutables instead of ImmutableBeans ) Calcite started to use Immutables (https://immutables.github.io/) and since 1.29.0 removed ImmutableBeans ( [CALCITE-4839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4839) - Remove remnants of ImmutableBeans post 1.28 release ). All rule configuration related api which is not Immutables based is marked as deprecated. Since Immutables implies code generation while java compilation it is seems impossible to use for rules in Scala code.\r\n\r\nThe PR migrates RewriteMultiJoinConditionRule to java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is a sub-task of FLIP-306. The life-cycle maintenance of underlying files in file merging manager needs the info of state handle reusing. This PR provide a callback for state handle reusing in `CheckpointStreamFactory` and integrate this with RocksDBKeyedStateBackend.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Add interface `reusePreviousStateHandle` in `CheckpointStreamFactory`, implement this in `FsMergingCheckpointStorageLocation`\r\n - Call `reusePreviousStateHandle` during uploading.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA bit reasoning for the change\r\n\r\nThe reason is that since 1.28.0 ( [CALCITE-4787](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4787) - Move core to use Immutables instead of ImmutableBeans ) Calcite started to use Immutables (https://immutables.github.io/) and since 1.29.0 removed ImmutableBeans ( [CALCITE-4839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4839) - Remove remnants of ImmutableBeans post 1.28 release ).

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor JDK 17+, some configuration is necessary to use the Datastream V2 (FLINK-34548 and FLIP-409).  This was added to `surefire.module.config` for most of the necessary tests.  The `flink-yarn-tests` spawn new processes (notably JobManager) which should take into account the same configuration as other surefire tests.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Copy the `surefire.module.config` property into the `env.java.opts.all` Flink configuration when running a new test cluster.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change fixes an existing test: `YARNApplicationITCase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API,

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs described in https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/22669#issuecomment-1593370772, It is best for the materialization Interval to be greater than checkpoint interval, this PR increases the materialization Interval of ChangelogRecoveryITCase#testMaterialization to work around the unstable test.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Increase the materialization Interval of ChangelogRecoveryITCase#testMaterialization\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests: ChangelogRecoveryITCase#testMaterialization.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe PR aims to add valid uniqueKeys and uniqueKeys candidates for windows with ROW_NUMBER.  The candidates are pairs of partition by keys and field of ROW_NUMBER for each window group.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add `getUniqueKeysOfWindowGroup` function to resolve uniqueKeys candidates for window group who contains ROW_NUMBER.*\r\n  - *Change uniqueKeys/UpsertKeys/ColumnUniqueness inference logic for relNodes of `Window`, `BatchPhysicalOverAggregate` and `StreamPhysicalOverAggregate types`.*\r\n  - *Test the logic in corresponding tests, like `FlinkRelMdColumnUniquenessTest`*\r\n  - *Fix wrong initialization of window groups in `FlinkRelMdHandlerTestBase`.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests in `FlinkRelMdColumnUniquenessTest`, `FlinkRelMdUniqueKeysTest` and `FlinkRelMdUpsertKeysTest` to check if partition by keys and field of ROW_NUMBER are candidates.  *\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAfter FLINK-34516, the `org.apache.flink.streaming.api.CheckpointingMode` has been moved to `org.apache.flink.core.execution.CheckpointingMode`. It introduced a breaking change to connector testing framework as well as to externalized connector repos by mistake. This PR fix this by providing methods with old signatures.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Provide methods with old signatures in `TestingSinkSettings` and `TestingSourceSettings`\r\n- Support old `CheckpointingMode` in annotation `TestSemantics`, add fallback logic in `ConnectorTestingExtension`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change can be verified manually in downstream projects, such as the kafka connector.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA bit reasoning for the change\r\n\r\nThe reason is that since 1.28.0 ( [CALCITE-4787](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4787) - Move core to use Immutables instead of ImmutableBeans ) Calcite started to use Immutables (https://immutables.github.io/) and since 1.29.0 removed ImmutableBeans ( [CALCITE-4839](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4839) - Remove remnants of ImmutableBeans post 1.28 release ). All rule configuration related api which is not Immutables based is marked as deprecated. Since Immutables implies code generation while java compilation it is seems impossible to use for rules in Scala code.\r\n\r\nThe PR migrates TemporalJoinRewriteWithUniqueKeyRule to java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

The serializers and de-serializers have already been defined previously.\r\n\r\n`Set` is another common Java collection type, but there's no built-in serializer for it yet (`MultiSetTypeInformation` utilizes `MapSerializer` underneath, but it could be more efficient for common `Set`), we can add support for it in a following PR.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests that validates maps and lists are serialized using the built-in serializer instead of Kyro.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know) \r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-08T13:26:22Z","updated_at":"2024-05-27T02:47:37Z","closed_at":"2024-05-27T02:02:14Z","merged_at":"2024-05-27T02:02:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"f860631c523c1d446c0d01046f0fbe6055174dc6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24634/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24634/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24634/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e26a8fe6647a26d94e6de128ca10704e7404eada","head":{"label":"X-czh:FLINK-34123","ref":"FLINK-34123","sha":"e26a8fe6647a26d94e6de128ca10704e7404eada","user":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439573734,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjNc5g","name":"flink","full_name":"X-czh/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"X-czh","id":22020529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDIwNTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22020529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh","html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/X-czh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/X-czh/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs described in FLIP-427, ForStFileSystem is introduced to support reading and writing with ByteBuffer, which will bridge between ForSt FileSystem and Flink FileSystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduce ForStFlinkFileSystem to delegate Flink FileSystem\r\n- ForStFlinkFileSystem supports reading and writing with ByteBuffer\r\n- Introduce input stream pool and PositionedReadable to improve the performance of readFully\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by ForStFlinkFileSystemTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA simple work to introduce a new module for ForStStateBackend, then several subsequent PR e.g. ForStFileSystem, Implementation of Async API, ForStStateBackend could be commited/reviewed in parallel based on it.\r\nSee FLIP-427 for more details.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Init flink-statebackend-forst module with necessary dependencies\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial work to introduce a new module without tests coverage. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?
