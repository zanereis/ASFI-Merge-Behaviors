of the main advantages of using AWS Secrets Manager is its ability to automatically create secrets of RDS databases and Redshift databases. Those secrets consist of several keys with their values, i.e user, pass, etc. Also, it is normal to store API Keys, sftp, or whatever using different values, as shown in the picture below:\r\n![Captura de pantalla 2020-05-22 a las 10 41 07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11339132/82648933-c23ac100-9c18-11ea-9f7c-6a36d0333bbe.png)\r\n\r\nWith the current code, all the keys and values obtained from a secret are stored in the schema attribute of the conn object, unless you have just one key with the conn_uri in the value. Thus, the current situation is forcing to use Secrets Manager in a way it is not intended to.\r\n\r\nWith this proposed modification, you can use AWS Secrets Manager using keys and values and have some kind of freedom to choose different words for each key to make the get_conn work.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides

support providing custom Variable implementation.\r\n\r\nInspired by https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/8560, this PR makes `Variable` implementation pluggable as well. In some cases, we may want to override the default `Variable` implementations:\r\n- Store variable using a different backend than the airflow metastore.\r\n- During DAG migration from an old Airflow cluster to new Airflow cluster, we may want to fallback to the old airflow cluster if variable does not exist in the new airflow cluster. We may also want to make DAGs on the old cluster double writing to the new cluster as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above

of our tests (when I was looking at another change) were using the\nProcessorAgent to run and test the behaviour of our ProcessorManager in\ncertain cases. Having that extra process in the middle is not critical\nfor the tests, and makes it harder to debug the problem when if\nsomething breaks.\n\n(We already test the Agent elsewhere.)\n\nTo make this possible I have made a small refactor to the loop of\nDagFileProcessorManager (to give us a method we can call in tests that\ndoesn't do `os.setsid`).\n\n\n---\nMake sure to mark the boxes below

PR is to prevents all downstream tasks from being forcibly skipped when setting `soft_fail=True`.  \r\n\r\nIn the current specification, the downstream task will show up as skipped because its trigger_rule is set to all_success by default and skipped tasks will cascade through all_success. Therefore, It is unlikely that this change will affect the existing behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Issue link**\r\n#8696 \r\n>Downstream tasks with trigger_rule all_success (i.e. the default) should be skipped because of TriggerRuleDep. Tasks that are none_failed or one_success etc should not be skipped unconditionally by the soft_fail sensor.\r\n\r\n**Code quality**\r\nflake8 \r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before

preparing backport relases I found that rabbitmq was not\r\nincluded in the \"devel_ci\" extras. It turned out that librabbitmq was\r\nnot installing in python3.7 and the reason it turned out to be\r\nthat librabbitmq is not maintained for 2 years already and it\r\nhas been replaced by py-amqp library. The pythhon py-amqp\r\nlibrary has been improved using cython compilation, so it\r\nbecame production ready and librabbitmq has been abandoned.\r\n\r\nWe are switching to the py-amqp library here and

support task instance mutation before each execution.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only way to apply cluster-wide mutations to tasks is by defining `policy` in `airflow_local_setting`. However, `policy` is applied to `task` (not `task_instance` and the descriptions and docs are wrong) right after the DAG is loaded. And you will not be able to change the task after that.\r\n\r\nTherefore a hook is added to support mutating the task instance before each execution (in case there is a retry). For example, you can re-route the task to execute in a different queue during retries.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6523 a validation was added to `KubernetesPodOperator` that verifies the provided `name` conforms to the maximum number of characters for _Kubernetes_ pods.\r\n\r\nThe provided character limit in such PR is not correct as it's using the maximum number of characters for a _Kubernetes_ label, which is `63`, instead of the maximum number of characters for _Kubernetes_ name, which is `253` [1].\r\n\r\nHowever, the char limit set in this module depends on the implementation of `airflow.kubernetes.pod_generator.PodGenerator`. Upon the [_commit_ this PR is based](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/f410d64de56e3a2c9f3f0bec1f25aa4ad8fc815d/airflow/kubernetes/pod_generator.py#L473), whatever the length of the given name, such name will be shortened to conform to the norm (`253` characters). In the referenced _commit_ an additional `33` characters are added (`-` + `32` random), which in turns means that **this should validate that the name is no longer that `220` characters** (the value proposed).\r\n\r\nBear also in mind that current v.10.10 does not have the implementation of the [_commit_ mentioned](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/f410d64de56e3a2c9f3f0bec1f25aa4ad8fc815d/airflow/kubernetes/pod_generator.py#L473) but a [different one](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/185cab52aee657eb8a95b97cf28bb87646650299/airflow/contrib/kubernetes/pod_generator.py#L167) where the name is not shortened but directly concatenated to another `9` characters (`-` + 8 random) and thus the name this limit could be set to `244` (instead of the `220` characters proposed).\r\n\r\n[1] [Identifiers and Names in

PR fixes https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8810.\r\n\r\n`httplib2` recently made changes to redirect / follow 308 status code. This conflicts with some Google Drive APIs which are using 308 for [resumable uploads](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/manage-uploads#resumable). This PR replicates the [google-api-python-client fix](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/pull/813) that addresses the exact same issue.\r\n\r\nFor backward compatibility, I decided against reusing [build_http](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/v1.8.0/googleapiclient/http.py#L1874) from `googleapiclient.http` since it will introduce a default timeout of 60s if no timeout was set previously.\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\n\r\nAfter discussing with @mik-laj, agreed that using `build_http` is a better approach.

debugging another test I noticed that the scheduler was spending a\r\nlong time waiting for a \"simple\" dag to be parsed. But upon closer\r\ninspection the parsing process itself was done in a few milliseconds,\r\nbut we just weren't harvesting the results in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\nThis change uses the `sentinel` attribute of multiprocessing.Connection\r\n(added in Python 3.3) to be able to wait for all the processes, so that\r\nas soon as one has finished we get woken up and can immediately harvest\r\nand pass on the parsed dags.\r\n\r\nThis makes test_scheduler_job.py about twice as quick, and also reduces\r\nthe time the scheduler spends between tasks .\r\n\r\nIn real work loads, or where there are lots of dags this likely won't\r\nequate to much such a huge speed up, but for our (synthetic) elastic\r\nperformance test dag.\r\n\r\nThese were the timings for the dag to run all the tasks in a

component was mentioned](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8202#issuecomment-626277797) and to specify it in the docs; can you elaborate? \r\n  - This will most likely be a follow-up commit(s) because I did not mention this at all in this initial version if the PR\r\n- I tried to be thorough but I may have missed some better kinds of example use cases, please call them out if you can think of any.\r\n- General arrangement is: Java, Python, Templated. Did this categorization based on the operators available - please let me know if that is intuitive or if you have other ideas.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR:

`test_scheduler_reschedule` method fails when creating processes in `spawn` mode, which is the default mode for Python 3.8 on MacOS. \r\n\r\n`test_scheduler_reschedule` depends on `mock.patch()` decorators around the `.do_schedule()` method in the parent process to mock `DagBag` objects in the child process. Since spawn mode limits the amount of parent state accessible within the child process, `DagBag` is not properly mocked in the new process, causing the test to fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR forces the test to use `fork` instead of `spawn` when creating a child process, allowing the mocks to work as intended.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description

PR adds a default helm chart for Airflow. This chart is based on the one we use at Astronomer to manage hundreds of production deployments.\r\n\r\nThe chart has been cleaned up to remove any references to the Astronomer platform or anything specific to the surrounding infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe `bin` directory contains some scripts to help run this chart locally or in CI using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/), as well as packaging and releasing it to a helm repository. The scripts reference the Astronomer helm repo right now, but I figured we could use it as a starting point and tweak these scripts, or remove them completely to fit into how we want to manage this going forward.

the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1056\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1156\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3369\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6577\r\n\r\nIf you create a DAG with catchup=False, when it is un-paused, it creates 2 dag runs. One for the most recent scheduled interval (expected) and one for the interval before that (unexpected).\r\n\r\n**Sample DAG**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator\r\n\r\ndag = DAG(\r\n    dag_id='DummyTest',\r\n    start_date=datetime(2018,1,1),\r\n    catchup=False\r\n)\r\n\r\ndo = DummyOperator(\r\n    task_id='dummy_task',\r\n    dag=dag\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Result**:\r\n\r\n2 DAG runs are created. 2018-11-18 and 108-11-17\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/81360377-8f021900-90d3-11ea-9191-ee48092ee980.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Result**:\r\n\r\nOnly 1 DAG run should have been created (2018-11-18)\r\n\r\n**Cause**:\r\nThis only occurs when using a **timedelta** as Schedule Interval (not when using Cron expression or Cron preset).\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the following block of code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/6e4f5fa66ebe2d8252829c67e79f895fa5029b5a/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L578-L595\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before
