What is this PR for?\r\nRecord the `INTERPRETER_RUN_COMMAND` execution log in the interpreter.sh file. Can help find the reason why the startup interpreter failed to execute. \r\nEspecially in the container environment, it can play a relatively large role. When creating an interpreter process in the container, if it fails, you can use this log to re-execute and check the problem.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4189\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n[CI Pass](https://travis-ci.org/liuxunorg/zeppelin/builds/553071915) \r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-02T05:43:41Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T06:35:55Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d260c54d45683ad06887bd7f8cc958138d17979","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3391/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3391/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3391/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/6e17797779ec3be999a8b7f7ec9c5c1f002a1be7","head":{"label":"xunliu:ZEPPELIN-4189","ref":"ZEPPELIN-4189","sha":"6e17797779ec3be999a8b7f7ec9c5c1f002a1be7","user":{"login":"xunliu","id":3677382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzczODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3677382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu","html_url":"https://github.com/xunliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144678681,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ2Nzg2ODE=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"xunliu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xunliu","id":3677382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzczODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3677382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu","html_url":"https://github.com/xunliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xunliu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n1. **ClusterInterpreterLauncher can not listen cluster events**\r\nIn Cluster mode, The `ClusterInterpreterLauncher` needs to listen for cluster events, Accept requests from other zeppelin servers to create interpreter processes.\r\nSince the `ClusterInterpreterLauncher` is lazy, dynamically generated, So in cluster mode, when the zeppelin service starts, Create a `ClusterInterpreterLauncher` object, This allows the `ClusterInterpreterLauncher` to listen for cluster events.\r\n\r\n2. **Replace `RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess` with `ClusterInterpreterProcess` for local interpreter process creation**\r\nBecause in cluster mode, `RemoteInterpreterServer` performs service discovery by registering thrift's `ip` and `port` into the cluster metadata, not through the thrift interface `callback`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4209\r\n\r\n### How

What is this PR for?\r\nZeppelin service runs on local server. zeppelin is able to run the interpreter in the docker container, Isolating the operating environment of the interpreter through the docker container. Zeppelin can be easily used without having to install python, spark, etc. on the local node.\r\n\r\nDesign Doc : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ESQEHmGlw4kaXkK5Hn2AOJYBLWDZRU9shB3WHuGV-CM/edit\r\n\r\n#### Key benefits are\r\n1. Interpreter environment isolating\r\n2. Not need to install `python lib`, `spark binary package`, etc. environment on the local node\r\n3. Docker does not need to pre-install zeppelin binary package, Automatically upload local zeppelin interpreter lib files to the container\r\n4. Automatically upload local configuration files (such as `spark-conf`, `hadoop-conf-dir`, `keytab file`, ...) to the container, so that the running environment in the container is exactly the same as the local.\r\n5. Zeppelin server runs locally, making it easier to manage and maintain\r\n6. Support zeppelin all interpreter\r\n7.

What is this PR for?\r\nUpon raising the concern (ZEPPELIN-3860), we were suggested to upgrade the zeppelin service from 0.7.3 to 0.8.0 version. With the current zeppelin version i.e 0.8.0 the frequency of broken pipe error has gone up.\r\n\r\nWhen connecting to a database through a database connection pool, If there is no sql operation for a long time, The database connection pool will actively close this connection. The connection between the client and the database is broken.\r\n\r\nSo by increasing\r\n```\r\npoolableConnectionFactory.setValidationQuery(\"show databases\");\r\n```\r\nPeriodically call the `show databases` statement, Keep the connection to the database.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3946\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nThe user passed the actual test, Verification solves this problem.\r\n[CI Pass](https://travis-ci.org/liuxunorg/zeppelin/builds/539529259)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?  no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-31T15:10:34Z","updated_at":"2019-06-04T01:24:04Z","closed_at":"2019-06-04T01:24:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d5a3665abe56e206d876617d9ceedd5094ac89a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3374/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3374/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3374/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/f2877fd4bfe6e3e79b4c488c866e04f99939e7b8","head":{"label":"xunliu:ZEPPELIN-3946","ref":"ZEPPELIN-3946","sha":"f2877fd4bfe6e3e79b4c488c866e04f99939e7b8","user":{"login":"xunliu","id":3677382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzczODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3677382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu","html_url":"https://github.com/xunliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144678681,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ2Nzg2ODE=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"xunliu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xunliu","id":3677382,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzczODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3677382?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu","html_url":"https://github.com/xunliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xunliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xunliu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nFixes issue where after refreshing a note's page the revision controls in the navigation bar are hidden since listConfigurations is only requested in the navbar controller after a loginSuccess broadcast.\r\nThis currently works sometimes because another controller (note-import) sends a listConfigurations request when it is loaded and navbar controller is sometimes loaded by the time the response arrives, but I can reproduce it easily using Firefox (gif attached to Jira issue).\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4144](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4144)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nAdded unit and e2e tests to make sure listConfigurations is called and controls are visible.\r\nSeems to me like the issue is easier to reproduce using Firefox. Was able to do so using the official 0.8.1 docker image.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-14T05:37:26Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T06:35:55Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c468ba158f17d3b9adedfc6884fe65ef6faaafe4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3363/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3363/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3363/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/8858e65dd8c52773ddc46f90b01de969f54f33b8","head":{"label":"florpor:ZEPPELIN-4144","ref":"ZEPPELIN-4144","sha":"8858e65dd8c52773ddc46f90b01de969f54f33b8","user":{"login":"florpor","id":1809093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDkwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1809093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor","html_url":"https://github.com/florpor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":186178080,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODYxNzgwODA=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"florpor/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"florpor","id":1809093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDkwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1809093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor","html_url":"https://github.com/florpor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/florpor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/florpor/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

PR.\r\nThis PR is work in progress.\r\n\r\n### How to run \r\n\r\n1. Prepare kubernetes cluster\r\n2. Prepare persistentVolumeClaim with name 'task-context-volume-claim' in your kubernetes cluster\r\n3. Build Zeppelin docker image (follow instructions [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/quickstart/kubernetes.md)\r\n4. Deploy api router by running `kubectl apply -f k8s/serving-api-router/serving-api-router.yaml`\r\n5. Start Zeppelin on Kubernetes by running `kubectl apply -f k8s/zeppelin-server.yaml`\r\n6. Port forward to the api router (e.g. `kubectl port-forward <zeppelin-serving-api-router pod name> 8080:80`) and browse `localhost:8080`\r\n\r\n *Note: This branch does not include front-end implementation. To try with front-end, checkout [this branch](https://github.com/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin/pull/9).\r\n\r\n### Summary of changes\r\nTo be updated\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3994\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* First time?

Sometimes it is very hard to diagnose if the process is failed to launch or some error happens during its lifecycle. This PR introduce ProcessLauncher to encapsulate process launch. ProcessLauncher will do most of the process launching stuff but also allow for customization. E.g. how to check the process is started properly. And when error happens, ProcessLauncher will capture the necessary error output for further diagnose. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[ Improvement | Refactoring]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4066\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Ci pass\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nFix CreateNote() function throw Note existed IOException caused travis to fail.\r\nWhen using trivis-ci, The exception will be triggered randomly.\r\n\r\n#### **Cause Analysis:**\r\n1. Recently, Notebook added a new one in createNote() to determine if the note name already exists. If it exists, an exception is thrown.\r\n2. In the test case, the code\r\nTestUtils.getInstance(Notebook.class) creates a global single instance object.\r\n\r\n3. Program processing flow\r\n    + TestUtils.getInstance(Notebook.class).createNote(\"note1\", anonymous);\r\n    + After executing some test code, eg: spark, python, etc\r\n    + TestUtils.getInstance(Notebook.class).removeNote(note.getId(), anonymous);\r\n    + Delete this note.\r\n    + If the spark, python exception is thrown before removeNote, then the note still exists.

What is this PR for?\r\nThe interpreter is executed according to the paragraph. Click the run button in the paragraph, and only the code content in the current paragraph can be obtained in the interpreter process.\r\n\r\nTo pass the Dashboard paragraph in the submarine interpreter, you need to submit all the code content in this note to tensorflow for execution.\r\n\r\nSo, I think need to get the note data in sever through `RemoteInterpreterEventServer` in the interpreter process.\r\n\r\nI implemented two other methods, so that the interpreter can get the note in the server, the actual running effect is not the best solution.\r\n\r\n**1) By having the interpreter directly access the external storage of the note repository, such as HDFS, S3.**\r\n\r\n1. But this limits the need to store notes in an external storage system.\r\n2. In hdfs with kerberos authentication system enabled, not all users can access the note folder.\r\n\r\n**2) Get the note from the server from the REST client in the interpreter.**\r\n\r\n1. Need to let zeppelin/api/notes intercept in shrio.ini.\r\n2. Or let the interpreter access the REST interface of the server through the user and password, but it is not safe.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in [JIRA-4018](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4018) Workflow and orchestration, it is also necessary to query all the notes and paragraphs of the user in the workflow paragraph for the execution of the note.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4019\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nShellInterpreter::internalInterpret(String cmd, InterpreterContext contextInterpreter)\r\n```\r\nString noteJson = contextInterpreter.getIntpEventClient().getNoteFromServer(\r\n    cmd,\r\n    contextInterpreter.getAuthenticationInfo(), true);\r\nif (null != noteJson) {\r\n  LOGGER.info(noteJson);\r\n  return new InterpreterResult(Code.SUCCESS, noteJson);\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn new InterpreterResult(Code.ERROR, \"can not get note :\" + cmd);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![getnotefromserver](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3677382/53401050-088b7b00-39ea-11e9-9f12-caee4d194fac.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n[CI pass](https://travis-ci.org/liuxunorg/zeppelin/builds/498581356)\r\n\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?
