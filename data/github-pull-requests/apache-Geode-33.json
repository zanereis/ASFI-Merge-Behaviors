PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE is described here: https://redis.io/topics/pubsub\r\n\r\nThis implementation introduces 3 new command classes to support this:\r\n`SubscribeExecutor`, `PublishExecutor` and `UnsubscribeExecutor`. At a high\r\nlevel, the flow is as follows:\r\n- A Redis client issues a SUBSCRIBE command. The server maintains a list of\r\n  subscribed clients and associate channel(s) in the `Subscribers` class. A\r\n  subscribed `Client` uses Netty's notion of a `uniqueID` to identify itself\r\n  uniquely.\r\n- When a client PUBLISHes a message on a channel, the publish 'event' uses an\r\n  `onMembers` function call to distribute the channel/message to all members.\r\n  Each member then publishes the message to any `Client`s registered on the\r\n  channel.\r\n\r\nPoints to note:\r\nRedis pub/sub is not HA. i.e. A subscriber only receives those messages\r\npublished after it has successfully subscribed. If the client is disconnected\r\nand reconnects, it will not receive messages published during the disconnect\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nWhen clients subscribe, an open connection is established to the server and the\r\nclient blocks waiting for messages.\r\n\r\nThis implementation does not require messages to be published on the same\r\nserver to which the clients, executing subscribe, are connected since the\r\npublished message is distributed to all servers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Jens Deppe <jdeppe@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Prasath Durairaj <vdurairaj@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Murtuza Boxwala <mboxwala@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Sarah Abbey <sabbey@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: John Hutchison <jhutchison@pivotal.io>\r\nCo-authored-by: Ray Ingles <ringles@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

are executed on individual entries whenever an event is triggered\r\nfor them and the execution context is always cleared before the actual\r\nevaluation, thus using an internal cache to keep already

the query engine to avoid using the internal cache for\r\n  already authorized methods when the context belongs to a CQ.\r\n- Avoid the creation and concatenation of unnecessary Strings, using\r\n

ArchUnit class file importer's javadocs don't mention it but you\r\ncan't examine just a single package using a ClassFileImporter.  It\r\nalways walks the subpackages of any package you give it and includes all\r\nof the classes found there.\r\n\r\nI've split off the \"org.apache.geode\" check into its own method and have\r\nadded a custom ImportOption that uses a Pattern to reject anything in a\r\nsub-package of org.apache.geode but allow those in the membership package (which is\r\nneeded for the API check).

is a problem with Geode WAN replication when GW receivers are configured with the same hostname-for-senders and port on all servers. The reason for such a setup is deploying Geode cluster on a Kubernetes cluster where all GW receivers are reachable from the outside world on the same VIP and port.\r\n \r\nThe problem experienced is that shutting down one server is stopping replication to this cluster until the server is up again. This is because Geode incorrectly assumes there are no more alive servers when just one of them is down, because since they share hostname-for-senders and port, they are treated as one same server.\r\n\r\nWith these changes locator is able to distinguish the different receivers using the same hostname and port so replication is not impacted when one server is stopped.\r\n\r\n( Link to

main goal here is to make it straightforward to start up a locator vis-à-vis membership. So code that looked like this (in `MembershipOnlyJUnitTest`):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    final Membership<MemberIdentifierImpl> membership =\r\n        MembershipBuilder.<MemberIdentifierImpl>newMembershipBuilder(\r\n            socketCreator, locatorClient, dsfidSerializer, memberIdFactory)\r\n            .setConfig(config)\r\n            .setLifecycleListener(lifeCycleListener)\r\n            .create();\r\n\r\n\r\n    // TODO - the membership *must* be installed in the locator at this special\r\n    // point during membership startup for the start to succeed\r\n    doAnswer(invocation -> {\r\n      membershipLocator.setMembership(membership);\r\n      return null;\r\n    }).when(lifeCycleListener).started();\r\n\r\n\r\n    membership.start();\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan look like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    final Membership<MemberIdentifierImpl> membership =\r\n        MembershipBuilder.<MemberIdentifierImpl>newMembershipBuilder(\r\n            socketCreator,\r\n            locatorClient,\r\n            dsfidSerializer,\r\n            memberIdFactory)\r\n            .setMembershipLocator(membershipLocator)\r\n            .setConfig(config)\r\n            .setLifecycleListener(lifeCycleListener)\r\n            .create();\r\n\r\n    membership.start();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR eliminates the `MembershipLocator.started()` method entirely and adds a `MembershipBuilder.setMembershipLocator()`. So instead of having to install a callback to initialize the locator's membership association, you now do it directly (imperatively) via the builder.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
