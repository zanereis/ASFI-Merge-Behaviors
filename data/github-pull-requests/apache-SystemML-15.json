- This PR enables two multi-output rewrites, which have two issues:\r\n1. It requires a statement block cut in the nn/layers/batchnorm2.dml for ResNet200. This is not necessary for simpler scripts (see BatchNormTest).\r\n2. It leads to slower performance compared to builtin function on GPU. This is likely due to redundant computation.\r\n\r\nOnce this two issues are fixed, we can merge this PR in.

@mboehm7 ,\r\n\r\nHere is the PR for fixing the problem of overhead in the context of distributed ps. In general, the problem of large task is resolved by removing the incorrect partitioner which is for assembling features and labels together. And the problem of missing cleanup for some rpc objects is due to that the way of communication between ps and workers in distributed ps is different from the local ps.

@mboehm7 ,\r\n\r\nHere is the PR for implementing the initial version of spark paramserv function. And just for information, in the spark ps test, there are some FIXMEs indicating that some error will be reproduced when specifying the epochs with 10. I'm hoping that you could maybe have a look on them because currently I have little idea to understand the problem.\r\n\r\nThanks for the review,\r\nGuobao","created_at":"2018-07-19T22:41:54Z","updated_at":"2018-07-22T19:41:38Z","closed_at":"2018-07-22T05:31:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21c86ce1f8750071b9ea6d38a375f20072942b4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/7b6fc61fc2d397bd83574a83611b2c2aaab4aa78","head":{"label":"EdgarLGB:systemml-2420","ref":"systemml-2420","sha":"7b6fc61fc2d397bd83574a83611b2c2aaab4aa78","user":{"login":"EdgarLGB","id":15153347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTUzMzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15153347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB","html_url":"https://github.com/EdgarLGB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123602502,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2MDI1MDI=","name":"systemml","full_name":"EdgarLGB/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EdgarLGB","id":15153347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTUzMzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15153347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB","html_url":"https://github.com/EdgarLGB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/EdgarLGB/systemml","description":"Mirror

the conversation in https://github.com/apache/systemml/pull/794 with @mboehm7 I have a made a couple improvements to the method used to profile memory use in JMLC:\r\n\r\n1. Removed the use of `SoftReference` to track when an object has been garbage collected. Objects are now removed (i.e. the memory used by them is subtracted from the total) when `ExectutionContext.cleanUpCacheableData` is called. This ensures that we always get a consistent maximum memory use which does not change depending on the max heap size used to initialize the JVM.\r\n2. Removed some unneeded code which won't be called during JMLC execution.\r\n\r\nDocumentation was also updated accordingly.","created_at":"2018-07-13T01:14:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-13T04:32:26Z","closed_at":"2018-07-13T04:32:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"41af2ade4aecac0b30d1b3557029fdb83f4be6c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/797/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/797/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/797/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/e1c5b0d45630bf4476b354665b753fbe65281049","head":{"label":"thomas9t:jmlc-memory-profiler","ref":"jmlc-memory-profiler","sha":"e1c5b0d45630bf4476b354665b753fbe65281049","user":{"login":"thomas9t","id":13305441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA1NDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13305441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t","html_url":"https://github.com/thomas9t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139201087,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzkyMDEwODc=","name":"systemml","full_name":"thomas9t/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thomas9t","id":13305441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzA1NDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13305441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t","html_url":"https://github.com/thomas9t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomas9t/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thomas9t/systemml","description":"Mirror

the conversation in https://github.com/apache/systemml/pull/794 with @mboehm7 I have a made a couple improvements to the method used to profile memory use in JMLC:\r\n\r\n1. Removed the use of `SoftReference` to track when an object has been garbage collected. Objects are now removed (i.e. the memory used by them is subtracted from the total) when `ExectutionContext.cleanUpCacheableData` is called. This ensures that we always get a consistent maximum memory use which does not change depending on the max heap size used to initialize the JVM.\r\n2. Removed some unneeded code which won't be called during JMLC execution.\r\n\r\nDocumentation was also updated

PR adds utilities to profile memory use during execution in JMLC. Specifically, the following changes were made:\r\n\r\n1. Added options `setStatistics()` and `gatherMemStats()` to `api.jmlc.Connection` which control whether or not statistics should be gathered, and if so, whether memory use should be profiled. Also added an appropriate method to `api.jmlc.PreparedScript` to display the resulting statistics. The following points are only applicable when running in JMLC mode, and memory statistics have been enabled. Both these options are `false` by default.\r\n2. Modified `utils.Statistics` to track the memory used by **distinct** `CacheBlock` objects. At the conclusion of the script, the maximum memory use is reported. Memory use is computed by calling the object's `getInMemorySize()` method. This will generally be a slight over-estimate of the actual memory used by the object. \r\n3. If `FINEGRAINED_STATISTICS` are enabled, `Statistics` will also track the memory use by each named variable in a DML script and report this in a table as in `heavy hitter instructions`. The goal of this is to detect unexpected large intermediate matrices (e.g. resulting from an outer product `X %*% t(X)`).\r\n4. If `FINEGRAINED_STATISTICS` are enabled, `Statistics` will attempt to measure more accurate memory use by checking to see if an object has been garbage collected. This is done by maintaining a soft reference to the object and periodically checking to see if it has become null. This is enabled only when using fine-grained statistics since it introduces potentially non-trivial overheads by scanning a list of live objects. Note that simply using `rmvar` to remove a live variable results in a substantial underestimate of memory used by the program and so this method is not used. When finegrained statistics are not enabled, the resulting statistics will be an overestimate.\r\n\r\nPotential impacts to performance: when finegrained statistics are enabled there will be some performance degradation from maintaining the set of live variables.\r\n\r\nPotential Improvements: Related to the above, it would be nice to find a way of accurately tracking when an object is actually released without resorting to checking whether a soft reference has become null. It might also be nice to include a line number indicating where a \"heavy hitting object\" was created to make debugging easier.\r\n\r\n@niketanpansare can you please take a look at these changes when you have time and let me know what you think?

This PR enables SystemML to reuse existing CPU/Spark optimizations (such as codegen) and also to exploit GPU-specific CUDA kernels.\r\n- As an initial step, I have only added `channel_sums` and `batch_norm2d_test` pattern. The latter will execute the `cudnnBatchNormalizationForwardInference` kernel.\r\n- This PR also adds a GPU+MLContext related bugfix for a specific case:  the output variable generated as part of a MLContext session with GPU enabled and passed to another MLContext with GPU disabled.\r\n\r\n@mboehm7 @nakul02 @bertholdreinwald Please review the PR and let me know if you have any specific

@mboehm7 ,\r\n\r\nHere is the PR for fixing the low accuracy occurred in the BATCH strategy. In general, the idea is to accrue the gradients in the ps side for the BATCH strategy just as what has been done for the local worker's accrued gradients. In this way, there is less computation to do in ps side and it improved slicely the performance. And then there is no more low accuracy occurred in my env. So I feel that something went wrong when intensely calling the agg function. But I don't know why.\r\n\r\nThanks for the review,\r\nGuobao","created_at":"2018-06-23T21:55:40Z","updated_at":"2018-07-13T10:37:11Z","closed_at":"2018-07-08T01:45:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bbde101c130afb3347ede6918a68b810f2d9a2be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/791/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/791/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/791/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/378ed68d3661d39b791c5c3ea17a4ae9f89975d0","head":{"label":"EdgarLGB:systemml-2403","ref":"systemml-2403","sha":"378ed68d3661d39b791c5c3ea17a4ae9f89975d0","user":{"login":"EdgarLGB","id":15153347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTUzMzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15153347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB","html_url":"https://github.com/EdgarLGB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123602502,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2MDI1MDI=","name":"systemml","full_name":"EdgarLGB/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EdgarLGB","id":15153347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTUzMzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15153347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB","html_url":"https://github.com/EdgarLGB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdgarLGB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/EdgarLGB/systemml","description":"Mirror

@mboehm7 ,\r\n\r\nHere is the PR for the initial version of local backend. To summarize, I implemented the \"_BSP_\" as well as \"_BATCH_\" update frequency which you can see in the new added test. In general, the idea is to launch a local ps which maintains a map. And the exchange of intermediates is done by looking up the corresponding key. On one hand, the local workers will work out and push the gradients to ps and then wait for a pending new global parameter pushed by the aggregation service. On the other hand, the aggregation service will wait for the pending gradients and then update and broadcast the updated model. \"_Broadcast_\" here means to deep copy the model and push them with each worker's \"global parameter\" key. So each worker will not impact the other's global parameter.\r\n\r\nThanks for the review,\r\nGuobao

task aims to cleanup redundant and thus unnecessary error logging in the package org.apache.sysml.parser. Specifically, there are many instances where the same (copied) error message is logged via LOG.error and thrown as an exception, which eventually ends up in the log as well. We should delete the redundant logging via LOG.error for all instances that are immediately followed by a thrown exception. As a byproduct this cleanup also increases maintainability because these redundant messages would otherwise require consistent updates.","created_at":"2018-05-15T23:24:43Z","updated_at":"2018-05-16T05:51:20Z","closed_at":"2018-05-16T05:51:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32c9acabe8ef0f02afe5f64f61f328924fd1db43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/762/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/762/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/762/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/f875e4d37c87f19199694bc0496d8580895559dd","head":{"label":"dematsunaga:SYSTEMML-2233-log-cleanup","ref":"SYSTEMML-2233-log-cleanup","sha":"f875e4d37c87f19199694bc0496d8580895559dd","user":{"login":"dematsunaga","id":18021426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDIxNDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18021426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dematsunaga","html_url":"https://github.com/dematsunaga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dematsunaga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dematsunaga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dematsunaga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dematsunaga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dematsunaga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dematsunaga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dematsunaga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dematsunaga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dematsunaga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"df3e12aa2fd032785c4e0db10cd2e952dccd289e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45896813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTg5NjgxMw==","name":"systemds","full_name":"apache/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds","description":"An

This commit improves the performance of LSTM forward by reducing unnecessary ping pongs between CPU-GPU due to left indexing.\r\n- There is no performance gains for CPU execution.\r\n- There is potential for further improvements by changing the shapes of `cache_ifog`.\r\n- I am marking this as WIP to discuss this further until we add support for CuDNN LSTM kernel. In specific, should we support left indexing on GPU (which complicates parfor/memory management on GPU due to update in-place) or use the approach in this PR ?\r\n\r\nThe setup is as follows:\r\n- LSTM forward invoked 5 times.\r\n- return_sequence = TRUE\r\n- minibatch size = 32\r\n- number of input features = 169\r\n- number of neurons = 128\r\n- sequence length = 3506 \r\n\r\nThis PR on
