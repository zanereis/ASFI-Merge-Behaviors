Azure File Share connection has not been creted in #15159 and it\r\ncaused an unexpected side effect as the default Azure Connection\r\npassed service_options dictionary to FileService\r\nwith key that was unexpected.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes two things:\r\n\r\n1) adds AzureFileShare connection that has separate conn_type\r\n   and handles the extra_options specific for FileService Hook\r\n   available in the Airflow UI.\r\n\r\n2) handles the \"deprecated\" way of passing keys without UI prefix\r\n   but raises a deprecation warning when such key is passed or\r\n   when the Wasb connection is used with an empty extras rather\r\n   than Azure File Share.\r\n\r\nFixes #16254\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/9975\r\n\r\nCurrently, we create dagruns unconditionaly when a DAG is unpaused or\r\nwhen a dagrun is manually triggered. Because of this, when we set max_active_runs=1\r\nand trigger a dagrun manually, the scheduled run will start at its time without respecting \r\nthe max_active_runs\r\n    \r\nThis change fixes it and

#16304.

I think (hope) this field is never updated after a run is created?\r\n* [x] Add `logical_date` and `data_interval` to template context.\r\n    * [x] Emit deprecation warning when the `execution_date` context variable is accessed. (fix #16372)\r\n* Change functions that create `DagRun` instances to use `data_interval`.\r\n    * [x] `DAG.create_dagrun()`\r\n    * [x] Connexion `post_dag_run()`\r\n    * [ ] (Optional) A lot of tests\r\n* Change functions that call `DAG.create_dagrun()` to use `data_interval`.\r\n\t* [x] `BackfillJob`\r\n\t* [x] `SchedulerJob`\r\n\t* [x] `SubDagOperator`\r\n\t* [x] Web UI manual trigger view\r\n\t* [ ] (Optional) A lot of tests\r\n\t* [ ] (Optional) Experiemental API\r\n* [x] Add documentation on how the template field meanings change and how they map to the previous values.\r\n* Test data interval is correctly populated when triggered\r\n\t* [x] In the scheduler (manual, scheduled, and backfilled, etc.)\r\n\t* [x] From the web UI\r\n\t* [x] From the CLI\r\n\t* From the stable API (this needs things in #17122 and will be a part of that PR instead)\r\n* Add documentation on data intervals.

all,\r\nI propose you this PR in order to fix 2 little bugs in Apache Sqoop behavior. \r\n\r\nI usually use Airflow combined with Sqoop to create ingestion pipelines from different databases (SQL server, Postgres or Oracle). \r\nI noticed:\r\n\r\n1. It was not possible to use Microsoft SQL Server Airflow connection with Sqoop Operator because the connection string generated from the Sqoop Hook code was wrong:\r\nThe code generated this connection string  `jdbc:sqlserver://<my_server>:<port>/<database>` but the correct string is ` jdbc:sqlserver://<my_server>:<port>;databaseName=<database>` ([official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/connection-string-syntax)). I corrected the code in order to generate the correct connection string for Microsoft SQL Server Connection.\r\n\r\n2. Sqoop import command accepts the parameter `schema`; the parameter describes the name of the schema that Sqoop should use ([official docs](https://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.4.7/SqoopUserGuide.html)). With the current implementation of the Sqoop Operator and Hook, it was not possible to specify this parameter. It was possible to add the parameter in the extra import/export parameters, but in this case, the schema parameter was added to the command in the wrong position: for the correct use of the parameter, this must be the last. \r\nSo I added the possibility for the user to use a specific parameter to specify which schema Sqoop should use.

DAG Serialization is a strict requirements since Airflow 2, we allowed users to control\r\nwhere the Webserver looked for when showing the **Code View**.\r\n\r\nIf `[core] store_dag_code` was set to

And the webserver just read it from the same table.\r\nIf the value was set to `False`, the webserver read it from the DAG file.\r\n\r\nWhile this setting made sense for Airflow < 2, it caused some confusion to some users where they thought\r\nthis setting controlled DAG Serialization.\r\n\r\nFrom Airflow 2.2, Airflow will only look for DB when a user clicks on **Code View** for a DAG.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/16323\r\n\r\nThe SFTP hook does not allow for a SSH private key string to be used, only a private key file path. As it is based on the SSH hook, which does allow for a private key string to be used, a small change could align these two hooks.\r\n\r\nThis change first checks if a paramiko object is present after the SSH hook has been initialised, and the prefers that rather than the ssh key file path.\r\n\r\nThis is more a working idea than a finished PR, If this approach is deemed acceptable I'll be happy to turn this into a fully formed code change.\r\n\r\nThanks in

PR fixes the following issue:\r\n**Airflow Helm chart cannot be installed by Argo CD because of \"migrate-database-job\" hook**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a popular continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.\r\nIt is used by many teams to deploy and manage applications in Kubernetes clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Problem description\r\n\r\nThere are 3 objects dependent on \"migrate-database-job\" hook:\r\n- [scheduler](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/chart/templates/scheduler/scheduler-deployment.yaml#L106)\r\n- [webserver](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/chart/templates/webserver/webserver-deployment.yaml#L100)\r\n- [worker](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/chart/templates/webserver/webserver-deployment.yaml#L100)\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation \"migrate-database-job\" hook is triggered before the main containers of scheduler, webserver and worker are started. So they have \"wait-for-airflow-migrations\" init-containers which wait for \"migrate-database-job\" to be done.\r\n\r\nHook \"wait-for-airflow-migrations\" is implemented by [Helm hooks](helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks).  However, Argo CD has its own hooks implementation and maps them to Helm hooks with some differences/restrictions.\r\nWith the current chart implementation Argo CD never triggers \"migrate-database-job\" hook because `\"helm.sh/hook\": post-install` is mapped to `\"argocd.argoproj.io/hook\": PostSync` which means that the hook has to be executed `after all Sync hooks completed and were successful, a successful application, and all resources in a Healthy state`([link to the doc](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/resource_hooks/#usage)).\r\nThis condition is never **true** because scheduler, webserver and worker stay in init state waiting for \"migrate-database-job\" to finish.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Argo CD hook annotations to override Helm hook annotations.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\nInstall Argo CD\r\n```\r\nhelm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm\r\nhelm repo update\r\nhelm install argocd argo/argo-cd --version

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/16227\r\n\r\nCurrently, the chances of tasks being killed by the LocalTaskJob heartbeat is high.\r\n\r\nThis is because, when mini scheduler is enabled, then after marking a task successful/failed in Taskinstance.py,\r\nwe start running the mini scheduler. Whenever the mini scheduling takes time and meets the next job heartbeat,\r\nthe heartbeat detects that this task has succeeded with no return code because LocalTaskJob.handle_task_exit\r\nwas not called after the task succeeded. Hence, the heartbeat thinks that this task was externally marked as failed/successful.\r\n\r\nThis change resolves this by moving the mini scheduler to LocalTaskJob at the handle_task_exit method ensuring\r\nthat the task will no longer be met by the next heartbeat\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR aims to introduce a analytics backend for [Apache Flagon UserALE JS](http://flagon.apache.org/userale/).\r\nApache UserALE (User Analytic Logging Engine) is the beating heart of Apache Flagon technology. UserALE provides instrumentation for applications, embedding a light-weight, easy-to-manage behavioral logging capability. UserALE provides comprehensive user event tracking for web pages, but it is specially engineered for thin-client analytical applications. UserALE transmits specially structured messages from your application to an activity logging server whenever users interact with it.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a very easy way to run the Airflow webserver such that I can test out this integration. Does anyone have a suggestion as to how I can deploy a local dev server i.e. webpack dev server or something similar so I can test this proposed feature out?\r\n\r\nThanks for any reviews... :)","created_at":"2021-06-03T01:24:15Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T00:04:52Z","closed_at":"2021-07-29T00:04:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e55ab7efaaaee6875f036488faae8c4dbefc22cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale PRs per the .github/workflows/stale.yml policy file"},{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.
