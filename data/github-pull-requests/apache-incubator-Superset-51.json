SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFixes #21827\r\n\r\nWhen a database is created `schema_cache_timeout`  property is set to empty string by default inside `extra_json` (or at least this is the case for older versions). This leads to the following error when calling `get_all_schema_names` which exptects an optional integer.

recommendation #&#x2060;4 in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14383, i.e., it prevents:\r\n\r\n1. A new filter-box visualization type chart being created; \r\n2. An existing filter-box visualization type being added to a dashboard (either via the edit dashboard or save chart workflow)\r\n\r\nif the `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` filter flag is enabled. \r\n\r\nNote the export/import dashboard workflow has not been augmented from a preservation standpoint, i.e., filter-boxes can still be imported when they're part of the exported dashboard. Finally, per SIP-64,\r\n\r\n> ... dashboard cannot regress to having both native and legacy filters.\r\n\r\nthe goal is to prevent an existing dashboard from regressing once native filters are enabled whereas the export/import workflow creates a new dashboard, i.e., it's exempt from the problematic workflows.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### CREATE \r\n\r\n#####

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a followup/based on PR from: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17319\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15132\r\n\r\nCurrently `memoized` data structure is not thread safe, can grow without bounds and is not safe on impure functions.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses python's `lru_cache` https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache.\r\nThe goal is to make it clear how cache is implemented and we should use it only on functions that respect the following on python's docs:\r\n\r\n> In general, the LRU cache should only be used when you want to reuse previously computed values. Accordingly, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to cache functions with side-effects, functions that need to create distinct mutable objects on each call, or impure functions such as time() or random().\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently giving a user \"database access on ...\" does indeed give access to all dashboards, charts and datasets on that database, but they don't show up on the list views. This fixes that. Other changes:\r\n- Similar logic existed in multiple places across the codebase, some of which were missing recently introduced permission logic. To DRY it up, we introduce a new util that generates the necessary filter clauses and use that in all places where we need to filter by accessible datasets.\r\n- The fairly recent PR #20135 introduced logic to display datasets that the user owns. While it's important to show datasets that are owned, the logic introduced in that PR is no longer necessary after this change, as users will now see all owned datasets, as long as they can access them. Therefore the added logic is removed and the integration test is replaced by a test that ensures that the correct datasets are visible with the correct roles/perms.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add a database \"X\"\r\n2. Create a role \"Y\" with the \"database access on X\" permission\r\n3. Add a dataset from the database, create a chart from it and also create + publish a dashboard from it.\r\n4. Create a user with roles \"Gamma\" and \"Y\"\r\n5. Login with that user and notice that the newly added dataset + chart + dashboard is now shown on the listview.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

we're looking to be able to search for an execution ID to tie together logs from the entire alert/report Celery job. To do this, I have added an execution_id to the Screenshot classes (dashboard and chart), the slack and email send methods and the webdriver screenshot method. The report task is already passing the execution id through to the commands, etc, so I also passed the celery execution id through the thumbnail generation to the screenshot logs as well.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22413 introduced logic for eager loading of the columns/metrics (as well as their back references) for a dataset, however the eagerness comes at a cost, i.e., the RESTful API GET `/api/v1/explore` endpoint is less performant given that all when fetching a slice or dataset the columns/metrics relationships are eagerly loaded.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a tradeoff where we lazily load the columns/metrics relationships which negatively impacts the `/api/v1/dataset` endpoint but speeds up the `/api/v1/explore` endpoint (the later is used significantly more than the former).  The TL;DR is the current behavior was hyper optimized for one use case which negatively impacted other workflows.\r\n\r\nThe proposed behavior works best in the general sense and is more akin to how objects were lazy loaded prior to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22413 though facets of the existing performance improvements‚Äîby not leveraging the `joined` [relationship](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/relationship_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.relationship)‚Äîremain. As we further refactor the API we can rethink said logic. \r\n\r\nSpecifically for Airbnb's uber dataset the results are:\r\n\r\n| Endpoint               | Current | Proposed |\r\n| ----------------  | -------- | --------- |\r\n| `/api/v1/dataset` | ~ 7 s      | ~ 26 s‚Ä†     | \r\n| `/api/v1/explore` | ~ 16 s    | ~ 5 s         |\r\n\r\n‚Ä† Note even though this is slower it is significantly faster than prior to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22413 which used to time out. Furthermore a significantly cost is in the (now) lazy loading of the back references, i.e., `metric.table` which likely could be refactored in code.  \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

`superset/copy_dash/<dash_id>/` and introduces `api/v1/dashboard/<dash_id>/copy/` to replace it.\r\n\r\nThe new endpoint behaves nearly identically to the old one; the only functional differences are that the endpoint accepts a json body instead of a form, and it only responds with the data used by the frontend.\r\n\r\nThis PR also marks the `superset/save_dash/<dash_id>/` endpoint as deprecated as it is not called from client code anywhere.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWe are now enabling users to export databases that have SSHTunnels related to them. The exported ssh_tunnel will get included in the `database` `yaml` file and will have the used login method (`password` or `private_key + private_key_password`) with masked values.\r\nThen when user tries to import such databases (or any dashboard/chart/dataset/savedquery), the modal will ask the user to enter such credentials.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Export a DB with SSH Tunnel\r\n2. The exported file should include the `ssh_tunnel` with masked login method\r\n3. Try importing a DB that has `ssh_tunnel` in it\r\n4. The modal should ask you to enter the credentials (`password` OR `private_key + private_key_password`)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nThanks to the great work done by @lyndsiWilliams removing the test warnings, I was able to identify a common pattern in the use of icons by test files. This PR takes advantage of this pattern and globally mocks the `Icons` component to remove the following warning from tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.error\r\n      Warning: An update to Icon inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Execute all tests\r\n2 - All tests should pass with no referred warning\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nThis fixes the connection string for Teradata in the docs. We're recommending using [teradatasqlalchemy](https://pypi.org/project/teradatasqlalchemy/) which states you should use `teradatasql://`, not `teradata://`. See the screenshot from their README:\r\n<img width=\"796\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/217826242-95c5a537-c362-44cf-83f4-ab615a2fa945.png\">\r\n\r\nIt was reported that using `teradata://` ends up using `BaseEngineSpec`, which simply doesn't work: Teradata uses TOP syntax instead of LIMIT, not to mention time grains etc that will otherwise be missing.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

to establish wrapping consistency between opening block statements and else blocks by\ngrouping params in opening blocks. This causes params to break to a new line together and not be split across lines\nunless the length of params exceeds the print width. This also updates the else block wrapping to behave exactly the\nsame as opening blocks.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<pre lang=\"hbs\"><code>{{!

(:issue:`2916`)\n<h2>v4.4.4 (2023-01-31)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.4\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forward <code>HOME</code> by default - by :user:<code>gschaffner</code>. (:issue:<code>2702</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.4.3 (2023-01-30)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.3</p>\n<pre><code>- Tox will now expand self-referential extras discovered in package deps to respect local modifications to package\n  metadata. This allows a package extra to explicitly depend on another package extra, which previously only worked with\n  non-static metadata - by :user:`masenf`. (:issue:`2904`)\n<h2>v4.4.2 (2023-01-25)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.2\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow the user configuration file (default <code>&lt;appdir&gt;/tox/config.ini</code>) to be overridden via the\n<code>TOX_USER_CONFIG_FILE</code> environment variable. Previously tox was looking at the <code>TOX_CONFIG_FILE</code> to override the\nuser configuration, however that environment variable is already used to override the main configuration - by\n:user:<code>masenf</code>. (:issue:<code>2890</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.4.1 (2023-01-25)</h2>\n<p>Bugfixes - 4.4.1</p>\n<pre><code>- In tox 4.4.0 ``constrain_package_deps`` was introduced with a default value of ``True``. This has been changed back to\n  ``False``, which restores the original behavior of tox 4.3.5 - by :user:`masenf`.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR makes two small tweaks to flaky/failing tests:\r\n- `dashboard/nativeFilters.test.ts:should show \"more filters\" on window resizing up and down`: stopped `openMoreFilters` from waiting for the `postFilterState` request, as this was sometimes happening before the wait was started causing flakes/fails.\r\n- `dashboard/load.test.ts:should send log data`: increased the wait time from the 10s default to 15s, as I think the dashboard taking longer than 10s to load was causing this wait to timeout.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nFixes Time Column filters when `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` is enabled. Specifically:\r\n- If a time column is applied and the x-axis is temporal, replace the x-axis and its associated filter with the time column\r\n- If a time column is applied and the x-axis is NOT temporal, replace the first temporal filter with the time column if the time column is not already in the filters\r\n- Moves to the server side the behavior of applying a time range to all temporal filters\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n(See associated issue below about the background of the issue)\r\nHandle correctly the issue on the SQLA connector specifically composing the SQL WHERE clause.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n* only checks the granularity then defaults to appending the filters to WHERE clause together with AND\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n* aside from granularity check, we also check how many filters:\r\n  * if there's more than 1 filter, we append together with AND in the WHERE clause\r\n  * if there's only 1 filter, we append without AND in the WHERE clause\r\n* no more default since if there's no filter, WHERE clause

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n**Issue:** Cache-warmup API does not work as expected for all charts. Running cache-warmup for a slice ex: (vizType-Table) and exploring the same slice on browser gives different cache key.\r\n\r\n**Solution:** /warm_up_cache/ API in current solution only applicable for legacy chart and those are very few in numbers, and when the same code executes for another type of chart such as Table chart and other non-legacy chart, it generates a different cache key not matching with the one we get while exploring the same slice on browser. Fix given here will check the viz type of the chart and handle it in the required way to update the right cache-key.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard that includes table chart.\r\n2. Configure cache warm up schedule in superset_config.py.\r\n3. Verify if the cache got refreshed after cache warm up execution using menu option at top-right corner of the chart.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes a bug introduced by (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21186) that caused increasing local storage size dramatically (which makes the space limitation warning frequently). This is because the [migration logic](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21186/files#diff-407b1e72d7f4462c85eca33d215cd9981b18db050f649dfaaac5748a262d09b8R163) flip to `query.cached` from

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/22614 we moved the selenium capture element for dashboards to \".standalone\" so that we would get the full margins in the image instead of the sides being cut off. This broke some thumbnail generators where selenium was looking for that class to load, but it did not exist. In this PR, I am moving the standalone logic closer to the screenshot logic where the element is defined so that it's nearer downstream to the code that depends on it. I also swapped out the code in the report link for example where we were removing the standalone link because it's not needed there. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nAs noted in many issues, alembic migrations aren't logged when doing upgrades in Helm which makes debugging a failing `superset-init-db` job impossible. \r\n\r\nThis change comes from issue #17991 and a related issue in the flask migrate repository [here](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-Migrate/issues/434)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\nNo flask_migrate error logs to show the issue as to why `superset-init-db` fails. It would look exactly like the after screenshot below with no `ERROR [flask_migrate] Error: Can't locate revision identified by 'f3c2d8ec8595'` line.\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nLogs include flask_migrate error message.\r\n<img width=\"989\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-02-03 at 3 36 36 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28707707/216705888-3c788d10-fa89-43f7-bf60-5ae842bdd733.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Deploy a version of superset on kubernetes using helm\r\n2. Upgrade this helm installation to a version of superset that has migrations \r\n3. See logs occurring.

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20965 refactored `SaveModal` and stored the `form_data` in Redux. Actions that were dependent on the `form_data` were updated to query Redux instead of receiving it via params. The problem left by the refactoring was that `setFormData` was not being consistently called and dependent actions such as `createSlice` and `updateSlice` were not receiving the latest `form_data` object. This PR fixes this problem.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Create a new chart\r\n2 - Add some controls\r\n3 - Make sure the form_data received by SaveModal has all the modified values\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR changes the validation logic to prevent the removal of the last temporal filter from a chart. Many features depend on the existence of at least one temporal filter set. This also helps with scenarios where users don't understand why a time range filter is not being applied to a chart.\r\n\r\n@kasiazjc \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED
