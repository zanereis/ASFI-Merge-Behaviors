within test check for bulkset with elements (i.e., Vertex, Edge, VertexProperty) by using contains method. Due to changes w.r.t. Gremlin comparison semantics (cf. https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.7.0/dev/provider/#gremlin-semantics-concepts) this check was no longer done efficiently, which led to some regressions (see query/example below). In some cases, we can however ensure that the contains of the bulkset (using hash code and Object.equals) leads to the same results as the GremlinValueComparator.COMPARABILITY.equals. In fact, for elements, both checks are only be done with the ids of these elements.\r\n\r\nThis change re-enables an efficient check for elements (if the bulkset also contains these elements and only contains these kind of elements). This is realized via a transient attribute (allContainedElementsSameClass) in the bulkset class that represents whether all elements are of same type/class, which is checked by the within test method. Tje attribute is computed lazily when accessed to avoid overhead if the information is not required.\r\n\r\nPseudo code for sample data:\r\n```\r\nfinal Vertex x1 = G.addVertex(T.id, \"x1\", T.label, \"person\", \"age\", 27, \"name\", \"x1\");\r\n// many friends for x1\r\nfor (int i = 1; i < 10000; ++i) {\r\n    final Vertex x1fi = G.addVertex(T.id, \"f\"+i, T.label, \"person\", \"age\", 27, \"name\", \"f\"+i);\r\n    x1.addEdge(\"knows\", x1fi, T.id, \"e-x1-f\"+i, \"weight\", 0.5);\r\n}\r\n// one special friend that also has many other friends\r\nfinal Vertex x1f0 = G.addVertex(T.id, \"f0\", T.label, \"person\", \"age\", 27, \"name\", \"f0\");\r\nx1.addEdge(\"knows\", x1f0, T.id, \"e-x1-f0\", \"weight\", 0.5);\r\n\r\n// adding these many other friends, so friends of friends for x1\r\nfor (int i = 1; i < 10000; ++i) {\r\n    final Vertex x1f0ofi = G.addVertex(T.id, \"fof\"+i, T.label, \"person\", \"age\", 27, \"name\", \"fof\"+i);\r\n    x1f0.addEdge(\"knows\", x1f0ofi, T.id, \"e-f0-f\"+i, \"weight\", 0.5);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample query (which is very inefficiently executed without this change):\r\n```\r\ng.V(\"x1\").as(\"root\").aggregate(\"directFriends\")\r\n                                .select(\"root\").out().aggregate(\"directFriends\")\r\n                                .select(\"directFriends\").limit(1).unfold().out().where(without(\"directFriends\"))\r\n```\r\nThe query is obviously not optimally formulated, but reproduces the issue","created_at":"2024-01-04T14:28:28Z","updated_at":"2024-01-18T17:30:33Z","closed_at":"2024-01-18T17:30:33Z","merged_at":"2024-01-18T17:30:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1a3009b71a99b9944ffa1aca4c76818cd44de5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2425/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2425/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2425/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/7bdc66d90abced17a2a95ceaaf00999e7744ad84","head":{"label":"steigma:bulkset-contains-check-improvement-3.6-dev","ref":"bulkset-contains-check-improvement-3.6-dev","sha":"7bdc66d90abced17a2a95ceaaf00999e7744ad84","user":{"login":"steigma","id":87522003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTIyMDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87522003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma","html_url":"https://github.com/steigma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":495959294,"node_id":"R_kgDOHY-8_g","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"steigma/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steigma","id":87522003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTIyMDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87522003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma","html_url":"https://github.com/steigma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steigma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steigma/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

has been changed in .NET 8. Before .NET 8, it simply returned `null` if `MoveNext()` wasn't called first. With .NET 8 however it throws an exception.\r\nSince this has apparently already been undefined behavior before, we should fix this irrespective of .NET 8:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/85243#issuecomment-1521085177\r\n\r\nThe problem can be reproduced by executing the Gherkin tests with .NET without the change in `DefaultTraversal` (by changing the `TargetFramework` in `Gremlin.Net.IntegrationTest.csproj` to `net8.0`). .NET 8 needs to be installed for this of course.\r\n\r\nVOTE

multi-architecture AMD64/ARM64 docker images in gremlin-console deployment. This was previously disabled due to observed instabilities in the image. Previously the ARM image was plagued by severe latency and widespread freezing and crashing. These issues were stemming from the docker engine as the console has run natively on arm flawlessly for several releases now. With recent improvements to docker, I am unable to find any issues with the console images. The arm console container is now snappy, responsive, and stable in my testing.\r\n\r\nVOTE

fixes.  The upgrade should be just a matter of raising the version number, however JDK 7 support has been dropped at runtime.</p>\n<p>A merge of the JANSI library into <a href=\"https://github.com/jline/jline3\">JLine</a> is being considered.  This would avoid duplication of somewhat similar code and ease the maintenance of both projects.  If your project is using the <code>org.fusesource.jansi.io</code> or <code>org.fusesource.jansi.internal</code> package, please drop us a note in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fusesource/jansi/issues/277\">fusesource/jansi#277</a> so that we can discuss things.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix missing synchronisation in

The <code>cache</code> input is optional, and caching is turned off by default, <code>cache-dependency-path</code> is used to specify the path to a dependency file - <code>packages.lock.json</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Example of use-case:</strong></p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3\n  with:\n    dotnet-version: 6.x\n    cache: true\n    cache-dependency-path: subdir/packages.lock.json\n</code></pre>\n<p>More details can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet#caching-nuget-packages\">action's documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/compare/v3...v3.2.0\">https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/compare/v3...v3.2.0</a></p>\n<h2>v3.1.0</h2>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<p>This minor release includes the following new <strong>features</strong>:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

`withEmbedded()` and `withRemote()` and removes the long deprecated\r\n`withGraph()`. A single unified with() removes the need to check the object being given to the `AnonymousTraversalSource` to decide which method to use. Can't remember why that split was used in the first place. This should make it easier to explain how to use the `AnonymousTraversalSource` in the first place, requires a bit less typing and simply streamlines the API.\r\n\r\nVOTE

directly. This may address <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6657\">&quot;Could not find <code>some-dependency</code>&quot; errors</a> that some users have reported (which might be a result of users' excluding <code>guava-parent</code>). (c6d35cf1a5)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Changed <code>Multisets.unmodifiableMultiset(set).removeIf(predicate)</code> to throw an exception always, even if nothing matches <code>predicate</code>. (61dbccfda3)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Fixed the behavior of <code>Graph</code>/<code>ValueGraph</code> views for a node when that node is removed from the graph. (950799691c)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Fixed <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> under <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6634\">Windows <em>services</em>, a rare use case</a>. (The fix actually covers only Java 9+ because Java 8 would require an additional approach. Let us know if you need support under Java 8.)

Beyond that, the choice of constructor remains undefined. (For this and other reasons, we discourage the use of <code>getChecked</code>.)
