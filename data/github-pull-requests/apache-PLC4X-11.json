original design of the S7 driver delegates the closing of the created tasks to the GC, which does not guarantee that they are closed deterministically.\r\n\r\nIn practice, it is always advisable to call the closure of tasks in a planned way and not delegate it to the GC.\r\n\r\nThe \"RequestTransactionManager\" is modified, to which a public \"shutdown\" method is added to end the group of associated tasks in a scheduled manner.\r\n\r\n\"S7ProtocolLogic\" is changed so that during the \"onDisconnect\" process, all tasks associated with the driver are called to end.\r\n\r\nThe task groups are identified in such a way to facilitate their diagnosis with the profiler.\r\n\r\nAdded some additional fields that will be required for the high availability (\"HA\") version of the driver.\r\n\r\nMultiple tests are carried out, and it always ends correctly without leaving ghost tasks.\r\n\r\nBest

PR fixes the binary writing problem on S7 drivers.\r\n\r\nThe problem originated in the use of padding in the \"S7VarPayloadDataItem\" type.\r\n\r\nThe last Item associated with a writing process does not require the use of padding, so it must be considered in the \"S7ProtocolLogic\".\r\n\r\nLikewise, a static method \"PADCOUNT\" is added, to add or not the padding depending on the \"hasNext\" flag.\r\n\r\nTests have been carried out and no other processes of the S7 driver are affected.","created_at":"2023-01-28T16:58:46Z","updated_at":"2023-01-29T00:37:56Z","closed_at":"2023-01-29T00:37:54Z","merged_at":"2023-01-29T00:37:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd8d1f4608fef510204f5300369fe6bded066d63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/770/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/770/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/770/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/statuses/4d7abdc2f4318dcc9b9f8b830fcced614a20d222","head":{"label":"apache:issue-701","ref":"issue-701","sha":"4d7abdc2f4318dcc9b9f8b830fcced614a20d222","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114859883,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ4NTk4ODM=","name":"plc4x","full_name":"apache/plc4x","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x","description":"PLC4X

to add a property in NiFi-integration processors to allow users to choose address definition strategy and add support for Expression Language in addresses definition.\r\n\r\n## Issues related:\r\n* #648: As stated, adding a lot of addresses as dynamic properties can be tedious. \r\n* #593 (Jira [PLC4X-196](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PLC4X-196)): Expression Language can be supported easily on addresses definition.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior:\r\nAddresses are specified one by one as dynamic properties in the processor and stored in a map when `onScheduled` method is triggered.\r\nExpression Language is not supported.\r\n\r\n## Proposed behavior:\r\nLet user decide between 2 strategies to obtain addresses in the processor:\r\n* Properties as addresses (as actual behavior but with Expression Language): 1 address per dynamic property.\r\n* Property \"Address Text\": a property where all addresses can be specified as field-value pairs in a JSON.\r\n\r\nAn address map created every time when `onTrigger` method is

`mockito.version` from 4.11.0 to 5.0.0.\nUpdates `mockito-core` from 4.11.0 to 5.0.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases\">mockito-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.0.0</h2>\n<h1>Mockito 5: prepare for future JDK versions</h1>\n<p>For a while now, we have seen an increase in problems/incompatibilities with recent versions of the JDK due to our usage of JVM-internal API.\nMost notably, JDK 17 made some changes which are incompatible with the current subclass mockmaker.\nTherefore, to prepare for the future of JDK, we are making some core changes to ensure Mockito keeps on working.</p>\n<h2>Switch the default mockmaker to <code>mockito-inline</code></h2>\n<p>Back in Mockito 2.7.6, we published a new mockmaker based on the &quot;inline bytecode&quot; principle.\nThis mockmaker creates mocks manipulating bytecode equivalent within the original class such that its method implementations hook into the normal Mockito machinery.\nAs a comparison, the subclass mockmaker generates &quot;real&quot; subclasses for mocks, to mimic the same behavior.\nWhile the approaches are similar, the inline mockmaker avoids certain restrictions that the JDK imposes.\nFor example, it does not violate module boundaries (introduced in JDK 9, but more heavily used in JDK 17) and avoids the leaking of the creation of the subclass.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>When should I still be using the subclass mockmaker?</h3>\n<p>There are legitimate remaining use cases for the subclass mockmaker.\nFor example, on the Graal VM's native image, the inline mockmaker will not work and the subclass mockmaker is the appropriate choice.\nAdditionally, if you would like to avoid mocking final classes, using the subclass mockmaker is a possibibility.\nNote however that if you solely want to use the subclass mockmaker to avoid mocking final, you will run into the above mentioned issues on JDK 17+.\nWe want to leave this choice up to our users, which is why we will keep on supporting the subclass mockmaker.</p>\n<p>If you want to use the subclass mockmaker instead, you can use the new <code>mockito-subclass</code> artifact (published <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-subclass\">on Maven Central</a> along with all our other artifacts).</p>\n<h2>Update the minimum supported Java version to 11</h2>\n<p>Mockito 4 supports Java 8 and above.\nSimilar to other open source projects, we are moving away from JDK 8 and to newer versions.\nThe primary reason for moving away from JDK 8 is the increasing maintenance costs with keeping our own infrastructure working.\nLately we have been running into more and more JDK 8 breakages.\nAdditionally, while we want to support the newest JDK API's, our current solution to support both JDK 8 and newer versions causes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/mockito/mockito/issues/2798\">issues with the <code>SecurityManager</code></a>.\nSince we want Mockito to work on the newest version and more and more businesses adopting JDK 11, we have decided to make the switch as well.</p>\n<p>Massive thanks to community member <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who implemented this change.</p>\n<h3>What should I do if I still run JDK 8?</h3>\n<p>For JDK 8 and below, you can keep on using Mockito 4.\nThis is similar to if you are using JDK 6, for which you can keep on using Mockito 2.\nThe changes in Mockito 5 (for now) are primarily focused on the latest JDK versions, which means the API differences between Mockito 4 and 5 are minimal.\nHowever, over time this will most likely widen, so we do recommend adopting JDK 11 in the future.</p>\n<h2>New <code>type()</code> method on <code>ArgumentMatcher</code></h2>\n<p>One of our most used public API's for customizing Mockito is the <a href=\"https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/ArgumentMatcher.html\"><code>ArgumentMatcher</code> interface</a>.\nThe interface allows you to define a custom matcher, which you can pass into method arguments to provide more targeted matches.\nOne major shortcoming of the <code>ArgumentMatcher</code> was the lack of varargs support.</p>\n<!-- raw

is my proposed set of (what I think are) improvements for the ModbusTag code.\r\nSummary:\r\n- The equals and hashcode were incorrect because the name of the actual class also matters.\r\n- My take on reducing the confusion around the -1 offset and the code complexity around all of this:\r\n  - Simplified the code for readability\r\n  - There is now a getLogicalAddress which returns the address the user configured.\r\n  - The getAddressString returns a string that parses (which was not the case) AND yields an identical new tag when parsed (which was not the case: was shifted by 1 most of the time).\r\n  - A more extensive set of tests that verifies all of this and ensures all supported formats for all tags yield the correct tag that is identical regardless of the used format.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your feedback.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-08T13:53:54Z","updated_at":"2023-01-08T16:24:02Z","closed_at":"2023-01-08T16:24:02Z","merged_at":"2023-01-08T16:24:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"8c49f4c5ada45e17f95cdfe892bd5e3a11db762f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/732/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/732/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/732/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/statuses/31f4078c2136ee0d42b54a51256a9c6b402cd0b0","head":{"label":"nielsbasjes:ModbusTagCleanup","ref":"ModbusTagCleanup","sha":"31f4078c2136ee0d42b54a51256a9c6b402cd0b0","user":{"login":"nielsbasjes","id":240096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDA5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes","html_url":"https://github.com/nielsbasjes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":583003979,"node_id":"R_kgDOIr_vSw","name":"plc4x","full_name":"nielsbasjes/plc4x","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nielsbasjes","id":240096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDA5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes","html_url":"https://github.com/nielsbasjes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nielsbasjes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nielsbasjes/plc4x","description":"PERSONAL

search syntax</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/findleyr\"><code>@​findleyr</code></a>). The following syntax is supported:\n<ul>\n<li><code>'</code> for exact matching</li>\n<li><code>^</code> for prefix matching</li>\n<li><code>$</code> for suffix matching</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: This feature does not yet work in VS Code. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/647\">golang/vscode-go#647</a> and <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/106788\">microsoft/vscode#106788</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An experimental new code lens to view GC optimization details (<a href=\"https://github.com/pjweinb\"><code>@​pjweinb</code></a>). Once the code lens is enabled, you will see a <code>Toggle gc details</code> annotation at the top of your file. Clicking it will show optimization diagnostics produced by the Go compiler, and clicking it once again will hide these diagnostics. Enable the code lens by adding the following to your settings:\n<pre lang=\"json5\"><code>&quot;codelens&quot;: {\n\t&quot;gc_details&quot;: true\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><code>go mod tidy</code> and <code>go mod vendor</code> code lenses for <code>go.mod</code> files (<a href=\"https://github.com/dandua98\"><code>@​dandua98</code></a>).</li>\n<li>Support for filling in matching in-scope variables instead of just empty values in fillstruct and fillreturns (<a href=\"https://github.com/joshbaum\"><code>@​joshbaum</code></a>).</li>\n<li>Autocompletion within import statements (<a href=\"https://github.com/dandua98\"><code>@​dandua98</code></a>).</li>\n<li>Autocompletion within package declarations (<a href=\"https://github.com/dandua98\"><code>@​dandua98</code></a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvements to workspace symbols ranking and fuzzy matching (<a href=\"https://github.com/findleyr\"><code>@​findleyr</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/myitcv\"><code>@​myitcv</code></a>).</li>\n<li>Better completion suggestions in type switch case clauses and for calls to <code>append</code>, function literals, and unnamed types (<a href=\"https://github.com/muirdm\"><code>@​muirdm</code></a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Thank you</h2>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/heschik\"><code>@​heschik</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/findleyr\"><code>@​findleyr</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pjweinb\"><code>@​pjweinb</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/joshbaum\"><code>@​joshbaum</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mcjcloud\"><code>@​mcjcloud</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dandua98\"><code>@​dandua98</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/muirdm\"><code>@​muirdm</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leitzler\"><code>@​leitzler</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/myitcv\"><code>@​myitcv</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/matloob\"><code>@​matloob</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tennashi\"><code>@​tennashi</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ainar-g\"><code>@​ainar-g</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hasheddan\"><code>@​hasheddan</code></a></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

in the 2.5 release chain.  Arguably it could also have been a minor release due to some quasi-feature updates.  It is anticipated that this will be the last release for 2.5.x.</p>\n<p>The next minor release (2.6.0) will probably require updating to at least go 1.17 as we move towards updating imports and adopting additional language features.</p>\n<p>Fixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On Windows (and some other platforms) custom TTYs did not work (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/580\">#580</a>)</li>\n<li>Default to using narrow for ambiguous characters in East Asian locales (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/578\">#578</a>)\nThis affected a lot of folks in East Asian locales, and now tcell applications should work by default for them.\nIf overrides to the RUNEWIDTH_EASTASIAN environment are present they will still be honored.</li>\n<li>Fix for intermittent screen flashes (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/576\">#576</a>)</li>\n<li>Encoding sub package now registers all encodings when imported.

Raymond)</li>\n<li>Fix for mouse-wheel/click-drag conflation (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/574\">#574</a>)</li>\n<li>Hyperlink ID support added (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/568\">#568</a>) (thanks to Tim Culverhouse)</li>\n<li>Paste support added to views.Application (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/552\">#552</a>) (thanks to Chris Bradbury)</li>\n<li>WidgetWatcher is concurrency-safe (thanks to Tim Culverhouse)</li>\n<li>Fix for CellView.Size() (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/553\">#553</a>) (thanks to Chris Bradbury)</li>\n<li>Fix for tput escape sequence errors (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/546\">#546</a>)</li>\n<li>Horizontal, Vertical are now type Orientation (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/543\">#543</a>) (thanks to Zaim Bakar)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/0fb7c000c5ffb06682cbfdf51e346322f55aebb9\"><code>0fb7c00</code></a> Fix status badges (broken by shields.io)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/dc01b79c87308febfa870dca1975e823cce97ccc\"><code>dc01b79</code></a> fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/580\">#580</a> tcell custom tty on Windows will not work</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/2f889d79bd61b1fd2f43372529975a65b792a7ae\"><code>2f889d7</code></a> Make RUNEWIDTH_EASTASIAN=0 the default.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/a6425479225cdcc46be7f1560b49b8dc4e3bdec2\"><code>a642547</code></a> fixes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gdamore/tcell/issues/576\">#576</a> Intermittent screen flashes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/44c298f729beb82572d4b45a980db4a57e7e7de1\"><code>44c298f</code></a> Encoding package should initialize at import.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/916a717ae81e938a9b8f787a29317a4638f335ad\"><code>916a717</code></a> Add example case for registering encodings.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/e6d83cf4c3ede965710ba4f14202fe0dd7b28b01\"><code>e6d83cf</code></a> Import order fix.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/85d85c15bae90ffc1bc30d10f400e4b699793c40\"><code>85d85c1</code></a> Minor comment fixups.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/ce3f911d8310b5d2949c6702c1d003ac725c90f3\"><code>ce3f911</code></a> Bump golang.org/x/text from 0.4.0 to 0.5.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/commit/68adf4676d0747934bbaa073a656ed3005972d1f\"><code>68adf46</code></a> update README with gbb repo link</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/compare/v2.5.3...v2.5.4\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2&package-manager=go_modules&previous-version=2.5.3&new-version=2.5.4)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gopls/v0.4.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved support for working with modules (<a href=\"https://github.com/ridersofrohan\"><code>@​ridersofrohan</code></a>). A detailed walk-through of the new features can be found <a href=\"https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2020/04/modules-05-gopls-improvements.html\">here</a>. A quick summary:\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <code>-modfile</code> flag to suggest which modules should be added/removed from the <code>go.mod</code> file, rather than editing it automatically.</li>\n<li>Suggest dependency upgrades in-editor and provide additional language features, such as formatting, for the <code>go.mod</code> file.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Inverse implementations (<a href=\"https://github.com/muirdm\"><code>@​muirdm</code></a>). &quot;Go to implementations&quot; on a concrete type will show the interfaces it implements.</li>\n<li>Completion improvements (<a href=\"https://github.com/muirdm\"><code>@​muirdm</code></a>). Specifically, improved completion for keywords. Also, offer <code>if err != nil { return err }</code> as a completion item.</li>\n<li>Jumping to definition on an import statement returns all files as definition locations (<a href=\"https://github.com/danishprakash\"><code>@​danishprakash</code></a>).</li>\n<li>Support for running <code>go generate</code> through the editor, via a code lens (<a href=\"https://github.com/marwan-at-work\"><code>@​marwan-at-work</code></a>).</li>\n<li>Command-line support for workspace symbols (<a href=\"https://github.com/daisuzu\"><code>@​daisuzu</code></a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Opt-in:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Code actions suggesting <code>gofmt -s</code>-style simplifications (<a href=\"https://github.com/ridersofrohan\"><code>@​ridersofrohan</code></a>). To get these on-save, add the following setting:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>&quot;[go]&quot;: {\n\t&quot;editor.codeActionsOnSave&quot;: {\n\t\t&quot;source.fixAll&quot;: true,\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Code actions suggesting fixes for type errors, such as missing return values (<a href=\"https://github.com/sqs/goreturns\">goreturns</a>-style), undeclared names, unused parameters, and assignment statements that should be converted from <code>:=</code> to <code>=</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/ridersofrohan\"><code>@​ridersofrohan</code></a>). Add the following to your gopls settings to opt-in to these analyzers. In the future, they will be on by default and high-confidence suggested fixes may be applied on save. See additional documentation on analyzers <a href=\"https://cs.opensource.google/go/tools/+/master:gopls/doc/analyzers.md\">here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre lang=\"json5\"><code>&quot;gopls&quot;: {\n\t&quot;analyses&quot;: {\n\t\t&quot;fillreturns&quot;: true,\n                &quot;undeclaredname&quot;: true,\n                &quot;unusedparams&quot;: true,\n                &quot;nonewvars&quot;: true,\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Further improvements in the support for multiple concurrent clients (<a href=\"https://github.com/findleyr\"><code>@​findleyr</code></a>). See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/golang/tools/issues/34111\">#34111</a> for all details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a complete list of the issues resolved, see the <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/milestone/133?closed=1\">gopls/v0.4.0 milestone</a>.</p>\n<h2>gopls/v0.3.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://golang.org/cl/222979\">golang.org/cl/222979</a>: fix for a nil pointer exception in completion (<a href=\"https://github.com/muirdm\"><code>@​muirdm</code></a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://golang.org/cl/222980\">golang.org/cl/222980</a>: fix a concurrent map write and iteration (<a href=\"https://github.com/ridersofrohan\"><code>@​ridersofrohan</code></a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>gopls/v0.3.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for workspace symbols. (<a href=\"https://github.com/daisuzu\"><code>@​daisuzu</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Various completion improvements, including fixes for completion in code that doesn't parse. (<a href=\"https://github.com/muirdm\"><code>@​muirdm</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Limit diagnostic concurrency, preventing huge spikes in memory usage that some users encountered. (<a href=\"https://github.com/heschik\"><code>@​heschik</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Improved handling for URIs containing escaped characters. (<a href=\"https://github.com/heschik\"><code>@​heschik</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Module versions from &quot;go list&quot; in pkg.go.dev links.
