What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-21870 (https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/cb0cddffe9452937033e0e6b1fc0e600d2c787ad#diff-06dc5de6163687b7810aa76e7e152a76R146-R149) caused significant performance regression in cases where the source code size is fairly large as `HashAggregateExec` uses `Block.length` to decide on splitting the code. The change in `def length` makes sense as the comment and extra new lines shouldn't be taken into account when deciding on splitting, but the regular expression based approach is very slow and adds a big relative overhead to cases where the execution is quick (small number of rows).\r\nThis PR replaces the slow regular expression based comment and extra new line removal to a much faster custom code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix performance regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExtended

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn ExecutionPage, metrics format for stageId, attemptId and taskId are displayed like `(stageId (attemptId): taskId)` for now.\r\nI changed this format like `(stageId.attemptId taskId)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs @cloud-fan suggested  [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27927#discussion_r398591519), `stageId.attemptId` is more standard in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nModified `SQLMetricsSuite` and manual test.","created_at":"2020-03-26T18:27:06Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T05:35:46Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T05:35:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"626762b0661ce84a6a8d06a084fa8ff53d370459","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28039/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28039/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28039/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/006cdf3262a20ebb8d3c01673f205cb6f6e44626","head":{"label":"sarutak:improve-metrics-format","ref":"improve-metrics-format","sha":"006cdf3262a20ebb8d3c01673f205cb6f6e44626","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a cleanShuffleDependencies as an experimental developer feature to allow folks to clean up shuffle files more aggressively than we currently do.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDynamic scaling on Kubernetes (introduced in Spark 3) depends on only shutting down executors without shuffle files. However Spark does not aggressively clean up shuffle files (see SPARK-5836) and instead depends on JVM GC on the driver to trigger deletes. We already have a mechanism to explicitly clean up shuffle files from the ALS algorithm where we create a lot of quickly orphaned shuffle files. We should expose this as an advanced developer feature to enable people to better clean-up shuffle files improving dynamic scaling of their jobs on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis adds a new experimental API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nALS already used a mechanism like this, re-targets the ALS code to the new interface, tested with existing ALS tests.","created_at":"2020-03-26T17:10:35Z","updated_at":"2020-04-07T20:56:23Z","closed_at":"2020-04-07T20:54:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75ea9084d1ab15195f781023426cb181ef29a248","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change types of `DateTimeTestUtils` values and functions by replacing `java.util.TimeZone` to `java.time.ZoneId`. In particular:\r\n1. Type of `ALL_TIMEZONES` is changed to `Seq[ZoneId]`.\r\n2. Remove `val outstandingTimezones: Seq[TimeZone]`.\r\n3. Change the type of the time zone parameter in `withDefaultTimeZone` to `ZoneId`.\r\n4. Modify affected test suites.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, Spark SQL's date-time expressions and functions have been already ported on Java 8 time API but tests still use old time APIs. In particular, `DateTimeTestUtils` exposes functions that accept only TimeZone instances. This is inconvenient, and CPU consuming because need to convert TimeZone instances to ZoneId instances via strings (zone ids).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy affected test suites executed by jenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new rule `RepartitionWritingDataSource` to support repartitioning before writing data.  It supports three patterns:\r\n- Repartition by none when writing normal tables/directories to reduce small files.\r\n- Repartition by dynamic partition column when writing dynamic partition tables/directories to reduce small files because a single map task may contains many dynamic partition values.\r\n- Repartition by bucket column with bucket number and sort by sort column when writing bucket tables/directories.\r\n\r\nWe only support data source tables/directories because [it cannot fully support Hive tables](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/9f7cdb89f7614ef38ba2d8877d4c0f87ad9b6f5f/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/execution/InsertIntoHiveTable.scala#L182-L188).\r\n\r\nHive has a similar rule: [SortedDynPartitionOptimizer](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/917221e8378ec48ea05ef6b6c7d9515609b8ec01/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/SortedDynPartitionOptimizer.java).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To reduce generating small files.\r\n2. To ease pressure on the NameNode and improve insert dynamic partition table/directory performance.\r\n   Spark job failed  because too many data blocks were created | HDFS data block monitor\r\n   --

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds support for metadata columns to DataSourceV2. If a source implements `SupportsMetadataColumns` it must also implement `SupportsPushDownRequiredColumns` to support projecting those columns.\r\n\r\nThe analyzer is updated to resolve metadata columns from `LogicalPlan.metadataOutput`, and this adds a rule that will add metadata columns to the output of `DataSourceV2Relation` if one is used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is the solution discussed for exposing additional data in the Kafka source. It is also needed for a generic `MERGE INTO` plan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Users can project additional columns from sources that implement the new API. This also updates `DescribeTableExec` to show metadata columns.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWill include new unit tests.","created_at":"2020-03-25T22:37:10Z","updated_at":"2020-11-24T00:19:38Z","closed_at":"2020-11-18T22:08:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb6c4fd1e2ae37b75666c12eb284a42cd7317f30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6e72f4d68e6935efba32ba7a5f8b48adb66fe145","head":{"label":"rdblue:add-dsv2-metadata-columns","ref":"add-dsv2-metadata-columns","sha":"6e72f4d68e6935efba32ba7a5f8b48adb66fe145","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Unify the create table syntax in the parser by merging Hive and DataSource clauses\r\n* Add `SerdeInfo` and `external` boolean to statement plans and update AstBuilder to produce them\r\n* Add conversion from create statement plan to v1 create plans in ResolveSessionCatalog\r\n* Support new statement clauses in ResolveCatalogs conversion to v2 create plans\r\n* Remove SparkSqlParser rules for Hive syntax\r\n* Add \"option.\" namespace to distinguish SERDEPROPERTIES and OPTIONS in table properties\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n* Current behavior is confusing.\r\n* A way to pass the Hive create options to DSv2 is needed for a Hive source.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNot by default, but v2 sources will be able to handle STORED AS and other Hive clauses.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests validate there are no behavior changes.\r\n\r\nUpdate unit tests for using a statement plan for Hive create syntax:\r\n* Move create tests from spark-sql DDLParserSuite into PlanResolutionSuite\r\n* Add parser tests to spark-catalyst

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen `toPandas` API works on duplicate column names produced from operators like join, we see the error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous. Use a.empty, a.bool(), a.item(), a.any() or a.all().\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the error in `toPandas` API.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo make `toPandas` work on dataframe with duplicate column names.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Previously calling `toPandas` API on a dataframe with duplicate column names will fail. After this patch, it will produce correct result.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to define `timestampFormatter`, `dateFormatter` and `zoneId` as methods of the `HiveResult` object. This should guarantee that the formatters pick the current session time zone in `toHiveString()`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, date/timestamp formatters in `HiveResult.toHiveString` are initialized once on instantiation of the `HiveResult` object, and pick up the session time zone. If the sessions time zone is changed, the formatters still use the previous one.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites, in particular, by `HiveResultSuite`","created_at":"2020-03-25T20:25:05Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:44Z","closed_at":"2020-03-26T09:46:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce560677b3f4cf043fb63782a19bc673ee550d8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28024/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28024/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28024/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/74b98f52b9e40d0ce63b48381e883ab6e3aed133","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:hive-result-datetime-formatters","ref":"hive-result-datetime-formatters","sha":"74b98f52b9e40d0ce63b48381e883ab6e3aed133","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRefactor `streaming-page.js` by making on-click timeline action customizable.\r\nThis is a PR backporting `SPARK-31161` to `branch-3.0`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current implementation, `streaming-page.js` is used from Streaming page and Structured Streaming page but the implementation of the on-click timeline action is strongly dependent on Streamng page.\r\nStructured Streaming page doesn't define the on-click action for now but it's better to remove the dependncy for the future.\r\n\r\nOriginally, I make this change to fix `SPARK-31128` but #27883 resolved it.\r\nSo, now this is just for refactoring.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManual tests with following code and confirmed there are no regression and no error in the debug console in Firefox.\r\n\r\nFor Structured Streaming:\r\n```\r\nspark.readStream.format(\"socket\").options(Map(\"host\"->\"localhost\", \"port\"->\"8765\")).load.writeStream.format(\"console\").start\r\n```\r\nAnd then, visited Structured Streaming page and there were no error in the debug console when I clicked a point in the timeline.\r\n\r\nFor Spark Streaming:\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.streaming._\r\nval ssc = new StreamingContext(sc, Seconds(1))\r\nssc.socketTextStream(\"localhost\", 8765)\r\ndstream.foreachRDD(rdd => rdd.foreach(println))\r\nssc.start\r\n```\r\nAnd then, visited Streaming page and confirmed scrolling down and hilighting work well and there were no error in the debug console when I clicked a point in the timeline.","created_at":"2020-03-25T15:25:43Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T20:44:31Z","closed_at":"2020-03-25T19:57:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e78fec2c564296f21e8986a20568f75b25edd899","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen loading DataFrames from JDBC datasource with Kerberos authentication, remote executors (yarn-client/cluster etc. modes) fail to establish a connection due to lack of Kerberos ticket or ability to generate it.\r\n\r\nThis is a real issue when trying to ingest data from kerberized data sources (SQL Server, Oracle) in enterprise environment where exposing simple authentication access is not an option due to IT policy issues.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've added MariaDB support (other supported databases will come in later PRs).\r\n\r\nWhat this PR contains:\r\n* Introduced `SecureConnectionProvider` and added basic secure functionalities\r\n* Added `MariaDBConnectionProvider`\r\n* Added `MariaDBConnectionProviderSuite`\r\n* Added `MariaDBKrbIntegrationSuite` docker integration test\r\n* Added some missing code documentation\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMissing JDBC kerberos support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, now user is able to connect to MariaDB using kerberos.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Additional + existing unit tests\r\n* Additional + existing integration tests\r\n* Test on cluster manually\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-25T09:53:52Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T18:44:13Z","closed_at":"2020-04-09T16:20:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92f274453d087578c956411fcdb44b348ec83b66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2740a507152b5a90fa44400ea9f0cfbcb0ddfcd5","head":{"label":"gaborgsomogyi:SPARK-31021","ref":"SPARK-31021","sha":"2740a507152b5a90fa44400ea9f0cfbcb0ddfcd5","user":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111547097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE1NDcwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"gaborgsomogyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gaborgsomogyi","id":18561820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTYxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18561820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi","html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaborgsomogyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gaborgsomogyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR (SPARK-31238) aims the followings.\r\n1. Modified ORC Vectorized Reader, in particular, OrcColumnVector v1.2 and v2.3. After the changes, it uses `DateTimeUtils. rebaseJulianToGregorianDays()` added by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27915 . The method performs rebasing days from the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian) to Proleptic Gregorian calendar. It builds a local date in the original calendar, extracts date fields `year`, `month` and `day` from the local date, and builds another local date in the target calendar. After that, it calculates days from the epoch `1970-01-01` for the resulted local date.\r\n2. Introduced rebasing dates while saving ORC files, in particular, I modified `OrcShimUtils. getDateWritable` v1.2 and v2.3, and returned `DaysWritable` instead of Hive's `DateWritable`. The `DaysWritable` class was added by the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27890 (and fixed by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27962). I moved `DaysWritable` from `sql/hive` to `sql/core` to re-use it in ORC datasource.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor the backward compatibility with Spark 2.4 and earlier versions. The changes allow users to read dates/timestamps saved by previous version, and get the same result.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before the changes, loading the date `1200-01-01` saved by Spark 2.4.5 returns the following:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.orc(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_orc\").show(false)\r\n+----------+\r\n|dt        |\r\n+----------+\r\n|1200-01-08|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\nAfter the changes\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.orc(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_orc\").show(false)\r\n+----------+\r\n|dt        |\r\n+----------+\r\n|1200-01-01|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By running `OrcSourceSuite` and `HiveOrcSourceSuite`.\r\n- Add new test `SPARK-31238: compatibility with Spark 2.4 in reading dates` to `OrcSuite` which reads an ORC file saved by Spark 2.4.5 via the commands:\r\n```shell\r\n$ export TZ=\"America/Los_Angeles\"\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"select cast('1200-01-01' as date) dt\").write.mode(\"overwrite\").orc(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_orc\")\r\nscala> spark.read.orc(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_orc\").show(false)\r\n+----------+\r\n|dt        |\r\n+----------+\r\n|1200-01-01|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n- Add round trip test `SPARK-31238: rebasing dates in write`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR (SPARK-31244) replaces `Ceph` with `Minio` in K8S `DepsTestSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `DepsTestsSuite` is using `ceph` for S3 storage. However, the used version and all new releases are broken on new `minikube` releases. We had better use more robust and small one.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ minikube version\r\nminikube version: v1.8.2\r\n\r\n$ minikube -p minikube docker-env | source\r\n\r\n$ docker run -it --rm -e NETWORK_AUTO_DETECT=4 -e RGW_FRONTEND_PORT=8000 -e SREE_PORT=5001 -e CEPH_DEMO_UID=nano -e CEPH_DAEMON=demo ceph/daemon:v4.0.3-stable-4.0-nautilus-centos-7-x86_64 /bin/sh\r\n2020-03-25 04:26:21  /opt/ceph-container/bin/entrypoint.sh: ERROR- it looks like we have not been able to discover the network settings\r\n\r\n$ docker run -it --rm -e NETWORK_AUTO_DETECT=4 -e RGW_FRONTEND_PORT=8000 -e SREE_PORT=5001 -e CEPH_DEMO_UID=nano -e CEPH_DAEMON=demo ceph/daemon:v4.0.11-stable-4.0-nautilus-centos-7 /bin/sh\r\n2020-03-25 04:20:30  /opt/ceph-container/bin/entrypoint.sh: ERROR- it looks like we have not been able to discover the network settings\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, the image size is unnecessarily big (almost `1GB`) and growing while `minio` is `55.8MB` with the same features.\r\n```\r\n$ docker images | grep ceph\r\nceph/daemon v4.0.3-stable-4.0-nautilus-centos-7-x86_64 a6a05ccdf924 6 months ago 852MB\r\nceph/daemon v4.0.11-stable-4.0-nautilus-centos-7       87f695550d8e 12 hours ago

change?\r\n\r\nNo. (This is a test case change)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the existing Jenkins K8s integration test job and test with the latest minikube.\r\n```\r\n$ minikube

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake `mergeSparkConf` in `WithTestConf` respects `spark.sql.legacy.sessionInitWithConfigDefaults`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWithout the fix, conf specified by `withSQLConf` can be reverted to original value in a cloned SparkSession.  For example, you will fail test below without the fix:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwithSQLConf(SQLConf.CODEGEN_FALLBACK.key -> \"true\") {\r\n  val cloned = spark.cloneSession()\r\n  SparkSession.setActiveSession(cloned)\r\n  assert(SQLConf.get.getConf(SQLConf.CODEGEN_FALLBACK) === true)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we should fix it just as  #24540 did before.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-25T06:10:41Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T12:03:44Z","closed_at":"2020-03-26T10:53:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f39f7528cb2b1828cad95b529846ca9fc78ba4ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28014/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28014/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28014/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c37fc774d9d92bf475b524a5e789ed00d075b802","head":{"label":"Ngone51:sparksession_clone","ref":"sparksession_clone","sha":"c37fc774d9d92bf475b524a5e789ed00d075b802","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds `spark.yarn.applicationType` to identify the application type\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current application defaults to the SPARK type. \r\nIn fact, different types of applications have different characteristics and are suitable for different scenarios.For example: SPAKR-SQL, SPARK-STREAMING.\r\nI recommend distinguishing them by the parameter `spark.yarn.applicationType` so that we can more easily manage and maintain different types of applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1.add UT\r\n2.Tested by verifying Yarn-UI `ApplicationType` in the following cases:\r\n- client and cluster mode\r\n\r\nNeed additional explanation:\r\nlimit cannot exceed 20 characters, can be empty or space\r\nThe reasons are as follows:\r\n```    \r\n// org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.submitApplication.\r\n if (submissionContext.getApplicationType() == null) {\r\n      submissionContext\r\n        .setApplicationType(YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_APPLICATION_TYPE);\r\n} else {\r\n      // APPLICATION_TYPE_LENGTH = 20\r\n      if (submissionContext.getApplicationType().length() > YarnConfiguration.APPLICATION_TYPE_LENGTH) {\r\n        submissionContext.setApplicationType(submissionContext\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nConstant fold deterministic Scala UDFs with foldable arguments, conservatively.\r\n`ScalaUDF`s that meet all following criteria are subject to constant folding in this PR:\r\n- deterministic\r\n- all arguments are foldable\r\n- does not throw an exception when evaluating the UDF for constant folding\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is an optimization that enables more constant folding, improving the performance of a special case of Scala UDFs.\r\n\r\nCatalyst already implements constant folding of expressions in a few places, through the pattern `if (e.foldable) e.eval(EmptyRow)`. One of the optimizer rules that specifically performs constant folding is `ConstantFolding`.\r\n\r\n`ScalaUDF` does not override `foldable`, so it isn't subject to constant folding right now.\r\n\r\nTo enable constant folding of `ScalaUDF`s, it's tempting to make it override `foldable`:\r\n```scala\r\n  override lazy val foldable: Boolean = deterministic && children.forall(_.foldable)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut `ScalaUDF`s are declared as deterministic by default, so it's possible for users to mis-declare a potentially exception-throwing UDF as deterministic, so for callers of the \"constant folding\" code pattern that do not expect an exception, overriding `ScalaUDF.foldable` in general may have a wide impact.\r\n\r\nInstead, this PR tackles the problem in a conservative way, where the constant folding of `ScalaUDF`s is only implemented in the `ConstantFolding` rule, with special handling to catch non-fatal exceptions when evaluating a Scala UDF during constant folding and skip folding such UDFs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nCaveat: this PR assumes certain semantics of `Expression.deterministic`. Although it guards against potentially exception-throwing Scala UDFs being mis-declared as deterministic, it cannot guard against other kinds of mis-declarations, e.g.\r\n- UDFs that are only expected to be invoked on executors;\r\n- UDFs that return the same value but have other side-effects, such as modifying a static field.\r\nUsers should explicitly mark such UDFs as `asNondeterministic`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test case in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`HiveResult` performs some conversions for commands to be compatible with Hive output, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n// If it is a describe command for a Hive table, we want to have the output format be similar with Hive.\r\ncase ExecutedCommandExec(_: DescribeCommandBase) =>\r\n...\r\n// SHOW TABLES in Hive only output table names, while ours output database, table name, isTemp.\r\ncase command @ ExecutedCommandExec(s: ShowTablesCommand) if !s.isExtended =>\r\n```\r\nThis conversion is needed for DatasourceV2 commands as well and this PR proposes to add the conversion for v2 commands `SHOW TABLES` and `DESCRIBE TABLE`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug where conversion is not applied to v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the outputs for v2 commands `SHOW TABLES` and `DESCRIBE TABLE` are compatible with HIVE output.\r\n\r\nFor example, with a table created as:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE testcat.ns.tbl (id bigint COMMENT 'col1') USING foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output of `SHOW TABLES` has changed from\r\n```\r\nns    table\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\ntable\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the output of `DESCRIBE TABLE` has changed from\r\n```\r\nid    bigint    col1\r\n\r\n# Partitioning        \r\nNot partitioned        \r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\nid                      bigint                  col1                \r\n                                                                           \r\n# Partitioning                                                    \r\nNot partitioned                                                 \r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add a few `ZoneId` constant values to the `DateTimeTestUtils` object, and reuse the constants in tests. Proposed the following constants:\r\n- PST = -08:00\r\n- UTC = +00:00\r\n- CEST = +02:00\r\n- CET = +01:00\r\n- JST = +09:00\r\n- MIT = -09:30\r\n- LA = America/Los_Angeles\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAll proposed constant values (except `LA`) are initialized by zone offsets according to their definitions. This will allow to avoid:\r\n- Using of 3-letter time zones that have been already deprecated in JDK, see _Three-letter time zone IDs_ in https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html\r\n- Incorrect mapping of 3-letter time zones to zone offsets, see SPARK-31237. For example, `PST` is mapped to `America/Los_Angeles` instead of the `-08:00` zone offset.\r\n\r\nAlso this should improve stability and maintainability of test suites.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running affected test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is backport of #27185 to branch-2.4.\r\n\r\nThe cached RDD for plan \"select 1\" stays in memory forever until the session close. This cached data cannot be used since the view temp1 has been replaced by another plan. It's a memory leak.\r\n\r\nWe can reproduce by below commands:\r\n```\r\nWelcome to\r\n      ____              __\r\n     / __/__  ___ _____/ /__\r\n    _\\ \\/ _ \\/ _ `/ __/  '_/\r\n   /___/

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to update the doc for `spark.sql.session.timeZone`, and restrict format of config's values to 2 forms:\r\n1. Geographical regions, such as `America/Los_Angeles`.\r\n2. Fixed offsets - a fully resolved offset from UTC. For example, `-08:00`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOther formats such as three-letter time zone IDs are ambitious, and depend on the locale. For example, `CST` could be U.S. `Central Standard Time` and `China Standard Time`. Such formats have been already deprecated in JDK, see [Three-letter time zone IDs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running `./dev/scalastyle`, and manual testing.","created_at":"2020-03-24T08:44:19Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:42Z","closed_at":"2020-03-25T08:33:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"23301fb993e7c53b51be6f2a102eb3303c7be0d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27999/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27999/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27999/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b729f5c2e803dee2e94b0733fd91f5ff7cd7cc70","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:doc-session-time-zone","ref":"doc-session-time-zone","sha":"b729f5c2e803dee2e94b0733fd91f5ff7cd7cc70","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nClose idle connections at shuffle server side when an `IdleStateEvent` is triggered after `spark.shuffle.io.connectionTimeout` or `spark.network.timeout` time. It's based on following investigations.\r\n\r\n1. We found connections on our clusters building up continuously (> 10k for some nodes). Is that normal ? We don't think so.\r\n2. We looked into the connections on one node and found there were a lot of half-open connections. (connections only existed on one node)\r\n3. We also checked those connections were very old (> 21 hours). (FYI, https://superuser.com/questions/565991/how-to-determine-the-socket-connection-up-time-on-linux)\r\n4. Looking at the code, TransportContext registers an IdleStateHandler which should fire an IdleStateEvent when timeout. We did a heap dump of the YarnShuffleService and checked the attributes of IdleStateHandler. It turned out firstAllIdleEvent of many IdleStateHandlers were already false so IdleStateEvent were already fired.\r\n5. Finally, we realized the IdleStateEvent would not be handled since closeIdleConnections are hardcoded to false for YarnShuffleService.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIdle connections to YarnShuffleService could never be closed, and will be accumulating and taking up memory and file descriptors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-24T07:42:56Z","updated_at":"2020-03-30T17:46:19Z","closed_at":"2020-03-30T17:45:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20b7682e26285d6f62ffc6232c1d94e43397c29b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e3b157daf659618e4c7bf3d2a7200c1660d6015c","head":{"label":"manuzhang:spark-31219","ref":"spark-31219","sha":"e3b157daf659618e4c7bf3d2a7200c1660d6015c","user":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132739917,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzI3Mzk5MTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"manuzhang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"manuzhang","id":1191767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manuzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/manuzhang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR(SPARK-31101) proposes to upgrade Janino to 3.0.16 which is released recently.\r\n\r\n* Merged pull request janino-compiler/janino#114 \"Grow the code for relocatables, and do fixup, and relocate\".\r\n\r\nPlease see the commit log.\r\n- https://github.com/janino-compiler/janino/commits/3.0.16\r\n\r\nYou can see the changelog from the link: http://janino-compiler.github.io/janino/changelog.html / though release note for Janino 3.0.16 is actually incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe got some report on failure on user's query which Janino throws error on compiling generated code. The issue is here: janino-compiler/janino#113 It contains the information of generated code, symptom (error), and analysis of the bug, so please refer the link for more details.\r\nJanino 3.0.16 contains the PR janino-compiler/janino#114 which would enable Janino to succeed to compile user's query properly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UTs.\r\n\r\nBelow test code fails on branch-2.4 and passes with this patch.\r\n\r\n(Note that there seems to be the case where another UT affects this UT to not fail - adding this to SQLQuerySuite won't fail this UT, but adding this to DateFunctionsSuite will fail this UT, and if you run this UT solely in SQLQuerySuite via `build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *.SQLQuerySuite -- -z SPARK-31115\"` then it fails.)\r\n\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * NOTE: The test code tries to control the size of for/switch statement in expand_doConsume,\r\n   * as well as the overall size of expand_doConsume, so that the query triggers known Janino\r\n   * bug - https://github.com/janino-compiler/janino/issues/113.\r\n   *\r\n   * The expected exception message from Janino when we use switch statement for \"ExpandExec\":\r\n   * - \"Operand stack inconsistent at offset xxx: Previous size 1, now 0\"\r\n   * which will not happen when we use if-else-if statement for \"ExpandExec\".\r\n   *\r\n   * \"The number of fields\" and \"The number of distinct aggregation functions\" are the major\r\n   * factors to increase the size of generated code: while these values should be large enough\r\n   * to trigger the Janino bug, these values should not also too big; otherwise one of below\r\n   * exceptions might be thrown:\r\n   * - \"expand_doConsume would be beyond 64KB\"\r\n   * - \"java.lang.ClassFormatError: Too many arguments in method signature in class file\"\r\n   */\r\n  test(\"SPARK-31115 Lots of columns and distinct aggregations shouldn't break code

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR(SPARK-31101) proposes to upgrade Janino to 3.0.16 which is released recently.\r\n\r\n* Merged pull request janino-compiler/janino#114 \"Grow the code for relocatables, and do fixup, and relocate\".\r\n\r\nPlease see the commit log.\r\n- https://github.com/janino-compiler/janino/commits/3.0.16\r\n\r\nYou can see the changelog from the link: http://janino-compiler.github.io/janino/changelog.html / though release note for Janino 3.0.16 is actually incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe got some report on failure on user's query which Janino throws error on compiling generated code. The issue is here: janino-compiler/janino#113 It contains the information of generated code, symptom (error), and analysis of the bug, so please refer the link for more details.\r\nJanino 3.0.16 contains the PR janino-compiler/janino#114 which would enable Janino to succeed to compile user's query properly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UTs.\r\n\r\nBelow test code fails on branch-3.0 and passes with this patch.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * NOTE: The test code tries to control the size of for/switch statement in expand_doConsume,\r\n   * as well as the overall size of expand_doConsume, so that the query triggers known Janino\r\n   * bug - https://github.com/janino-compiler/janino/issues/113.\r\n   *\r\n   * The expected exception message from Janino when we use switch statement for \"ExpandExec\":\r\n   * - \"Operand stack inconsistent at offset xxx: Previous size 1, now 0\"\r\n   * which will not happen when we use if-else-if statement for \"ExpandExec\".\r\n   *\r\n   * \"The number of fields\" and \"The number of distinct aggregation functions\" are the major\r\n   * factors to increase the size of generated code: while these values should be large enough\r\n   * to trigger the Janino bug, these values should not also too big; otherwise one of below\r\n   * exceptions might be thrown:\r\n   * - \"expand_doConsume would be beyond 64KB\"\r\n   * - \"java.lang.ClassFormatError: Too many arguments in method signature

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor a bit of background,\r\nPIP packaging test started to fail (see [this logs](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/120218/testReport/)) as of  setuptools 46.1.0 release. In https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1424, they decided to don't keep the modes in `package_data`.\r\n\r\nIn PySpark pip installation, we keep the executable scripts in `package_data` https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fc4e56a54c15e20baf085e6061d3d83f5ce1185d/python/setup.py#L199-L200, and expose their symbolic links as executable scripts.\r\n\r\nSo, the symbolic links (or copied scripts) executes the scripts copied from `package_data`, which doesn't have the executable permission in its mode:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/tmp/tmp.UmkEGNFdKF/3.6/bin/spark-submit: line 27: /tmp/tmp.UmkEGNFdKF/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyspark/bin/spark-class: Permission denied\r\n/tmp/tmp.UmkEGNFdKF/3.6/bin/spark-submit: line 27: exec: /tmp/tmp.UmkEGNFdKF/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyspark/bin/spark-class: cannot execute: Permission denied\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current issue is being tracked at https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2041\r\n\r\n</br>\r\n\r\nFor what this PR proposes:\r\nIt sets the setuptools version in PR builder for now to unblock other PRs.  _This PR does not solve the issue yet_. I will make a fix after monitoring https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2041\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt currently affects users who uses the latest setuptools. So, _users seem unable to use PySpark with the latest setuptools._ See also https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2041#issuecomment-602566667\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt makes CI pass for now. No user-facing change yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins will test.","created_at":"2020-03-24T02:03:36Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T07:45:03Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T08:59:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d712a0d838ff4b967753b92c23db5d89c5daea1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27995/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27995/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27995/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b8926bd63441c49c6c14fe87456036fc74340c4e","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:investigate-pip-packaging","ref":"investigate-pip-packaging","sha":"b8926bd63441c49c6c14fe87456036fc74340c4e","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCreate statement plans in `DataFrameWriter(V2)`, like the SQL API.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes a wrong behavior when creating v2 tables: the OPTIONS is the table options, not the write options.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's better to leave all the resolution work to the analyzer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets for non-nullable null type not to coerce to nullable type in complex types.\r\n\r\nNon-nullable fields in struct, elements in an array and entries in map can mean empty array, struct and map. They are empty so it does not need to force the nullability when we find common types.\r\n\r\nThis PR also reverts and supersedes https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/d7b97a1d0daf65710317321490a833f696a46f21\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make type coercion coherent and consistent. Currently, we correctly keep the nullability even between non-nullable fields:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nspark.range(1).select(array(lit(1)).cast(ArrayType(IntegerType, false))).printSchema()\r\nspark.range(1).select(array(lit(1)).cast(ArrayType(DoubleType, false))).printSchema()\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(1).selectExpr(\"concat(array(1), array(1)) as arr\").printSchema()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nspark.range(1).select(array().cast(ArrayType(IntegerType, false))).printSchema()\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(1).selectExpr(\"concat(array(), array(1)) as arr\").printSchema()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve 'array()' due to data type mismatch: cannot cast array<null> to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR (SPARK-31229) is rather a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27926 (SPARK-31166). It adds unittests for `TypeCoercion.findTypeForComplex` and `Cast.canCast` about struct, map and array with the respect to null types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo detect which scope was broken in the future easily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's a test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n * Renamed  hive transform scrip class `hive/execution/ScriptTransformationExec` to `hive/execution/HiveScriptTransformationExec` (don't rename file)\r\n * Extract class `BaseScriptTransformationExec ` about common code used across `SparkScriptTransformationExec(next pr add this)` and `HiveScriptTransformationExec`\r\n * Extract class `BaseScriptTransformationWriterThread` of writing data thread across `SparkScriptTransformationWriterThread(added next for support transform in sql/core )`  and  `HiveScriptTransformationWriterThread` ,  \r\n * `HiveScriptTransformationWriterThread` additionally supports Hive serde format\r\n * Rename current `Script` strategies in hive module to `HiveScript`, in next pr will add `SparkScript` strategies for support transform in sql/core.\r\n\r\nTodo List;\r\n\r\n- Support transform in sql/core base on `BaseScriptTransformationExec`, which would run script operator in SQL mode (without Hive).\r\nThe output of script would be read as a string and column values are extracted by using a delimiter (default : tab character)\r\n- For Hive, by default only serde's must be used, and without hive we can run without serde\r\n- Cleanup past hacks that are observed (and people suggest / report)， such as\r\n       - [Solve string value error about Date/Timestamp in ScriptTransform](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31947)\r\n       - [support use transform with aggregation](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28227)\r\n       - [support array/map as transform's input](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22435)\r\n- Use code-gen projection to serialize rows to output stream()\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to apply rebasing for all dates/timestamps in conversion functions `fromJavaDate()`, `toJavaDate()`, `toJavaTimestamp()` and `fromJavaTimestamp()`. The rebasing is performed via building a local date-time in an original calendar, extracting date-time fields from the result, and creating new local date-time in the target calendar.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are need to be compatible with previous Spark version (2.4.5 and earlier versions) not only before the Gregorian cutover date `1582-10-15` but also for dates after the date. For instance, Gregorian calendar implementation in Java 7 `java.util.GregorianCalendar` is not accurate in resolving time zone offsets as Gregorian calendar introduced since Java 8.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR can introduce behavior changes for dates after `1582-10-15`, in particular conversions of zone ids to zone offsets will be much more accurate. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite`, `DateExpressionsSuite`, `CollectionExpressionsSuite`, `HiveOrcHadoopFsRelationSuite`, `ParquetIOSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-22T11:38:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:41Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T13:14:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a23faecf3f74380713ea494fdf6b128223b1367f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27980/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27980/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27980/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/46b6613e4025f91487ce58e09cf0a1bccb17897e","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:reuse-rebase-funcs-in-java-funcs","ref":"reuse-rebase-funcs-in-java-funcs","sha":"46b6613e4025f91487ce58e09cf0a1bccb17897e","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix the issue of rebasing leap years in Julian calendar to Proleptic Gregorian calendar in which the years are not leap years. In the Julian calendar, every four years is a leap year, with a leap day added to the month of February. In Proleptic Gregorian calendar, every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years, if they are exactly divisible by 400. In this ways, the date **1000-02-29** exists in the Julian calendar but not in Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\r\n\r\nI modified the `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` and `rebaseJulianToGregorianDays()` in `DateTimeUtils` by passing 1 as a day number of month while forming `LocalDate` or `LocalDateTime`, and adding the number of days using the `plusDays()` method. For example, **1000-02-29** doesn't exist in Proleptic Gregorian calendar, and `LocalDate.of(1000, 2, 29)` throws an exception. To avoid the issue, I build the `LocalDate.of(1000, 2, 1)` date and add 28 days. The `plusDays(28)` method produces the next valid date after `1000-02-28` which is **1000-03-01**.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore the changes, the `java.time.DateTimeException` exception is raised while loading the date `1000-02-29` from parquet files saved by Spark 2.4.5:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.parquet.rebaseDateTime.enabled\", true)\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_leap\").show\r\n20/03/21 03:03:59 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 3.0 (TID 3)\r\njava.time.DateTimeException: Invalid date 'February 29' as '1000' is not a leap year\r\n```\r\nThe parquet files were saved via the commands:\r\n```shell\r\n$ export TZ=\"America/Los_Angeles\"\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nscala> scala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"America/Los_Angeles\")\r\nscala> val df = Seq(java.sql.Date.valueOf(\"1000-02-29\")).toDF(\"dateS\").select($\"dateS\".as(\"date\"))\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [date: date]\r\nscala> df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_leap\")\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_leap\").show\r\n+----------+\r\n|      date|\r\n+----------+\r\n|1000-02-29|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, after the fix:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"America/Los_Angeles\")\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.parquet.rebaseDateTime.enabled\", true)\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_leap\").show\r\n+----------+\r\n|      date|\r\n+----------+\r\n|1000-03-01|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `DateTimeUtilsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-21T10:07:18Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:40Z","closed_at":"2020-03-23T06:21:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d3e95df52bc11d50276c2f6b5da8b6c6e9d54055","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27974/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27974/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27974/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2cf2e8ddf095ee52ba8c1875a4683968e325fcf5","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:julian-date-29-feb","ref":"julian-date-29-feb","sha":"2cf2e8ddf095ee52ba8c1875a4683968e325fcf5","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to refactor reading of timestamps of the `TIMESTAMP_MILLIS` logical type from Parquet files in `VectorizedColumnReader`, and move checking of the `rebaseDateTime` flag out of the internal loop.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid any additional overhead of the checking the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.rebaseDateTime.enabled` introduced by the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27915.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the test suite `ParquetIOSuite`.","created_at":"2020-03-20T19:02:17Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:39Z","closed_at":"2020-03-23T14:02:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bbc9fdb2f5418eec736d1487c418f9243f01bddf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50120608897b22fb13ed05f975941e492d215af3","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:rebase-parquet-datetime-followup","ref":"rebase-parquet-datetime-followup","sha":"50120608897b22fb13ed05f975941e492d215af3","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake it always compile a Subquery(even with the same `exprId`) in `InsertAdaptiveSparkPlan. buildSubqueryMap` when reuse subquery is off.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, in `InsertAdaptiveSparkPlan. buildSubqueryMap`, it will skip compiling a subquery when it has same `exprId` with a compiled subquery. And this leads to use the same `SubqueryExec` for the `SubqueryExpression` with the same `exprId`. Thus, the behavior here is not consistent compare to `PlanSubqueries` without AQE.\r\n\r\nHere's an example for the issue(please note the difference of subquery plan #id):\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"set spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=true\")\r\nspark.sql(\"set spark.sql.execution.reuseSubquery=false\")\r\nspark.sql( \"select b as b1, b as b2 from (select a, (select b from t2 where b = 51) b from t1)\").queryExecution.executedPlan\r\n\r\n/** Before **/\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan(isFinalPlan=false)\r\n+- Project [Subquery subquery34, [id=#57] AS b1#36L, Subquery subquery34, [id=#57] AS b2#37L]\r\n   :  :- Subquery subquery34, [id=#57]\r\n   :  :  +- AdaptiveSparkPlan(isFinalPlan=false)\r\n   :  :     +- Project [id#4L AS b#6L]\r\n   :  :        +- Filter (id#4L = 51)\r\n   :  :           +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=16)\r\n   :  +- Subquery subquery34, [id=#57]\r\n   :     +- AdaptiveSparkPlan(isFinalPlan=false)\r\n   :        +- Project [id#4L AS b#6L]\r\n   :           +- Filter (id#4L = 51)\r\n   :              +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=16)\r\n   +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=16)\r\n\r\n/** After **/\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan(isFinalPlan=false)\r\n+- Project [Subquery subquery28, [id=#28] AS b1#30L, Subquery subquery28, [id=#38] AS b2#31L]\r\n   :  :- Subquery subquery28, [id=#28]\r\n   :  :  +- AdaptiveSparkPlan(isFinalPlan=false)\r\n   :  :     +- Project [id#20L AS b#22L]\r\n   :  :        +- Filter (id#20L = 51)\r\n   :  :           +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=16)\r\n   :  +- Subquery subquery28, [id=#38]\r\n   :     +- AdaptiveSparkPlan(isFinalPlan=false)\r\n   :        +- Project [id#20L AS b#22L]\r\n   :           +- Filter (id#20L = 51)\r\n   :              +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=16)\r\n   +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=16)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark CLI, we create a hive `CliSessionState` and it does not load the `hive-site.xml`. So the configurations in `hive-site.xml` will not take effects like other spark-hive integration apps.\r\n\r\nAlso, the warehouse directory is not correctly picked. If the `default` database does not exist, the `CliSessionState` will create one during the first time it talks to the metastore. The `Location` of the default DB will be neither the value of `spark.sql.warehousr.dir` nor the user-specified value of `hive.metastore.warehourse.dir`, but the default value of `hive.metastore.warehourse.dir `which will always be `/user/hive/warehouse`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes CLiSuite failure with the hive-1.2 profile in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27933.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27933, we fix the issue in JIRA by deciding the warehouse dir using all properties from spark conf and Hadoop conf, but properties from `--hiveconf` is not included,  they will be applied to the `CliSessionState` instance after it initialized. When this command-line option key is `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir`, the actual warehouse dir is overridden. Because of the logic in Hive for creating the non-existing default database changed, that test passed with `Hive 2.3.6` but failed with `1.2`. So in this PR, Hadoop/Hive configurations are ordered by:\r\n` spark.hive.xxx > spark.hadoop.xxx > --hiveconf xxx > hive-site.xml` througth `ShareState.loadHiveConfFile` before sessionState start\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBugfix for Spark SQL CLI to pick right confs\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, \r\n1. the non-exists default database will be created in the location specified by the users via `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` or `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir`, or the default value of `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` if none of them specified.\r\n\r\n2. configurations from `hive-site.xml` will not override command-line options or the properties defined with `spark.hadoo(hive).` prefix in spark conf.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, spark's memory management depends on the size estimation for execution and storage.\r\nIn our real cluster, users always meet the issue OOM due to the inaccurate size estimation for ` AppendOnlyMap`, that's because spark stores `KV` in an `Array[AnyRef]` in `AppendOnlyMap` for memory locality, and this value can be `CompactBuffer[_]` or `Array[CompactBuffer[_]]` for transformation like cogroup/join/groupBy, but current `SizeEstimator` will still treat this special array as an normal array, so in many cases, we noticed a great bias between the estimated size and the acutal memory consuption.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose to improve the estimation for `AppendOnlyMap` when the value type is `CompactBuffer`/`Array[CompactBuffer]`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprovements and can avoid OOM for many cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UT & Added

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSkew join handling comes with an overhead: we need to read some data repeatedly. We should treat a partition as skewed if it's large enough so that it's beneficial to do so.\r\n\r\nCurrently the size threshold is the advisory partition size, which is 64 MB by default. This is not large enough for the skewed partition size threshold.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new config for the threshold and set default value as 256 MB.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid skew join handling that may introduce a  perf regression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26412 introduced a behavior change that `date_add`/`date_sub` functions can't accept string and double values in the second parameter. This is reasonable as it's error-prone to cast string/double to int at runtime.\r\n\r\nHowever, using string literals as function arguments is very common in SQL databases. To avoid breaking valid use cases that the string literal is indeed an integer, this PR proposes to add ansi_cast for string literal in date_add/date_sub functions. If the string value is not a valid integer, we fail at query compiling time because of constant folding.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\navoid breaking changes\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now 3.0 can run `date_add('2011-11-11', '1')` like 2.4\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew tests.","created_at":"2020-03-20T08:52:18Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T04:07:52Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T04:07:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7cd461ed4a9eb30254128798b57b6d84f6fa686","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27965/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27965/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27965/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bd6be1620d54e4e5ac65f6f9b930af9ccd604997","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:string","ref":"string","sha":"bd6be1620d54e4e5ac65f6f9b930af9ccd604997","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. The tests added by #27953 are moved from `AvroLogicalTypeSuite` to `AvroSuite`.\r\n2. Checking of the `rebaseDateTime` flag is moved out from functions bodies.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The tests are moved because they are not directly related to logical types.\r\n2. Checking the flag out of functions bodies should improve performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running Avro tests via

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to correct and re-use functions from `DateTimeUtils` for rebasing days before the cutover day `1582-10-15` in `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.DaysWritable`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n0. Existing rebasing of days in `DaysWritable` is not correct.\r\n1. To deduplicate code in `DaysWritable`\r\n2. To use functions that are better tested and cross checked by loading dates/timestamps from Parquet/Avro files written by Spark 2.4.5 \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThis PR can introduce behavior change because the replaced code is different from the re-used code from `DateTimeUtils`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suite, for instance

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23248 which seems mistakenly not backported.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22104 at Spark 2.4.0.\r\n\r\nWhen we have Python UDF in subquery, we will hit an exception\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.AttributeReference cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.PythonUDF\r\n\tat scala.collection.immutable.Stream.map(Stream.scala:414)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.python.EvalPythonExec.$anonfun$doExecute$2(EvalPythonExec.scala:98)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.$anonfun$mapPartitions$2(RDD.scala:815)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22104 turned `ExtractPythonUDFs` from a physical rule to optimizer rule. However, there is a difference between a physical rule and optimizer rule. A physical rule always runs once, an optimizer rule may be applied twice on a query tree even the rule is located in a batch that only runs once.\r\n\r\nFor a subquery, the `OptimizeSubqueries` rule will execute the entire optimizer on the query plan inside subquery. Later on subquery will be turned to joins, and the optimizer rules will be applied to it again.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the `ExtractPythonUDFs` rule is not idempotent. When it's applied twice on a query plan inside subquery, it will produce a malformed plan. It extracts Python UDF from Python exec plans.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes 2 changes to be double safe:\r\n1. `ExtractPythonUDFs` should skip python exec plans, to make the rule idempotent\r\n2. `ExtractPythonUDFs` should skip subquery\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImprove `ScalaReflection` to only don't erasure non user defined `AnyVal` type, but still erasure other types, e.g. `Any`. And this brings two benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Give better encode error message for some unsupported types, e.g. `Any`\r\n\r\n2. Won't miss the walk path for the `AnyVal` type\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFirstly, PR #15284 added encode(serializeFor/deserializeFor) support for value class, which extends `AnyVal`, by not erasure types. But, this also introduce a problem that when user try to encoder unsupported types, e.g. `Any`, it will fail on `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: scala.Any` due to the reason that `scala.Any` doesn't erasure to `java.lang.Object`.\r\n\r\nAlso, in current `getClassNameFromType()`, it always erasure types which could missing walked path for user defined `AnyVal` types.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. For the test below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase class Bar(i: Any)\r\ncase class Foo(i: Bar) extends AnyVal\r\n\r\ntest() {\r\n  implicitly[ExpressionEncoder[Foo]]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: scala.Any\r\n at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:382)\r\n at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:418)\r\n at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:355)\r\n ...\r\n````\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: No Encoder found for Any\r\n - field (class: \"java.lang.Object\", name: \"i\")\r\n - field (class: \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.Bar\", name: \"i\")\r\n - root class: \"org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.Foo\"\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.ScalaReflection$.$anonfun$serializerFor$1(ScalaReflection.scala:561)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit test and test

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's a refactoring change.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark SQL's whole-stage codegen (WSCG) supports dumping the generated code to help with debugging. One way to get the generated code is through `df.queryExecution.debug.codegen`, or SQL `EXPLAIN CODEGEN` statement.\r\n\r\nThe generated code is currently printed without specific ordering, which can make debugging a bit annoying. This PR makes a minor improvement to sort the codegen dump by the `codegenStageId`, ascending.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the following query:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.range(10).agg(sum('id)).queryExecution.debug.codegen\r\n```\r\nwill always dump the generated code in a natural, stable order. A version of this example with shorter output is:\r\n```\r\nspark.range(10).agg(sum('id)).queryExecution.debug.codegenToSeq.map(_._1).foreach(println)\r\n*(1) HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[partial_sum(id#8L)], output=[sum#15L])\r\n+- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=16)\r\n\r\n*(2) HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[sum(id#8L)], output=[sum(id)#12L])\r\n+- Exchange SinglePartition, true, [id=#30]\r\n   +- *(1) HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[partial_sum(id#8L)], output=[sum#15L])\r\n      +- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=16)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe number of codegen stages within a single SQL query tends to be very small, most likely < 50, so the overhead of adding the sorting shouldn't be significant.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMinor improvement to aid WSCG debugging.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo user-facing change for end-users; minor change for developers who debug WSCG generated code.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested the output; all other tests still pass.","created_at":"2020-03-19T06:32:11Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T11:57:15Z","closed_at":"2020-03-19T11:53:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"201ac089c0d388e9f81f9ab83e8981a13aca42a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27955/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27955/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27955/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c64b778401562ecd9022790cee7e51749d9b5f8e","head":{"label":"rednaxelafx:codegen","ref":"codegen","sha":"c64b778401562ecd9022790cee7e51749d9b5f8e","user":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89513466,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTUxMzQ2Ng==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"rednaxelafx/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rednaxelafx","id":107834,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzgzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx","html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rednaxelafx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rednaxelafx/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplement a Feature selector that removes all low-variance features. Features with a\r\nvariance lower than the threshold will be removed. The default is to keep all features with non-zero variance, i.e. remove the features that have the same value in all samples.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nVarianceThreshold is a simple baseline approach to feature selection. It removes all features whose variance doesn’t meet some threshold. The idea is when a feature doesn’t vary much within itself, it generally has very little predictive power.\r\nscikit has implemented this selector. \r\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#variance-threshold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR addresses the issue of compatibility with Spark 2.4 and earlier version in reading/writing dates and timestamp via **Avro** datasource. Previous releases are based on a hybrid calendar - Julian + Gregorian. Since Spark 3.0, Proleptic Gregorian calendar is used by default, see SPARK-26651. In particular, the issue pops up for dates/timestamps before 1582-10-15 when the hybrid calendar switches from/to Gregorian to/from Julian calendar. The same local date in different calendar is converted to different number of days since the epoch 1970-01-01. For example, the 1001-01-01 date is converted to:\r\n- -719164 in Julian calendar. Spark 2.4 saves the number as a value of DATE type into **Avro** files.\r\n- -719162 in Proleptic Gregorian calendar. Spark 3.0 saves the number as a date value.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes rebasing from/to Proleptic Gregorian calendar to the hybrid one under the SQL config:\r\n```\r\nspark.sql.legacy.avro.rebaseDateTime.enabled\r\n```\r\nwhich is set to `false` by default which means the rebasing is not performed by default.\r\n\r\nThe details of the implementation:\r\n1. Re-use 2 methods of `DateTimeUtils` added by the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27915 for rebasing microseconds. \r\n2. Re-use 2 methods of `DateTimeUtils` added by the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27915 for rebasing days. \r\n3. Use `rebaseGregorianToJulianMicros()` and `rebaseGregorianToJulianDays()` while saving timestamps/dates to **Avro** files if the SQL config is on.\r\n4. Use `rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()` and `rebaseJulianToGregorianDays()` while loading timestamps/dates from **Avro** files if the SQL config is on.\r\n5. The SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.avro.rebaseDateTime.enabled` controls conversions from/to dates, and timestamps of the `timestamp-millis`, `timestamp-micros` logical types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor the backward compatibility with Spark 2.4 and earlier versions. The changes allow users to read dates/timestamps saved by previous version, and get the same result. Also after the changes, users can enable the rebasing in write, and save dates/timestamps that can be loaded correctly by Spark 2.4 and earlier versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, the timestamp `1001-01-01 01:02:03.123456` saved by Spark 2.4.5 as `timestamp-micros` is interpreted by Spark 3.0.0-preview2 differently:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"America/Los_Angeles\")\r\nscala> spark.read.format(\"avro\").load(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_avro\").show(false)\r\n+----------+\r\n|date      |\r\n+----------+\r\n|1001-01-07|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\nAfter the changes:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.avro.rebaseDateTime.enabled\", true)\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"America/Los_Angeles\")\r\n\r\nscala> spark.read.format(\"avro\").load(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_avro\").show(false)\r\n+----------+\r\n|date      |\r\n+----------+\r\n|1001-01-01|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Added tests to `AvroLogicalTypeSuite` to check rebasing in read. The test reads back avro files saved by Spark 2.4.5 via:\r\n```shell\r\n$ export TZ=\"America/Los_Angeles\"\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"America/Los_Angeles\")\r\nscala> val df = Seq(\"1001-01-01\").toDF(\"dateS\").select($\"dateS\".cast(\"date\").as(\"date\"))\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [date: date]\r\nscala> df.write.format(\"avro\").save(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_date_avro\")\r\n\r\nscala> val df2 = Seq(\"1001-01-01 01:02:03.123456\").toDF(\"tsS\").select($\"tsS\".cast(\"timestamp\").as(\"ts\"))\r\ndf2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [ts: timestamp]\r\nscala> df2.write.format(\"avro\").save(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_ts_avro\")\r\n\r\nscala> :paste\r\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\r\n\r\n  val timestampSchema = s\"\"\"\r\n    |  {\r\n    |    \"namespace\": \"logical\",\r\n    |    \"type\": \"record\",\r\n    |    \"name\": \"test\",\r\n    |    \"fields\": [\r\n    |      {\"name\": \"ts\", \"type\": [\"null\", {\"type\": \"long\",\"logicalType\": \"timestamp-millis\"}], \"default\": null}\r\n    |    ]\r\n    |  }\r\n    |\"\"\".stripMargin\r\n\r\n// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.\r\nscala> df3.write.format(\"avro\").option(\"avroSchema\", timestampSchema).save(\"/Users/maxim/tmp/before_1582/2_4_5_ts_millis_avro\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Added the following tests to `AvroLogicalTypeSuite` to check rebasing of dates/timestamps (in microsecond and millisecond precision). The tests write rebased a date/timestamps and read them back w/ enabled/disabled rebasing, and compare results. :\r\n  - `rebasing microseconds timestamps in write`\r\n  - `rebasing milliseconds timestamps in write`\r\n  - `rebasing dates in write`","created_at":"2020-03-18T18:36:35Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:46:26Z","closed_at":"2020-03-20T05:58:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f9745651db01a6a403859bb97f01259724c8527","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2464c905045856fdbf17d2765ae499b96f912621","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:rebase-avro-datetime","ref":"rebase-avro-datetime","sha":"2464c905045856fdbf17d2765ae499b96f912621","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

For those hive versions don't support this API, `UnsupportedOperationException` will be thrown. And the upper logic should catch the exception and fallback to the filter solution mentioned above.\r\n\r\nSince the JDK11 related fix in `Hive` is not released yet, manual tests against hive 2.3.7-SNAPSHOT is done by following the instructions of SPARK-29245.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis API will provide better usability and performance if we want to get a list of hiveTables with specific type. For example `HiveTableType.VIRTUAL_VIEW` corresponding to `CatalogTableType.VIEW`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo, this is a support function.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd tests in VersionsSuite and manually run JDK11 test with following settings:\r\n\r\n- Hive 2.3.6 Metastore on JDK8\r\n- Hive 2.3.7-SNAPSHOT library build from source of Hive 2.3 branch\r\n- Spark build with Hive 2.3.7-SNAPSHOT on jdk-11.0.6\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-18T17:52:28Z","updated_at":"2020-03-22T00:41:40Z","closed_at":"2020-03-22T00:41:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f12acacf186de99c00850220dfcd0f7d78bf7f47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ff3777faf81079fb7a5f66c84037b3121f8a846a","head":{"label":"Eric5553:GetTableByType","ref":"GetTableByType","sha":"ff3777faf81079fb7a5f66c84037b3121f8a846a","user":{"login":"Eric5553","id":10626956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553","html_url":"https://github.com/Eric5553","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54733158,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDczMzE1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"Eric5553/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Eric5553","id":10626956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI2OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10626956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553","html_url":"https://github.com/Eric5553","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eric5553/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Eric5553/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA few `CREATE TABLE` test cases have some assumption on the default value of `LEGACY_CREATE_HIVE_TABLE_BY_DEFAULT_ENABLED`. This PR (SPARK-31181) makes the test cases more explicit from test-case side.\r\n\r\nThe configuration change was tested via https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27894 during discussing SPARK-31136. This PR has only the test case part from that PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis makes our test case more robust in terms of the default value of `LEGACY_CREATE_HIVE_TABLE_BY_DEFAULT_ENABLED`.
