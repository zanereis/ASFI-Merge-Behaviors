What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nAdd range index support with metadata table\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* This is a WIP PR primarily used for data collection.\r\n* Lot of fundamental metadata table bottlenecks have to be resolved. For example, bootstrapping rangeIndex for 30 partitions of large table (4000 columns) runs into memory issues and driver result too large errors. We also need to implement async metadata table design in V2\r\n* Tried to implement primitive bucketing by column name to improve index locality\r\n* Only implemented commit integration. Clean and other action integration needs to be added.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n* Verified end-to-end by bootstrapping range index on few partitions of large table (4000 columns) \r\n* \r\n* Unit Tests TBD\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nEstimate available memory size for spillable map accurately to avoid OOM. \r\nFor spark engine, there is always more than one task running on the executor and each task maintains a spillable map. The old way doesn't consider this situation and results in OOM. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Modify the way to estimate spillable map available memory in `IOUtils`*\r\n\r\n## Verify this

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFix the bug that MOR supports predicate pushdown when using payload_combine merge type. \r\nWhen reading MOR,  predicate pushdown filters the part data in base file first before combining the log file. The log file record which has the same key with the dropped record in base file can be obtained if it meets the filter conditions. But sometimes record in log is out of date by comparing the precombine column. For example, record has three columns: `key`, `ts`, `col`. `ts` is precombine field. `key` is record key field .\r\nrecord1 in log: [k1, ts0, 0] \r\nrecord2 in base file: [k1, ts1, 1] and ts1 > ts0.\r\nWithout filter condition, we will get the record2. But when the filter condition is `col < 1`,  we will get the record1 and it is wrong.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - set a empty filter when read with payload_combine merge type in MergeOnReadRelation\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Add this case to `testPrunedFiltered` in `TestMORDataSource`\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nA failed deltacommit on the metadata table will be automatically rolled back. Assuming the failed commit was \"t10\", the rollback will happen the next time at \"t11\". Post rollback, when we try to sync the dataset to the metadata table, we should look for all unsynched instants including t11. Current code ignores t11 since the latest commit timestamp on metadata table is t11 (due to rollback).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nUnit test has been

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis CR introduces a new file called```hudi-defaults.conf``` which customers can directly set parameters there. This is not the same as ```hudi.properties```. ```hudi.properties``` is created when customers write a Hudi table and it's a table level configuration.\r\n\r\nHowever, the external configuration file in this PR is not specific to any Hudi table. It's more like a cluster level configuration just like spark-defaults.conf in Spark and flink-conf. yaml in Flink. The benefit of having this external configuration file, is there are some configurations can be shared between different Hudi tables, e.g. Hive JDBC URL, Zookeeper connect URL, HBase URL...\r\n\r\n##

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis pull request let hive can read timestamp type column datas correctly.  \r\nThe problem was initially related to JIRA [HUDI-83](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-83) and related issues on issue https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2544\r\n\r\n- Change `HoodieParquetInputFormat` to use a custom `ParquetInputFormat` named `HudiAvroParquetInputFormat`\r\n- In `HudiAvroParquetInputFormat` we use a custom `RecordReader` named `HudiAvroParquetReader`. In this class we use `AvroReadSupport` so that Hive can get parquet data with an avro GenericRecord.\r\n- Use `org.apache.hudi.hadoop.utils.HoodieRealtimeRecordReaderUtils.avroToArrayWritable` to transform GenericRecord to ArrayWriteable. At the same time, timestamp/date type processing for different situations of hive2 and hive3 is added to this method.\r\n- Set `hoodie.datasource.hive_sync.support_timestamp` default value from false to true\r\n- add a `supportAvroRead` value to be compatible with the adaptation of some old hudi versions for hive3 timestamp/date types\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- hudi-hadoop-mr\r\n- spark\r\n\r\n### Risk level \r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nThe javadoc has been modified and the website document will be on other PR later.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-03T11:15:43Z","updated_at":"2023-06-30T11:29:30Z","closed_at":"2023-06-06T00:07:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1f1a603458d630b6343414d42b3df75b25abbb2","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2284138194,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg0MTM4MTk0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/schema-and-data-types","name":"schema-and-data-types","color":"ceae46","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719802999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAyOTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:major","name":"priority:major","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"degraded

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request let hive can read timestamp type column datas correctly.\r\n\r\nThe problem was initially related to JIRA [HUDI-83](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-83) and related issues on issue https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/2544\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n \r\n-  Change `HoodieParquetInputFormat` to use a custom `ParquetInputFormat` named `HudiAvroParquetInputFormat`\r\n- In `HudiAvroParquetInputFormat` we use a custom `RecordReader` named `HudiAvroParquetReader`. In this class we use `AvroReadSupport` so that Hive can get parquet data with an avro GenericRecord.\r\n- Use `org.apache.hudi.hadoop.utils.HoodieRealtimeRecordReaderUtils.avroToArrayWritable` to transform GenericRecord to ArrayWriteable. At the same time, timestamp processing for different situations of hive2 and hive3 is added to this method.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n`org.apache.hudi.hadoop.TestHoodieParquetInputFormat.testHoodieParquetInputFormatReadTimestamp`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes,
