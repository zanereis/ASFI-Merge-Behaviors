*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently both `HoodieListData` and `HoodieMapPairData` operate eagerly on their payloads meaning that each transformation is immediately applied. \r\n\r\nThis has following performance drawbacks:\r\n\r\n1. It always executes full transformation regardless of whether the whole sequence will be required, potentially wasting quite a bit of compute.\r\n2. It also might be the cause of OOMs if the sequence potentially could be larger than available memory (where caller might be relying on assumption that it would be performing stream processing)\r\n \r\nInstead, in this PR:\r\n\r\n - `HoodieListData` is rebased to hold `Stream`\r\n - New `HoodieListPairData` is replacing `HoodieMapPairData` to provide for lazy stream-processing semantic\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\nThis change added tests and

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen reading the metadata table directly with the metadata table path in Spark, i.e., `spark.read.format(\"hudi\").load(\"<base_path>/.hoodie/metadata/\").show`, it throws NullPointerException from when creating the HFile reader:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n  at org.apache.hudi.org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CacheConfig.<init>(CacheConfig.java:178)\r\n  at

org.apache.hudi.HoodieMergeOnReadRDD.compute(HoodieMergeOnReadRDD.scala:100)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis exception only happens when the metadata table has the HFile base files.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that after `new SerializableConfiguration(hadoopConf)` is broadcasted to the executors, on the executor side, the instance does not have the `configuration` instance enclosed, i.e., `hadoopConfBroadcast.value.get()`, so the configuration is not properly broadcasted.  Then, the HFile CacheConfig cannot use the null hadoop conf for initialization.  Replacing `SerializableConfiguration` with `SerializableWritable` solves the problem.\r\n\r\nNote that this problem can only be reproducible with `yarn` master in Spark.  Using `local` as master, this exception does not happen.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Replace `SerializableConfiguration` with `SerializableWritable` for broadcasting the hadoop conf.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the metadata table with base files in HFile format can be successfully read on EMR using Spark 3.1.3 and 3.2.1, with yarn as

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen reading the metadata table directly with the metadata table path in Spark, i.e., `spark.read.format(\"hudi\").load(\"<base_path>/.hoodie/metadata/\").show`, it throws `NullPointerException` from `getLogRecordScanner`:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n   at org.apache.hudi.metadata.HoodieBackedTableMetadata.getLogRecordScanner(HoodieBackedTableMetadata.java:484)\r\n   at org.apache.hudi.HoodieMergeOnReadRDD$.scanLog(HoodieMergeOnReadRDD.scala:342)\r\n   at org.apache.hudi.HoodieMergeOnReadRDD$LogFileIterator.<init>(HoodieMergeOnReadRDD.scala:173)\r\n   at org.apache.hudi.HoodieMergeOnReadRDD$RecordMergingFileIterator.<init>(HoodieMergeOnReadRDD.scala:252)\r\n   at org.apache.hudi.HoodieMergeOnReadRDD.compute(HoodieMergeOnReadRDD.scala:101)\r\n   at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.computeOrReadCheckpoint(RDD.scala:373)\r\n```\r\nThe root cause is that, in `HoodieMergeOnReadRDD.scanLog`, `tableState.metadataConfig` does not have `hoodie.metadata.enable` set to `true` by default.  Thus, `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` instantiated based on the config does not properly initialize the `metadataMetaClient`, causing NPE.\r\n\r\nIn this use case, given that user explicitly specifies metadata table path for reading, the `hoodie.metadata.enable` should be overwritten to `true` for proper read behavior.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - In `HoodieMergeOnReadRDD.scanLog`, rebuild the `HoodieMetadataConfig` with `hoodie.metadata.enable` set to `true`\r\n  - Fix `TestMetadataTableWithSparkDataSource` to follow the common pattern for reading metadata table, i.e., `spark.read.format(\"hudi\").load(\"<base_path>/.hoodie/metadata/\")`, without setting any options\r\n \r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `TestMetadataTableWithSparkDataSource` fails with `spark.read.format(\"hudi\").load(\"<base_path>/.hoodie/metadata/\")`.  After this PR, the test class passes.  The spark read of metadata table is also verified with Spark 2.4.4, 3.1.3, and 3.2.1 locally and on S3.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on top of #5350 \r\n\r\n- So far, archival will stop at the first savepoint commit and will not proceed further. For users who may not be interested in incremental queries, but just \"as of instant\", we can let them proceed further by skipping just the savepoint commit. This opens up new opportunities for Hudi users. For eg, one can retain commits for years, by adding one savepoint per day for older commits (say > 30 days old).  And they can query hudi using \"as of instant\" for very old data. If not, one has to retain every commit and let archival stop at the first commit which may not be a good experience for users. \r\n- Had to fix one the core methods in HoodieTimeline with this change boolean `isBeforeTimelineStarts(String instant)`. Please do check the changes here. Prior to this patch, we don't allow any holes in the timeline. An instant is considered committed if it's part of the active timeline or if it's < first entry in the active timeline. But since we are letting archival go beyond savepoints, there could be holes in the active timeline. \r\nFor eg; C1, C2, C3, Savepoint_C3, C4, C5, Savepoint_C5, C6, C7, C8, C9. \r\nLet's say, C1, C2, C4, and C6 are archived (with the fix in this patch, otherwise, archival will not proceed after C2). \r\n\r\nSo, the active timeline is C3, savepoint_C3, C5, Savepoint_C5, C7, C8, C9. \r\nIf a filegroup committed with C4 is checked for `isBeforeTimelineStarts(String instant)`, we might return false. So, the fix is to find the first non-savepoint commit in the active timeline and treat that as the first entry in the active timeline. Any instant < this first non-savepoint commit will be considered a valid instant time.\r\nSo, in the above case, it's C7, `isBeforeTimelineStarts(C4)` will return true.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a new config named `hoodie.archive.beyond.savepoint` which will guard this behaviour. Have set the default value to false to retain the old behaviour. \r\n- Changes in `HoodieTimelineArchiver` to honour the config. \r\n- Fixed implementation of `isBeforeTimelineStarts(String instant)` to cater to holes in the active timeline to deduce valid completed commits.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n-

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently, HoodieHFileReader checks the writer and reader schema strictly, if the default value of an added field in the reader Schema is missing，the reader will throw an exception, even if the field type is [\"someType\", \"null\"].\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to solve the problem:\r\n1. add default values to added field in the reader schema, and fix some asserts in the UT\r\n2. get the raw data and then construct the record with the new schema\r\n\r\nTo be consistent with ORC reader, I picked the 2nd.\r\n\r\n## Brief change

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Looks like getAllPartitionPaths have regressed in perf from 0.9.0 to 0.11.0. I could able to triage it to newly written code where in \"isExists()\" is called to determine Hoodie partition metadata. So, reverting the change to how it was before. \r\n\r\nOffending commit is https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4643\r\n\r\nI tried listing a table with 10k partitions. 0.9.0 is taking 85 to 90 secs, while 0.11.0 took ~800 secs. \r\nHoodiePartitionMetadata.hasPartitionMetadata is taking roughly 50 to 60% when profiled. With the fix in this patch, listing took ~90 secs. \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-10 at 12 35 28

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn our production environment, since many table's id is auto-increment， if using Hbase index, will cause a data skew issue in HBase regions. it is better to find a way to add random prefixes and also keep ordering in hudi itself.\r\n\r\nwe may have a small modification to the HBase index. add the prefix on the aspect of query and update HBase. In\r\nthis way, the pk in HBase will be different from the one in hudi but such\r\nlogic will be transparent to business logic. I have adopted this method in\r\nprod environment. Using withIndexClass config in IndexConfig could specify\r\nthe custom index \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother work, driven by uber engineers https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3508 could\r\ntechnically solve the issue by directly reading HFiles, but still in progress, this approach should resolve this issue immediately\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any

follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ]

read hoodie table.\r\n\r\n## *Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n automatically enable schema evolution when read hoodie table.\r\n1) When schema evolution happen, we cannot just rely on the configuration item to check whether schema evolution is enabled. If the user forgets to set that config， reading hoodie table will fail. \r\n2) we detect whether an available historySchema exist in schema folder or not,  which is less expensive than parsing internalschema directly\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFix flakey test testReaderFilterRowKeys in TestHoodieOrcReaderWriter\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nTestReaderFilterRowKeys needs to get the key from RECORD_KEY_METADATA_FIELD, but the writer in current UT does not populate the meta field and the schema does not contains meta fields. \r\n\r\nThis fix writes data with schema which contains meta fields and calls writeAvroWithMetadata for writing.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, TestHoodieOrcReaderWriter\r\n\r\n## Committer

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n* Upgrade Hadoop to `3.1.0` Original hadoop 3.x [JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2955?filter=-1 \r\n](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-2955) \r\n* Upgrade Hive to `3.1.2`\r\n* Make Spark `3.2` the default profile by porting the changes of this closed PR  Original spark 3 profile default JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3088  https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4752 \r\n\r\n* Have Azure CI run against these upgraded versions (Passing)\r\n* Have Onehouse CI run against spark3 scala 2.12 (Passing)\r\n* Have Onehouse CI run against spark2 scala 2.11 (Passing)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main Changes \r\n* Change Hudi Docker Setup to support these upgraded versions( renamed several files, added necessary dependencies and configurations for Hadoop Hive etc.) \r\n* Upgrade jetty.version to `9.4.43.v20210629` and javalin version to `3.13.12` ( since these are couple together) to stay in line with EMR versions of these deps, as well as minor api fixes to `RequestHandler` and `TimelineServer`\r\n* Resolve Jetty dep conflict by doing many exclusions of jetty dependency throughout the package since Hadoop and Hive bring in jetty `9.3.x` which causes conflicts with the above jetty version. \r\n* Added `jetty` dependencies in timeline-service pom in order to avoid dependency conflicts (without this many tests fail) \r\n* Minor Api changes made in `HoodieRealtimeRecordReaderUtils` in order for both avro `1.8.2` and avro `1.10.2` versions to be used. \r\n* Define explicit parquet version in Hudi hadoop mr ( the reason for this is that hive `3.1.2` expects parquet `1.10.2`, otherwise we get into a dep conflict since the parquet version defined in root pom is `1.12` which is what spark `3.2.1` uses.) \r\n* Make changes in `azure-pipelines.yaml` for spark 3.2.1\r\n* Fix tests to be compatible with spark 3.2.1\r\n* Resolve `log4j` dependency conflict (several exclusions done) \r\n* Resolve `netty` dependency conflict (several exclusions done) \r\n* Fix test failures reported since we have not been running azure ci with spark3 before this pr\r\n* Disabled tests which were flaky or have an issue (documented below)\r\n\r\n\r\n## List of tests disabled in order to have the azure ci green (reasons documented in each

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Key fetched from metadata table especially from base file reader is not sorted. and hence may result in throwing NPE (key prefix search) or unnecessary seeks to starting of Hfile (full key look ups). Fixing the same in this patch. This is not an issue with log blocks, since sorting is taking care within [HoodieHfileDataBlock](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/7da97c8096ad4eabb49b42c86013679ed5009451/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/common/table/log/block/HoodieHFileDataBlock.java#L211). \r\n- Commit where the sorting was mistakenly reverted https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5208/\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Sorting list of keys and key prefixes to be looked up with base file reader in metadata table.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Fixed one of the test in TestColStatsIndex. \r\n- Verifying the sort fix is going to be hard as it has to be a perf validation. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- When async indexer is invoked only with \"FILES\" partition, it fails. Fixing the same in this patch. Also, if metadata table itself is not initialized, and if someone is looking to build indexes via AsyncIndexer, first they are expected to index \"FILES\" partition followed by other partitions. In general, we have a limitation of building only one index at a time w/ AsyncIndexer and hence. Have added guards to ensure these conditions are met. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed Async Indexer to support building \"FILES\" partition. Previously there were some exceptions thrown as linked in the jira. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Added tests to TestHoodieIndexer. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nBucketIndexPartitioner take partition path for dispersion may cause the fileID of the task to not be loaded correctly.\r\nIn the old version, `getbuckettoload()` was used to initialize the bucketnum that the current task needs to load. However, after a joined the partition path, a task may receive the same bucket num, which makes some tasks unable to correctly load their own bucktnum and partition.Eventually, new files will always be generated under some data partitions.\r\n*(For example: This pull request adds quick-start document.)*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nDue to the incorrect class being compared, bulk insert would still register UDFs for a non-partitioned table.

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nExecuting on Spark has non-trivial amount of overhead, and therefore has to have a potential of considerable speed-up due to parallelization of the execution. In case of Data Skipping seq fetching Column Stats Index, it only could be justified for **very large** tables (100s of 1000s of files, 100s of columns). \r\n\r\nAs such, we have to provide an alternative way of fetching Column Stats Index w/in the reading process to avoid the penalty of a more heavy-weight execution scheduled t/h a Spark engine.\r\n\r\nThis allows to considerably speed up Data Skipping Currently having overhead of at least 1-2s even for tables with a handful of files.\r\n\r\nCore of the changes in this PR:\r\n\r\n - Interacting w/ CSI is encapsulated w/in `ColumnStatsIndexSupport`\r\n - Fetching CSI is now available in 2 modes: \"in-process\" and via \"spark\" (where the one applied is determined by either a simple heuristic estimating the target size of the projected index or a config override)\r\n - CSI projections are cached w/in `ColumnStatsIndexSupport` (and are refreshed in-sync w/ `HoodieFileIndex`)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - TBD\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThere are multiple issues with our current DataSource V2 integrations: b/c we advertise Hudi tables as V2, Spark expects it to implement certain APIs which are not implemented at the moment, instead we're using custom Resolution rule (in HoodieSpark3Analysis) to instead manually fallback to V1 APIs. This poses following problems:\r\n\r\n1. It doesn't fully implement Spark's protocol: for ex, this rule doesn't cache produced `LogicalPlan` making Spark re-create Hudi relations from scratch (including doing full table's file-listing) for every query reading this table. However, adding the caching in that sequence is not an option, since V2 APIs manage cache differently and therefore for us to be able to leverage that cache we will have to manage all of its lifecycle (adding, flushing)\r\n\r\n2. Additionally, HoodieSpark3Analysis rule does not pass table's schema from the Spark Catalog to Hudi's relations making them fetch the schema from storage (either from commit's metadata or data file) every time\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Make sure HoodieBaseRelation always prefers schemaSpec over fetching schema from the storage;\r\n - Make HoodieCatalog and Spark3DefaultSource return V1Table instead of `HoodieInternalV2Table` to make sure Spark treats Hudi tables as V1 and not V2\r\n - Added `HoodieV1Table` extractor to match Hudi tables;\r\n - Reverting DSv2 APIs (to make Spark use V1)\r\n - Fix missing fixture of the `DateTimeZone.default`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ]

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAs has been outlined in HUDI-4176, we've hit a roadblock while testing Hudi on a large dataset (~1Tb) having pretty fat commits where Hudi's commit metadata could reach into 100s of Mbs.\r\n\r\nAs could be seen from the screenshot in such cases current implementation of `TableSchemaResolver` is doing a lot of repeated throw-away computations reading `HoodieCommitMetadata` (during init, fetching table's schema, fetching table's internal schema, etc).\r\n\r\nGiven the size some of ours commit metadata instances Spark's parsing and resolving phase (when `spark.sql(...)` is involved, but before returned `Dataset` is dereferenced) starts to dominate some of our queries' execution time.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/428277/171506079-6bdf6501-5ed1-49ad-b0b1-48d871b28863.png)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Rebased onto new APIs to avoid excessive Hadoop's Path allocations\r\n - Eliminated `hasOperationField` completely to avoid repeatitive computations\r\n - Cleaning up duplication in `HoodieActiveTimeline`\r\n - Added caching for common instances of `HoodieCommitMetadata`\r\n - Made `tableStructSchema` lazy;\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella
