This has been quite an odyssey to fix and we needed to roll back the change the last time. Please consider trying the changes out in an environment where you can assert latency and stability for different runtimes etc.\r\n\r\nI myself have run:\r\n- 3x Latency simulation (important, caught a regression last time) => **no regression**\r\n- 3x Warm action simulation => **no regression**\r\n- 1x Cold action simulation => **no regression**\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n- Explicitly consume and close the response's entity in any case (even if ignored) to make sure the connections get released properly and are not leaked.\r\n- Use optimized path for consuming the entire entity into a string if its length is within bounds.\r\n- Don't reuse connections.\r\n\r\nTo the last point: Reusing connections when a runtime doesn't support it adds a significant latency overhead when closing the response's entity. That's likely due to some sort of mismatched behavior (client wants to keep the connection open, the server doesn't even know the concept). The latency overhead in those cases (10-20ms of latency added in latency tests) seem far higher than the latency overhead of establishing a new connection (not measurable in latency tests).\r\nDropping connection reuse also solves any issues that might be encountered due to the pause/resume cycles of the container, in which sockets don't react to any event at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [X] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

creating an action, the code is sent to the controller. Afterwards the controller checks, that the code is not too big. If the code itself is sent directly (e.g. uploading a single `.js` file), the limit is 48MB (today).\r\nIf an archive is uploaded, it will be encoded with base64. The problem here is, that base64 has an overhead of 1/3. This means, if you have an archive, that has a size of e.g. 45MB, 60MB will be sent to the controller. So the request will be rejected. This is not expected for the user, as a limit of 48MB was proposed to him.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that bug.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (apache-mailing-list)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR introduces a SPI to configure a different authentication directive used in the REST API\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis PR introduces a SPI to swap/exchange authentication directives in the REST API. \r\nThe existing SPI does basic authentication only. With this PR alternative authentication methods \r\nlike bearer token can be enabled. This capability is for example needed to support \r\nexternal IAM systems.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it packages the existing functionality to verify the basic authentication header to be consumed in the SPI without functional changes.\r\n\r\n[PG 1:3115 passed]\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\nI explained the background of these changes on the mailing list\r\n[Extending Authentication and Entitlement - Heads up](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/891855d699710ba53e89a12c817c6e7d2560023c588f6f5a3bd74ca6@%3Cdev.openwhisk.apache.org%3E)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [x] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

`db` command support to export and import the db contents to scala based wskadmin impl (#3722)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCurrent `wskadmin` support dumping the db content for various collections, views etc to file via `db` command\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ wskadmin db get -h\r\nusage: wskadmin db get [-h] [-v VIEW] [--docs] database\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  database              the database name\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  -v VIEW, --view VIEW  the view in the database to get\r\n  --docs                include document contents\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR will support both `get` (export) and `put` (import) commands to admin tooling. \r\n\r\n### Streaming IO\r\n\r\nThe export and import support would make use of Akka Streams. \r\n\r\nFor e.g. for exporting the json from CouchDB it would make use of [\\_all_docs][1] endpoint which uses chunked transfer encoding. This logic is implemented in `CouchDBStreamingStore` which makes use of [Alpakka JSON Streaming][2] support to dump each json document as a single line\r\n\r\nThe JSON dump file created via `get` would have a one json record per line and thus can again be consumed in a streaming way\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Export - Filter by view\r\n- [ ] Export - Attachments\r\n- [ ] Import \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

`docker pull` can fail due to various reasons. One of them is network throttling by the image registry. Since we try to pull on each blackbox invocation, high volume load can cause lots of errors due to failing pulls unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nInstead, we try to run the container even if the pull failed in the first place. If the image is available locally, the container will start just fine and recover the error gracefully. If the image is not available locally, the run will fail as well and return the same error as the docker pull would've returned.\r\n\r\nThis behavior will only be enabled for blackbox actions that specify a tag. Blackbox actions not using a tag *or* using \"latest\" as a tag will exhibit the very same behavior as today. That is: There will always be a pull before each container start and a failing pull will result in an error reported to the user. This is to enable rapid prototyping on images and enable determinism in the workflow. Updating the action will then force a pull and will fail early if that pull fails. With the new behavior, the developer might be surprised by the image not being updated because the pull is swallowed.\r\n\r\nFor production workload it is considered best-practice to version images through labels, thus we can \"safely\" assume that we can fall back to a local image in case the pull fails.\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [X] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

and how your changes are tested. -->\r\nHttpUtils (http client for invoker -> action container) uses org.apache.http client that is synchronous and poor performing for concurrent requests. I ran into problems using it with concurrent activation support. Instead of trying to force that client to work, this PR is to work towards replacing it (or re-replacing it) with akka http based client.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides:\r\n* add a ContainerClient trait to define the http client interface \r\n* refactoring of HttpUtils to implement this trait (HttpUtils remains default for now)\r\n* add a PoolingContainerClient to provide a akka http based impl (based on PoolingRestClient)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

concurrency support in nodejs container) https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/pull/41 were good, where tests requiring coordinated completion of 128 concurrent requests

PR allows to store variant data in the Authkey that is part of the use identity and pass this data \r\nto the user container via environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis PR is preparing the introduction of a authentication SPI. One prerequisite for supporting different authorization mechanisms is the ability to pass the information contained in this authorization artifacts down to the user containers (e.g. to call out to other services using \r\nthese artifacts). This ability is implemented by serializing the information into a JSON structure\r\nthat is mixed in into environment available to the runtimes.\r\n\r\n[PG3:2472 passed]\r\n\r\n## Related issue and

PR introduces a `S3AttachmentStore` which is an `AttachmentStore` implementation for storing attachments in [S3][3] API compatible object storages\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to use this with [IBM Cloud Object Storage][5] as it supports S3 API. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n`S3AttachmentStore` uses [Alpakka S3 Connector][1] for making calls to S3. The object key is constructed in following form\r\n\r\n    <namespace>/<docId>/<name>\r\n\r\nWhere \r\n\r\n* `namespace` - Entity type in lowercase. For now only `whiskentity` is used with attachments\r\n    - whiskentity\r\n    - whiskauth\r\n    - whiskactivation \r\n* docId - Document entity path\r\n* name - attachment name. It would be uuid \r\n\r\nIt supports following operations\r\n\r\n1. `readAttachment` - Read is done in a streaming way using [GET Object][6]\r\n2. `attach` - Stream is uploaded via [multipart upload][7] API where upload is done in chunks of 5 MB and then finally stitched together. This avoids buffering the whole stream on disk. So any upload would invoke 2+ remote calls to complete upload\r\n3. `deleteAttachments` - This is done via [List Objects v2][8] API to list object under prefix `<namespace>/<docId>` and then remove them via [delete object][9] api\r\n4. `deleteAttachment` - This is done via single [delete object][9] api\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nTo enable use of `S3AttachmentStore` following env variables need to be set\r\n\r\n1. `CONFIG_whisk_spi_AttachmentStoreProvider` = `whisk.core.database.s3.S3AttachmentStoreProvider`\r\n2. `CONFIG_whisk_s3_bucket` - Bucket name\r\n3. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS Access Key ID. See [Access Keys][10] for details on key id and access key. Also see [AWS Java SDK][11] for details on how access keys are looked up \r\n4. `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`\r\n5. `AWS_REGION` - . AWS Region name. See [AWS Region Selection][12] for details\r\n\r\nSee [Alpakka S3][1] for more configuration details. In OpenWhisk setup the config are under `whisk.s3.alpakka` namespace (see s3-reference.conf for details)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAll attachment related test  are consolidated in `S3AttachmentStoreBehaviorBase` and then there are suites to run it against various options\r\n\r\n1.  `S3AttachmentStoreMinioTests` - Performs testing against a [Minio S3 Proxy][2]. These test only need docker to be present. \r\n2. `S3AttachmentStoreAwsTests` - Performs testing against S3. It requires following env variables to be configured. These are configured in travis settingsnfor master repo and in my fork. So are executed there.\r\n    a. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`\r\n    b. `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`\r\n    c. `AWS_REGION` \r\n\r\nWe can also use [S3Mock][4] which is built on top of akka stack but then it may later pose problem if our dependency version diverge. So using Minio for now\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nS3 support pulls in following dependencies\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./gradlew :core:controller:dependencies \r\n     \\--- com.lightbend.akka:akka-stream-alpakka-s3_2.11:0.19\r\n          +--- org.scala-lang:scala-library:2.11.12\r\n          +--- com.typesafe.akka:akka-stream_2.11:2.5.12 (*)\r\n          +--- com.typesafe.akka:akka-http_2.11:10.0.13 -> 10.1.1 (*)\r\n          +--- com.typesafe.akka:akka-http-xml_2.11:10.0.13\r\n          |    +--- org.scala-lang:scala-library:2.11.11 -> 2.11.12\r\n          |    +--- com.typesafe.akka:akka-http_2.11:10.0.13 -> 10.1.1 (*)\r\n          |    +--- com.typesafe.akka:akka-stream_2.11:2.4.20 -> 2.5.12 (*)\r\n          |    \\--- org.scala-lang.modules:scala-xml_2.11:1.0.6 (*)\r\n          \\--- com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-core:1.11.295\r\n               +--- software.amazon.ion:ion-java:1.0.2\r\n               \\--- joda-time:joda-time:2.8.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd s3 support increases the size of controller.tar from 88 MB (92 jars) to 91 MB (97 jars).

PR modifies the current attachment inlining logic to work at `ByteString` level and avoid converting ByteString to bytes and back. This fixes #3770\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nSo far the inlining logic was converting a stream of `ByteString` to byte array and then working at byte level. This was causing the upload to slow down and also reverse conversion of stream of bytes to `ByteString` was not working as expected.\r\n\r\nInstead of doing that it now uses approach mentioned [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/akka-user/FdQAAzcwrqM) and works at `ByteString` level. \r\n\r\nSee [this commit](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/3777/commits/a36bfb14a47bf3773b5dce13790c57f159874467) for this specific change\r\n\r\n1. Do a `prefixAndTail` of 1 element\r\n2. If extracted byteString prefix \r\n    1. is empty then stream is considered inline\r\n    2. else merge the byteString prefix with `previousPrefix` and see if the size is still less than maxInlineSize or not\r\n        1. If yes then recursively call `inlineAndTail` with new source and bytestring accumulated so far\r\n        2. otherwise stream cannot be inlined and return a combined source of prefix extracted so far with tail\r\n\r\n```scala \r\n  protected[database] def inlineAndTail(docStream: Source[ByteString, _],\r\n                                        previousPrefix: ByteString = ByteString.empty)(\r\n    implicit ec: ExecutionContext): Future[Either[ByteString, Source[ByteString, _]]] = {\r\n    docStream.prefixAndTail(1).runWith(Sink.head).flatMap {\r\n      case (prefix, tail) =>\r\n        prefix.headOption.fold {\r\n          Future.successful[Either[ByteString, Source[ByteString, _]]](Left(previousPrefix))\r\n        } { prefix =>\r\n          val completePrefix = previousPrefix ++ prefix\r\n          if (completePrefix.size < maxInlineSize.toBytes) {\r\n            inlineAndTail(tail, completePrefix)\r\n          } else {\r\n            Future.successful(Right(tail.prepend(Source.single(completePrefix))))\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith new impl the time taken to attach is similar to setup where inlining is disabled. \r\n\r\nSome other aspects\r\n\r\n1. Re-enables the attachment inlining by setting `max-inline-size` to 16 kb (same as one before #3769)\r\n2. Removed the `chunk-size` config as its not needed\r\n3. Refactors the logic related to uploading attachment to an `AttachmentStore` to `AttachmentSupport` trait as that remains same irrespective of `ArtifactStore`\r\n4. Also includes a test which uploads 5MB attachment so as to check working with mid size attachments\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#3770)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR addresses a small bug introduced in https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/3694 which prevents a test from dictating that it does not care about the exit code.

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\nThis PR introduces a configurable multiplicator to influence the forced active ack timeout period.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn rare condition one can see that the load balancer put activations into queues of invokers falsely \r\nidentified to have free capacity because forced active acks  are send out for activation that are waiting in the queue to be executed. With increasing  the timeout the loadbalancer can be influenced to distribute the load wider in this cases. \r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [x] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

think this pr still needs some improvements, but I need some feedback on current implementation.\r\n\r\nThis pr makes the action blob size configurable with some docs for deployment and system tuning.\r\n\r\nI’ve tested for 200MB zip file for execution,\r\n\r\nRequired changes contain two kind of limitations:\r\n1. Size limit.\r\n2. Timeout limit.\r\n\r\nSize limit:\r\n\r\n1. Nginx: `http.client_max_body_size`\r\n2. Akka: `http.[client/server].parsing.max-content-length`\r\n3. Internal size limitation passed by pure config. (remove hardcoded limit)\r\n4. Database: only support on couchdb currently, -> `httpd.max_http_request_size`\r\n\r\nAll these can be done with same config —> `limit_action_blob_size`\r\n\r\nTimeout:\r\n1. Akka: http.[client/server].[request-timeout/idle-timeout]\r\n2. Couchdb: query_server_config.os_process_limit (in sec)\r\n3. Action invocation timeout.\r\n\r\n### Discussion:\r\n\r\n1. To make the size limit configurable, requires some changes in runtimes. [sample-change-in-node](https://github.com/tz70s/incubator-openwhisk-runtime-nodejs/commit/4f1f562c5de9827fd296521972928a228a5d436d). Invoker will pass the size limit as environment variables to it, same as `__OW_API_HOST`. Is this appropriate?\r\n\r\n2. I didn't add any timeout related variables passed from ansible. There might be still some efforts for user to configure correctly. But the behavior of timeout depends on system resources, to avoid potential risk, using ad-hoc configuration currently.\r\n\r\n3. Due to same config passed into `akka.http.[client/server].xxx`, I think that would be nice to raise them to upper level -> i.e. `akka.http.parsing.max-content-length`. User can override it on either server or client config, but I'm not sure whether there's any risk or not?\r\n\r\n4. See the system tuning section: to test with large action blob size, needs lots of changes for system tuning in current travis build. Therefore, no additional tests are provided now.\r\n\r\n5. After testing, I think the large action size is still not a recommended way, seems current implementation of OpenWhisk requires lots of optimization to support it. Therefore, I've mentioned this into doc.\r\n\r\n6. There's another way to config database's `request-size-limit` via controller side by using remote (http) APIs, might be better by using same abstraction for all artifact store.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Tzu-Chiao Yeh <su3g4284zo6y7@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [x] Opened issue to propose and discuss this change (#3712)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [x] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [x] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [x] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

PR makes the uuid an explicit part of a namespace  object containing name and uuid of a namespace.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nIn many places the uuid stored in the authkey is now used as the unique way to identify\r\na namespace. This behavior entangles the authorization mechanisms\r\nwith other unrelated parts of the code, making changes and extensions of the authentication mechanism unnecessarily hard.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the uuid a member of a new namespace object containing the name and the\r\nuuid of the namespace. All references to the uuid that are not used on the context of authorization are using the new namespace object as source.\r\n\r\n[PG3:2375 succceded]\r\n\r\n## Related issue and

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR extends #3680 and removes the gradle tasks which build of the action runtimes. The images are expected to be build by their respective repositories and published to a common registry. It is still possible to develop a runtime locally and test without publishing the image by the image pulls.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# skip image pulls\r\n    ansible-playbook -i environments/local invoker.yml -e 'skip_pull_runtimes=true'\r\n\r\n# similarly using redo aka wskdev\r\n    redo invoker -e\"skip_pull_runtimes=true\" \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `redo` utility was update to build generic runtimes by specifying their name to a `runtime:<name>` task where name is matches a wide regex. The repository is expected to follow the standard gradle build process.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   redo --dir /path/to/runtime/repo runtime:nodejs6action\r\n```\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [x] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [x] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

is a pass to clean up some of the type hierarchies that resulted from splitting of the tests between CLI and REST. \r\n\r\nThis is not meant to be the end of the cleanup but a meaningful incremental checkpoint. \r\nIn this PR:\r\n- [x] removed redundancies between the rest and cli type hierarchies\r\n- [x] removed unnecessary mixins\r\n- [x] removed buried actor system in rest variant which results in 6 actor systems per instance\r\n- [x] renamed the types to be clearer (imo)\r\n- [x] removed obsolete tests\r\n- [x] removed `return` uses\r\n- [x] removed some uses of `var` that i came across\r\n- [x] other scala-isms such as use of map.empty,  s/loop/map\r\n\r\nLabeling as breaking out of caution since there was a lot of refactoring - I kept the top level `Wsk` type to minimize

`default.replication.factor` and `offsets.topic.replication.factor`\r\nalso uses `kafka.replicationFactor`, it is better to adjust `offsets.topic.\r\nreplication.factor` to `the number of kafka nodes`.\r\n\r\nWhy need to change `offsets.topic.replication.factor` to `the number of kafka nodes`?\r\nthe reason as below, for example:\r\nExist 5 kafka nodes:[0,1,2,3,4]\r\n`health` topic's partition0's replicas: `[0,1,3]`,\r\nbut `__consumer_offsets` for this topic is `[1,2,4]`\r\nif `[1,2,4]` are also stoped, the consumer can't get message from health topic, will report `offset commit failed` error.\r\nSo has need to change the  `offsets.topic.replication.factor` value to `number of kafka nodes`\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\n##

PR adds a new ruby:2.5 kind to allow Ruby methods like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef main(param)\r\n  { :result => param.upcase }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis PR is quite similar to #2415, but this time I did it in Ruby. I do believe there are certain number of developers who'd love to pick Ruby as a primary language (see #2046 for an instance).\r\n\r\nCurrently Ruby runtime is tentatively hosted at [remore/openwhisk-runtime-ruby](https://github.com/remore/openwhisk-runtime-ruby), but needless to say I'd love to move/transfer this to anywhere The Apache Software Foundation manage.\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n#2046 is most likely related\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [ ] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [x] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (generally a non-breaking change which closes an issue).\r\n- [x] Enhancement or new feature (adds new functionality).\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (a bug fix or enhancement which changes existing behavior).\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I signed an [Apache CLA](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n- [x] I reviewed the [style guides](https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/wiki/Contributing:-Git-guidelines#code-readiness) and followed the recommendations (Travis CI will check :).\r\n- [x] I added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [x] My changes require further changes to the documentation.\r\n- [x] I updated the documentation where necessary.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-06T04:25:42Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T10:23:18Z","closed_at":"2018-07-30T19:26:47Z","merged_at":"2018-07-30T19:26:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"35cf728ca125ea8c6183de43e3ee078b157ea2a5","assignee":{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rabbah","id":4959922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTk5MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4959922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah","html_url":"https://github.com/rabbah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rabbah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":366639312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNjY2MzkzMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/labels/runtime","name":"runtime","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":401833916,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDE4MzM5MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/openwhisk/labels/review","name":"review","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"Review

Provide a concise summary of your changes in the Title -->\r\n\r\nIncreases the `max-open-requests` akka-http configuration value so that triggers invocations will not be as  likely to encounter a `akka.stream.BufferOverflowException`. This is a temporary patch until a proper fix is implemented. \r\n\r\nError example:\r\n```\r\n[TriggersApi] trigger-fired action 'someTrigger' failed to invoke with akka.stream.BufferOverflowException: Exceeded configured max-open-requests value of [512]. This means that the request queue of this pool (HostConnectionPoolSetup(localhost,8080,ConnectionPoolSetup(ConnectionPoolSettings(128,0,5,512,1,30 seconds,ClientConnectionSettings(Some(User-Agent: akka-http/10.1.1),10 seconds,1 minute,512,None,WebSocketSettings(<function0>,ping,Duration.Inf,<function0>),List(),ParserSettings(2048,16,64,64,8192,64,8388608,256,52428800,Strict,RFC6265,false,Full,Error,Map(If-Range -> 0, If-Modified-Since -> 0, If-Unmodified-Since -> 0, default -> 12, Content-MD5 -> 0, Date -> 0, If-Match -> 0, If-None-Match -> 0, User-Agent -> 32),false,true,<function1>,<function1>,<function2>),None,TCPTransport),New,1 second),akka.http.scaladsl.HttpsConnectionContext@79ff7c6b,akka.event.MarkerLoggingAdapter@6e8fc09c))) has completely filled up because the pool currently does not process requests fast enough to handle the incoming request load. Please retry the request later. See http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/client-side/pool-overflow.html for more information.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of what problem you are solving and how your changes are tested. -->\r\n\r\n## Related issue and scope\r\n<!--- Please include a link to a related issue if there is one. -->\r\n- [ ] I opened an issue to propose and discuss this change (#????)\r\n\r\n## My changes affect the following components\r\n<!--- Select below all system components are affected by your change. -->\r\n<!--- Enter an `x` in all applicable boxes. -->\r\n- [ ] API\r\n- [x] Controller\r\n- [ ] Message Bus (e.g., Kafka)\r\n- [ ] Loadbalancer\r\n- [ ] Invoker\r\n- [ ] Intrinsic actions (e.g., sequences, conductors)\r\n- [ ] Data stores (e.g., CouchDB)\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Deployment\r\n- [ ] CLI\r\n- [ ] General tooling\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
