2.34.0</h2>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Passing the javac flag <code>--should-stop=ifError=FLOW</code> is now required when running Error Prone (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4595\">#4595</a>)</li>\n<li>The <code>MemberName</code> check was renamed to <a href=\"https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/IdentifierName\"><code>IdentifierName</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>New checks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/FutureTransformAsync\"><code>FutureTransformAsync</code></a>: The usage of transformAsync is not necessary when all the return values of the transformation function are immediate futures.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MisformattedTestData\"><code>MisformattedTestData</code></a>: Reformats Java source code inside Error Prone test cases.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MisleadingEscapedSpace\"><code>MisleadingEscapedSpace</code></a>: Using <code>\\s</code> anywhere except at the end of a line in a text block is potentially misleading.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ThrowIfUncheckedKnownUnchecked\"><code>ThrowIfUncheckedKnownUnchecked</code></a>: <code>throwIfUnchecked(knownUnchecked)</code> is equivalent to <code>throw knownUnchecked</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Closed issues: <a

2.34.0</h2>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Passing the javac flag <code>--should-stop=ifError=FLOW</code> is now required when running Error Prone (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4595\">#4595</a>)</li>\n<li>The <code>MemberName</code> check was renamed to <a href=\"https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/IdentifierName\"><code>IdentifierName</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>New checks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/FutureTransformAsync\"><code>FutureTransformAsync</code></a>: The usage of transformAsync is not necessary when all the return values of the transformation function are immediate futures.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MisformattedTestData\"><code>MisformattedTestData</code></a>: Reformats Java source code inside Error Prone test cases.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MisleadingEscapedSpace\"><code>MisleadingEscapedSpace</code></a>: Using <code>\\s</code> anywhere except at the end of a line in a text

profiling instead of instrumentation. This extension enhances traces by running <a href=\"https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler\">async-profiler</a> in wall-clock profiling mode whenever there is an active sampled OpenTelemetry span.</p>\n<p>The resulting profiling data is analyzed afterward and spans are &quot;inferred&quot;. This means there is a delay between the regular and the inferred spans being visible in your OpenTelemetry backend/UI.</p>\n<h3>JFR connection</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for using diagnostic command to start a recording (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/pull/1352\">#1352</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JMX metrics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Support both a script and target systems (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/pull/1339\">#1339</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🙇 Thank you</h3>\n<p>This release was possible thanks to the following contributors who shared their brilliant ideas and awesome pull requests:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bjrara\"><code>@​bjrara</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/breedx-splk\"><code>@​breedx-splk</code></a></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/pull/1330\">#1330</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Inferred spans - New 🌟</h3>\n<p>An OpenTelemetry extension for generating spans via profiling instead of instrumentation. This extension enhances traces by running <a href=\"https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler\">async-profiler</a> in wall-clock profiling mode whenever there is an active sampled OpenTelemetry span.</p>\n<p>The resulting profiling data is analyzed afterward and spans are &quot;inferred&quot;. This means there is a delay between the regular and the inferred spans being visible in your OpenTelemetry backend/UI.</p>\n<h3>JFR connection</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix for using diagnostic command to start a recording (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/pull/1352\">#1352</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JMX metrics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Support both a script and target systems (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/pull/1339\">#1339</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>🙇 Thank you</h3>\n<p>This release was possible thanks to the following contributors who shared their brilliant ideas and awesome pull requests:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bjrara\"><code>@​bjrara</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/breedx-splk\"><code>@​breedx-splk</code></a></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
