pull request\r\n\r\nFix the bug introduced by HUDI-892 HUDI-892 introduce this problem。\r\nthis pr skip adding projection columns if there are no log files in the hoodieRealtimeSplit。 but this pr donnot consider that multiple getRecordReaders share same jobConf。\r\nConsider the following questions：\r\nwe have four getRecordReaders:\r\n```\r\nreader1(its hoodieRealtimeSplit contains no log files)\r\nreader2 (its hoodieRealtimeSplit contains log files)\r\nreader3(its hoodieRealtimeSplit contains log files)\r\nreader4(its hoodieRealtimeSplit contains no log files)\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow reader1 run first, HoodieInputFormatUtils.HOODIE_READ_COLUMNS_PROP in jobConf will be set to be true, and no hoodie additional projection columns will be added to jobConf （see HoodieParquetRealtimeInputFormat.addProjectionToJobConf）\r\n\r\nreader2 run later, since HoodieInputFormatUtils.HOODIE_READ_COLUMNS_PROP in jobConf is set to be true, no hoodie additional projection columns will be added to jobConf. （see HoodieParquetRealtimeInputFormat.addProjectionToJobConf）\r\nwhich lead to the result that _hoodie_record_key would be missing and merge step would throw exceptions\r\n\r\n```\r\n2021-03-25 20:23:14,014 | INFO  | AsyncDispatcher event handler | Diagnostics report from attempt_1615883368881_0038_m_000000_0: Error:

pull request\r\nfix the bug that, HoodieCombineHiveInputFormat cannot build correct partition field.\r\n\r\nnow hudi use HoodieCombineHiveInputFormat to achieve Incremental query of the mor table.\r\nwhen we have some small files in different partitions(file1 from partition p=6 , file2 from partition p=7), HoodieCombineHiveInputFormat  will combine those small file readers.   HoodieCombineHiveInputFormat  build partition field base on  the first file reader(assume file1 reader which from parition p=6) , however now HoodieCombineHiveInputFormat  holds other file readers(file2 reader which from paritition p=7) which come from different partitions.\r\nWhen switching readers, we should  update ioctx\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/6e803e08b1328b32a5c3a6acd8168fdabc8a1e50/hudi-hadoop-mr/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hadoop/realtime/HoodieCombineRealtimeRecordReader.java#L73\r\n\r\n##

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull-request fixes the error messaging with the correct hoodie conf parameter.\r\n\r\nWhen you set your source_class as HoodieIncrSource and invoke deltastreamer without any checkpoint, it throws the following Exception:\r\n\r\n`User class threw exception: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Missing begin instant for incremental pull. For reading from latest committed instant set hoodie.deltastreamer.source.hoodie.read_latest_on_midding_ckpt to true`\r\n \r\nThe error messaging is wrong and misleading, the correct parameter is:\r\n`hoodie.deltastreamer.source.hoodieincr.read_latest_on_missing_ckpt`\r\n\r\nCheck out the correct parameter in this [file](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/release-0.7.0/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/sources/HoodieIncrSource.java#L78)\r\n \r\nThe correct messaging should be:\r\n\r\n`User class threw exception: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Missing begin instant for incremental pull. For reading from latest committed instant set hoodie.deltastreamer.source.hoodieincr.read_latest_on_missing_ckpt to true`\r\n\r\nOptions\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Updated the error messaging when using HoodieIncrSource class*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Committer

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nA Flink SQL table has DDL that defines the table schema, we can use that\r\nto infer the Avro schema and there is no need to declare a Avro schema\r\nexplicitly anymore.\r\n\r\nBut we still keep the config option for explicit Avro schema in case\r\nthere is corner cases that the inferred schema is not correct\r\n(especially for the nullability).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Modify `HoodieTableFactory` to support automatic schema inference for table source and sink\r\n  - Add UTs and modify existing ITCases using schema inference\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAdded UTs.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of

Hudi team!\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nWe need to upgrade to at least Avro 1.9.x in production so i tried upgrading the avro version in the pom.xml of Hudi. Doing so i noticed some problems:\r\n\r\nUpgrade to Avro 1.9.2:\r\n- Renamed method defaultValue to defaultVal\r\n- Moved NullNode.getInstance() to JsonProperties.NULL_VALUE\r\n- Avro complains about invalid schemas/default values in hudi-common/src/main/avro/\r\n- The shaded guava libs from Avro have been removed\r\n\r\nUpgrade to Avro 1.10.1:\r\n- Some more stuff (Not handled in this

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nBasic implement for spark sql  integrates with Hoodie.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nMain functions:\r\n-  Support create table for hoodie.\r\n-  Support  CTAS.\r\n-  Support Insert for hoodie. Including dynamic partition and static partition insert.\r\n-  Support MergeInto for hoodie.\r\n-  Support DELETE\r\n- Support UPDATE\r\n- Both support spark2 & spark3 based on DataSourceV1.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n- Add sql parser for spark2.\r\n- Add HoodieAnalysis for sql resolve and logical plan rewrite.\r\n- Add commands implementation for CREATE TABLE、INSERT、MERGE INTO & CTAS.\r\n- In order to push down the update&insert logical to the `HoodieRecordPayload` for MergeInto, I make same change to the\r\n  HoodieWriteHandler and other related classes.\r\n   1、Add the `inputSchema` for parser the incoming record.  This is because the inputSchema for MergeInto is different from writeSchema as there are some  transforms in the update& insert expression. \r\n  2、Add `WRITE_SCHEMA`  to `HoodieWriteConfig` to pass the write schema for merge into.\r\n  3、Pass `properties` to `HoodieRecordPayload#getInsertValue` to pass the insert expression and table schema.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Add TestCreateTable for test create hoodie tables and CTAS.\r\n- Add TestInsertTable for test insert hoodie tables.\r\n- Add TestMergeIntoTable for test merge hoodie tables.\r\n- Add TestUpdateTable for test update hoodie tables.\r\n- Add TestDeleteTable for test delete hoodie tables.\r\n- Add TestSqlStatement for test supported ddl/dml currently.\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n

https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n* Fix bug when HoodieMergeOnReadRDD read record from base file, Hoodie may set non-null value in field which is null if vectorization is enabled.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - When HoodieMergeOnReadRDD read record from base file,  will create new InternalRow base on requiredStructSchema.\r\n  - Hoodie doesn't check isNull when get value from all fields.\r\nIf vectorization is enabled, which  means row is ColumnarBatchRow.  ColumnarBatchRow may return non-null value even if value of field is null. So, hoodie may set non-null value in field which is null.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nfixed the bug that: Failed to query real-time view use hive/spark-sql when hudi mor table contains dateType\r\ntest step:\r\nstep1: prepare raw DataFrame with DateType, and insert it to HudiMorTable\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf_raw.withColumn(\"date\", lit(Date.valueOf(\"2020-11-10\")))\r\n\r\nmerge(df_raw, \"bulk_insert\", \"huditest.bulkinsert_mor_10g\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nstep2: prepare update DataFrame with DateType, and upsert into HudiMorTable\r\n\r\n```\r\n df_update = sql(\"select * from huditest.bulkinsert_mor_10g_rt\").withColumn(\"date\", lit(Date.valueOf(\"2020-11-11\")))\r\n\r\nmerge(df_update, \"upsert\", \"huditest.bulkinsert_mor_10g\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nstep3: use hive-beeeline/ spark-sql query mor_rt table\r\n\r\nuse `beeline/spark-sql`   execute   statement \r\n```\r\nselect * from huditest.bulkinsert_mor_10g_rt where primary_key = 10000000;\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the follow error will occur:\r\n\r\njava.lang.ClassCastExceoption: org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable cannot be cast to org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.io.DateWritableV2\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nwhen hudi read log file and convert avro INT type record to writable，logicalType is not respected which lead the dateType will cast to IntWritable。so cast avro INT type  to writable,  logicalType must be  considered\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\nExisting UT tests\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nLooks like we don't generate spark3 bundles at all(all artifacts in maven is for spark2). this patch is looking to fix it. \r\nAs of now, we are required to pass command line args while packaging as below.\r\n```\r\nmvn clean package -DskipTests -Dspark3 -Dscala-2.12\r\n```\r\nbut the issue with this approach is that, spark  bundle that gets created for both spark3_2.12 and spark2_2.12 has the same name. so, we can't differentiate in maven.  \r\n```\r\nhudi-spark-bundle_2.12-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n```\r\nIn this patch, modifying the bundle names depending on spark version. \r\n```\r\nhudi-spark2-bundle_2.12-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\nhudi-spark3-bundle_2.12-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n```\r\nrespectively for spark2 and spark3. \r\n\r\nSo, during release process, RM might have to deploy artifacts thrice. \r\n```\r\n./release/deploy_staging_jars.sh --scala_version=2.11 --spark_version=2\r\n./release/deploy_staging_jars.sh --scala_version=2.12 --spark_version=2\r\n./release/deploy_staging_jars.sh --scala_version=2.12 --spark_version=3\r\n```\r\nRunning the deploy thrice should be fine. Bcoz, even today we run it twice once for scala 11 and once for scala 12. so, common artifacts (which does not depend on scala version) will get overridden 2nd time, but its same as previous run as well. Only those artifacts which has _12 suffix will be added as new artifacts when deploy is called 2nd time. \r\n\r\nTo be discussed:\r\n1. I have introduced a new variable called `sparkbundle.version` to inject \"2\" or \"3\" with bundle name. If we were to resort to spark.version, artifact generated will be as follows. Not sure if we really need to reflect the actual spark version in artifact name. \r\n```\r\nhudi-spark2.4.4.-bundle_2.12-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\nhudi-spark3.0.0-bundle_2.12-0.8.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n```\r\n2. Do we need to stop uploading ```hudi-spark_2.12-0.7.0.jar``` since we also upload \r\n```hudi-spark2_2.12-0.7.0.jar``` and ```hudi-spark3_2.12-0.7.0-jar```. \r\nBasically we have all these for 0.7.0 in maven right now.\r\nhudi-spark_2.11-0.7.0.jar\r\nhudi-spark_2.12-0.7.0.jar\r\nhudi-spark2_2.11-0.7.0.jar\r\nhudi-spark2_2.12-0.7.0.jar\r\nhudi-spark3_2.12-0.7.0.jar\r\n\r\nProposal is to avoid uploading first 2 in the above list. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Fixed bundle names depending on spark versions.\r\n  - Fixed release script to take in spark version. \r\n\r\n## Verify this

pull request\r\n\r\n*Add support for pre-commit validation hooks through hive/presto queries. We provide mechanism to read uncommitted data through InputFormat. If validation passes, we will promote the commit. Otherwise, rollback the commit.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Add new consume mode: validate. In this consume mode, we allow reading dirty data. Users can run hive/presto queries, validate data and then commit/abort. Note that users also need to explicitly specify dirty commit time to use this API. (We can consider making this optional)\r\n* In the first version, only added support for COW tables and parquet format. If general approach looks good, i can extend support for other file formats/table types as a follow up.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nThis PR adds ability to:\r\n - Inject kafka meta information into the received data from avro kafka source, so users can track which kafka topic, partition, offset and the key delivered a specific record (super useful for debugging consistency issues). In SQL query user would need to specify <KAFKA_FIELDS> and enable appropriate options to enable the injection.\r\n - specify custom kafka avro data decoder that takes into account source latest schema and different schema versions.\r\n - cache retrieved source and target latest schemas\r\n - return null for the target schema if it is not in use by specifying \"null\" as a target schema url. (I know, there is NullTargetSchemaProvider, however it looks redundant).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Added kafka meta info injection\r\n - Kafka data deserializer can be swapped with a custom one.\r\n - source and target latest schema are optionally can being cached\r\n - if target schema url is set to \"null\", target schema will return null as a value forcing Hudi to infer the schema from the source one.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added unit tests for the components that were not originally covered.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently we use HoodieTableMetaClient#initTableType to init the table properties. As the number of Table Properties increases，It is hard to maintain the code for the initTableType method, especially when we want to add a new table property to the table config. Support Builder Pattern to build the table config properties can solve this problem.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add `PropertyBuilder` to build the table properties and init the table.\r\n  - Remove the origin `initTableType` method in `HoodieMetaClient`.\r\n  - Refactor all the code refer to `initTableType`\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit
