href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_gradle_module_metadata.html\">Gradle Module Metadata</a></h4>\n<p>The Gradle team has contributed a metadata file for Guava. If you use Gradle 6 or higher, you will see better handling of two kinds of dependency conflicts, plus another small feature related to our dependencies:</p>\n<h5>Selecting the appropriate flavor</h5>\n<p>When Gradle automatically selects the newest version of Guava in your dependency graph, it will now also select the appropriate flavor (<code>-android</code> or <code>-jre</code>) based on whether you project targets Android or not. For example, if you depend on 32.1.0-android and 30.0-jre, Gradle will select 32.1.0-jre. This is the version most likely to be compatible with all your dependencies.</p>\n<p>In the unusual event that you need to override Gradle's choice of flavor, you can do so as follows:</p>\n<pre lang=\"kotlin\"><code>dependencies.constraints {\n  implementation(&quot;com.google.guava:guava&quot;) {\n    attributes {\n      attribute(\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_gradle_module_metadata.html\">Gradle Module Metadata</a></h4>\n<p>The Gradle team has contributed a metadata file for Guava. If you use Gradle 6 or higher, you will see better handling of two kinds of dependency conflicts, plus another small feature related to our dependencies:</p>\n<h5>Selecting the appropriate flavor</h5>\n<p>When Gradle automatically selects the newest version of Guava in your dependency graph, it will now also select the appropriate flavor (<code>-android</code> or <code>-jre</code>) based on whether you project targets Android or not. For example, if you depend on 32.1.0-android and 30.0-jre, Gradle will select 32.1.0-jre. This is the version most likely to be compatible with all your dependencies.</p>\n<p>In the unusual event that you need to override Gradle's choice of flavor, you can do so as follows:</p>\n<pre lang=\"kotlin\"><code>dependencies.constraints {\n  implementation(&quot;com.google.guava:guava&quot;) {\n    attributes {\n      attribute(\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/releases\">lombok's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.18.16</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>BUGFIX: Version 1.18.14 could not be installed in Eclipse, it would break Eclipse.</li>\n<li>BREAKING CHANGE: mapstruct users should now add a dependency to lombok-mapstruct-binding. This solves compiling modules with lombok (and mapstruct).</li>\n<li>IMPROBABLE BREAKING CHANGE: The generated hashcode has changed for classes that include both primitive fields and reference fields.</li>\n<li>FEATURE: Similar to <code>@Builder</code>, you can now configure a <code>@SuperBuilder</code>'s 'setter' prefixes via <code>@SuperBuilder(setterPrefix = &quot;set&quot;)</code> for example. We still discourage doing this. [Pull Request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/2357\">#2357</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/pull/2357\">rzwitserloot/lombok#2357</a>).</li>\n<li>FEATURE: If using <code>@Synchronized(&quot;lockVar&quot;)</code>, if <code>lockVar</code> is referring to a static field, the code lombok generates no longer causes a warning about accessing a static entity incorrectly. [Issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/678\">#678</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/678\">rzwitserloot/lombok#678</a>)</li>\n<li>FEATURE: <code>@Jacksonized</code> on a <code>@Builder</code> or <code>@SuperBuilder</code> will configure <a href=\"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson\">Jackson</a> to use this builder when deserializing. [Pull Request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/2387\">#2387</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/pull/2387\">rzwitserloot/lombok#2387</a>) thanks to <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/JanRieke\"><code>@​JanRieke</code></a></strong>. <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/Jacksonized\"><code>@​Jacksonized documentation</code></a>.</li>\n<li>FEATURE: The checkerframework support has been updated; the relevant annotations were renamed in checkerframework's APIs, lombok now generates the annotations according to their current API names.</li>\n<li>PLATFORM: Added support for compiling projects with OpenJ9 [Pull Request <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/2437\">#2437</a>](<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/pull/2437\">rzwitserloot/lombok#2437</a>)</li>\n<li>PLATFORM: Improved support for recent JVM/javac versions (14 and 15) and new language features.</li>\n<li>PERFORMANCE: Several performance improvements during parsing/compilation, both using javac and Eclipse. Thanks <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Rawi01\"><code>@​Rawi01</code></a></strong>!</li>\n<li>PERFORMANCE: The generated equals method will first compare primitives, then primitive wrappers and then reference fields. Manual re-ordering is possible using <code>@Include(rank=n)</code>.

Now, it results in that exception but with a useful message attached (uses the same config as <code>@NonNull</code>), or alternatively via a parameter on <code>@Singular</code>, you can choose to ignore such a call (add nothing, return immediately); this can be useful when deserializing (e.g. Jackson JSON) and JPA/Hibernate code.
