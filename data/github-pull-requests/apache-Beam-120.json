hints allow pipeline authors, transform authors,  and pipeline users express desired resource constraints in transform execution environments. Resource hints interpretation will be provided by Beam runners and runners can ignore hints that they don't understand. To ensure good users experience, Beam SDK can define common resource hints, their URNs, parsing and merging logic.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a capability to express resource hints in and adds two example resource hints: \r\n- min_ram - minimum amount of memory that should be available to the transform execution environment.\r\n- accelerator - desired requirements for hardware accelerators that a runner should provision in transform's execution environment. \r\n\r\nFor more information, see:\r\n- [Mailing list

the `pack_combiners` optimizer phase by default in `FnApiRunner`. `pack_combiners` only packs combiners with the `APPLY_COMBINER_PACKING` annotation, so this will not result in any breaking changes for user pipelines.\r\n\r\nAlso create default factory methods for certain `Environment` subclasses so that the default Python capabilities are set correctly.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Python PR #14557\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n* Adds a new PipelineOption for sdkContainerImage, and marks WorkerHarnessContainerImage as deprecated.\r\n* Moves default image URL construction out of Option factory into DataflowRunner/DataflowRunnerInfo\r\n\t* Adds a project-level property for the base image repository, rather than hardcoding it\r\n\t* Separated imageName construction from replacement logic\r\n* Replaces runner v2 usage of workerHarnessContainerImage with sdkContainerImage \r\n* Unit test changes\r\n\t* Fixed DataflowRunnerInfo false-positive test ($ no longer part of property)\r\n* Replaced flag for runner v2 tests\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I didn't do:\r\n* Remove IMAGE replacement - I would like to do this, but technically if anyone provides an image with IMAGE in it right now, it will get replaced. This isn't a user-facing flag, so I don't think it will matter, but I would rather do it in a future PR in case we have to revert it. \r\n* Replace --workerHarnessContainerImage with --sdkContainerImage for legacy pipeline tests - this allows us to make sure the flag works as long as we support non-portable pipelines, and reduces the number of changes in this initial PR.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds the ability to attach a \"reason\" message to a Singleton partitioning requirement, and have that be included in the `NonParallelOperation` exception message, if raised. \r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n- I've gone through and added reasons for most of the Singleton requirements, I believe the only outstanding ones are those related to aggregation, which I intentionally left as TODOs because they will need to change after #14438.\r\n- Added some tooling in frames_test.py to check that any non-parallel operations verified there have a reason attached. \r\n- While working on this I realized that a few operations were raising incorrect errors, so I went ahead and updated them:\r\n  - `fillna(axis=index, limit=N)` is order-sensitive\r\n  - `shift(axis=index)` is order-sensitive\r\n  - `quantile(axis=columns)` is elementwise (no partitioning requirement)\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance status (on master

docs for `setup` method:\r\n\r\n1. It is not correct that it is called once per initialization; since it is not called at all when the initialization happens in the pipeline construction stage. I clarified that it's called during deserialization on the worker.\r\n2. The phrase \"setup need not to be cached, so it could be called more than once per worker.\" is completely unclear. Perhaps it is meant to be \"The objects created in setup need not be cached by the user because it is called whenever the DoFn instance is initialized\", but then the implication goes in the wrong direction. I removed it since it is hard to figure out what the intended meaning was. Instead I explained why this method may be called more than once per worker.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

follow-up PR for #14164. This PR tries to make the runner determined sharding implementation for unbounded data work with merging windows.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, if the windows of the input data need to be merged, we do an extra GBK to reify the window and follow the common path. So\r\n\r\ninput > key by destination > (optionally grouping) > reify window > shard and write to temp files > group by destination > finalize temp files\r\n\r\nDid some refactoring along the way to reused the existing code as much as possible.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the libraries-bom version to 20.0.0 along with gRPC and protobuf.\r\n\r\n# Changes in mock object setup in failed tests\r\n\r\nSome GCP-related tests failed. The latest google-http-client internally calls `getStatusCode()` twice per HTTP response. This change broke some tests where their mock setups had assumed that the method call occurs only once per request (and the tests were reusing the same mock response object for different responses). I updated the mock setup so that it now prepares different mock response objects for different responses.\r\n\r\n# Linkage Check\r\n\r\nNo new linkage errors. https://gist.github.com/suztomo/ac11c74fb24ebb8ac0e11791a8be11a9\r\n\r\nInitially it had problem with old gax-httpjson used by google-cloud-bigquerystorage ([log](https://gist.github.com/suztomo/dda7011d4dd8471289b0a7847e9afaf4#file-gistfile1-txt-L962)). Declaring gax-httpjson as a dependency of google-cloud-platform module fixed the linkage errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
