setup.cfg per <a href=\"https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/\">https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/</a></li>\n<li>Remove dependency on grpcio-tools. mypy-protobuf doesn't need it to run. It's only needed to run mypy afterward.</li>\n<li>Avoid relative imports in <code>_grpc_pb2.pyi</code> stubs. grpc stubs themselves don't use relative imports, nor <code>__init__.py</code> files</li>\n<li>Use <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> docstring style comments in generated code rather than <code>#</code> style so it shows up in IDEs.</li>\n<li>Disambiguate messages from reserved python keywords (eg <code>None</code>) with prefix <code>_r_</code> rather than <code>__</code> - since <code>__</code> is considered private.</li>\n<li>Bump tests to use pyright 1.1.169, types-protobuf 3.17.4, pytest 6.2.5, grpc-stubs 1.24.7, grpcio-tools 1.40.0</li>\n<li>Since upstream protobuf has dropped support with 3.18.0, 2.10 will be the last mypy-protobuf that supports targeting python 2.7. Updated docs for this.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.9</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/github/renaming\">Rename master branch to main</a></li>\n<li>Make <code>install_requires</code> requirements for grpcio-tools and types-protobuf use &gt;=</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.8</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Propagate comments from .proto files to .pyi files</li>\n<li>Add protobuf type stubs to the setup requirements</li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/nipunn1313/mypy-protobuf/issues/239\">#239</a> Remove type: ignore used in enum by pulling <code>V</code> into a separate class.</li>\n<li>Use pytest 6.2.4 for internal test suites on python3</li>\n<li>Remove <code>protoc_gen_mypy.bat</code> as the entry-points method creates protoc-gen-mypy.exe.

The goal is to make sure we capture a heap profile on any OOMs or other uncatchable panics from the worker process.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a profile produced by an integration test - https://pantheon.corp.google.com/storage/browser/temp-storage-for-end-to-end-tests/temp-validatesrunner-test/test13673/heapProfiles;tab=objects?prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false\r\n\r\nFixes #21797\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

collects a heap dump and uploads it to the temp_directory on Dataflow any time there is a worker panic before we exit. It departs from what #21797 recommends a little bit in that it doesn't use `GOTRACEBACK=crash` and instead relies on `debug.WriteHeapDump`. This is mostly because the GOTRACEBACK approach doesn't collect the dump until the top level Go routine exits with a panic - this currently isn't guaranteed to happen (and won't by default because we recover from panics and call os.exit), but if it did it would propogate up through boot.go. At that point, the VM is not guaranteed to be persisted (in fact, I think it will always be torn down), and this generally just breaks how we handle exiting. The approach of gathering the dump ourselves is also more in line with how Java handles this anyways - https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/4ffeae4d2b800f2df36d2ea2eab549f2204d5691/sdks/java/harness/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/fn/harness/status/MemoryMonitor.java#L589\r\n\r\nTo test this, I inserted a panic into the harness code and verified that a heap dump was correctly uploaded to the temp directory:\r\n\r\n- pipeline - https://pantheon.corp.google.com/dataflow/jobs/us-central1/2022-07-08_07_34_58-5641449712707134536;bottomTab=WORKER_LOGS;logsSeverity=INFO?project=google.com:clouddfe&pageState=(%22dfTime%22:(%22l%22:%22dfJobMaxTime%22))\r\n- dumps from multiple pipeline runs - https://pantheon.corp.google.com/storage/browser/clouddfe-test/dannymccormick-tmp/heapDumps?pageState=(%22StorageObjectListTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%255D%22))&project=google.com:clouddfe&prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false)\r\n\r\nFixes #21797\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

I'm not sure if this is a big enough deal to worry about?\r\n- Rather than worry about synchronization at all, push all add/remove/sample operations into a queue and have a single thread consuming from it and maintaining activeTrackers and doing the sampling. Doing so removes the race above and simplifies the logic a lot (I think). I used the LMAX Disruptor queue to handle the multi-consumer-single-producer setup here, but you could probably use a built-in java concurrent blocking queue for this as well.\r\n\r\nBenchmark results are as follows:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1882981/178150077-64f9aac3-45bd-428f-9240-74a5951540c2.png)\r\n\r\nThe machine I was running these tests on has 24 logical cores, which is why we see a big drop in throughput between 20 -> 50 threads.\r\n\r\nBoth the LMAX and stock (synchronized) implementations have a significant throughput dropoff after the number of cores is saturated.  The synchronized one due to lock contention, and the LMAX one due to the disruptor queue filling up (because the worker thread gets scheduled out).\r\n\r\nThe ConcurrentSet implementation seems the best here, with no scalability dropoff after core saturation.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note: I was still unable to reproduce the significant blocking I saw in a real dataflow job with the JMH benchmarks, even at 100 threads the contention was very low (~1 second of blocked threads over a 1 minute sample, vs 30 seconds over a 1 minute sample in dataflow).\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to #21690 and #21895 (and originally #17112).\r\n\r\nThe timestamp skew override required as part of the bug fix in #21895 was added to the wrong DoFn, which resulted in the reintroduction of #21885 in v2.40.0.  This PR corrects that error.\r\n\r\nThis change was validated against a high-volume production workload by deploying 2.40.0, intentionally waiting to see that `Output timestamps must be no earlier than the timestamp of the current input` errors occur, updating that same pipeline with a JAR of the ES module built from the beam repo (`./gradlew :sdk:java:io:elasticsearch:jar`), and finally observing that the errors no longer occur and previously failing work items pass through the pipeline.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#22171\r\n\r\nThis adds a parallelizable custom implementation of `DeferredSeries.mean`, which uses `sum()/count()`. In addition:\r\n- `DeferredDataFrame` leverages this implementation through `_agg_method`\r\n- Updates tests which previously verified that mean is _not_ parallelizable. Added new tests for `mean(skipna=False)`.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

response to Jenkins going down (https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21824), we disabled most of our comment triggers.\r\n\r\nSince then, we believe that we've gotten a handle on what is causing the issue and have mitigated it by disabling many bot comments from the ghprb plugin (see https://lists.apache.org/thread/x6mx3o1tkf1299ssw7l63y37lfpw1zmp for context).\r\n\r\nThis reenables all comment triggers in a single easily revertable PR to reenable this workflow.\r\n\r\nFixes #22168 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

fixes `ProxyInvocationHandler.as`, `DoFnSignatures.getSignature`, and `ByteBuddyDoFnInvokerFactory.getByteBuddyInvokerConstructor` from #22161\r\n\r\nThe fixes to DoFnSignatures and ByteBuddyDoFnInvokerFactory are trivially changing a Map to ConcurrentHashMap.\r\n\r\nProxyInvocationHandler is more involved, since multiple data structures must be updated atomically on a cache miss.  To do this we extract the relevant structures into an immutable class.  On a cache miss we construct a new instance of it with new (also immutable) copies of the updated structures.  The trade-off here is slightly more garbage creation on a cache miss (since it needs to copy the structures rather than mutate them), however since in steady-state misses ~never occur, and the structures here in question are generally small (~100s of elements).\r\n\r\nThe impact of these changes is very significant, without these changes my test job spends ~30% of its time in the \"start bundle\" state, after these changes (as well as ExecutionStateSampler), the % time goes down to ~1-2%.\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of changes:\r\n- Add tests to verify compatibility with Spark 3.2 and 3.3 (3.1.2 remains the default).\r\n- Use correct group for Dropwizard `metrics-core`. While package names remained the same, modules have moved to a new group `io.dropwizard.metrics`. This group is also used by Spark and leads to rather indeterministic behavior when loading classes as outdated classes of the old group remain on the classpath.\r\n -  Recent versions of Dropwizard `MetricRegistry` do not allow registering arbitrary implementations of `Metric`s. Migrate to using `Gauge`.\r\n- Spark `Sink`s have different constructors between 3.1 and later versions. Using reflection here is fine as there's just one sink per executor.\r\n- Change encoders/expressions for StructuredStreamingRunner to use reflection where necessary. The overhead of this is rather low as it's just necessary once to build the execution plan.\r\n- Change StructuredStreamingRunner to allow using a provided / active Spark Sessions for tests. This was critical to fix the broken tests for the metrics integration. On shutdown Spark will stop the metrics system, after that point it's not possible to query any metrics (from the in-memory sink) anymore.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is an edge case when Beam issues multiple rewrites to a GCS bucket. A bundle that rewrites files can succeed, but the fact of its success may not persist in Beam (e.g. autoscaling workers, worker restart). On bundle retry, the rewrite is issued again with the same destination. If this happens when writing to a bucket with a retention policy, we will run into the retentionPolicyNotMet error.\r\n\r\nPR adds support for this case by handling the retentionPolicyNotMet error as such:\r\n- If source and destination files have the same checksum, assume they are identical and skip the rewrite\r\n- otherwise, throw an early error\r\n\r\nMore information in this design document:
