Builds off of the work accomplished under [[BEAM-13685]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13685)\r\n- Modified interactive_environment.py to support caching to a bucket on GCS for batch processing pipelines\r\n- If a specified bucket does not exist, the pipeline will terminate and return an error specifying that the bucket does not exist\r\n- Added cleanup() functionality to cache_manager.py, to enable the FileBasedCacheManager class to automatically delete cached values on GCS when a bucket path is specified\r\n- Added docstring to interactive_beam.py with an example of GCS path assignment\r\n- Cached files on GCS will be stored under a directory represented by the value of id(pipeline).\r\n  - Example cached path: gs://my-gcs-bucket/cache/dir/id(pipeline)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

bundles return a 200 status code even if entries fail, which results in us only incrementing the success counter and not the failure counters, even if all entries are failed to be written to the FHIR store. (Meanwhile, transaction bundles - which is all FhirIO has been tested with, return a non-20X HTTP response if *any* of the entries don't succeed).\r\n\r\nTherefore, need to add parsing and metrics around this to be able to support bundles of type BATCH.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the SpannerIO.readChangeStreams feature that will enable users to consume a change stream from Cloud Spanner.\r\nThis feature is under preview now, and can only be used for allowlisted customers.\r\n\r\nWhen reading a change stream the users will be able to operate on a PCollection of DataChangeRecords, containing the modifications made to the database as well as the type of operation.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following modifications:\r\n\r\n1. It exposes the `SpannerIO.readChangeStream(...)` functionality. Here we construct the internal pipeline composed of `Impulse -> Initialize -> DetectNewPartitions -> ReadChangeStreamPartition -> PostProcessingMetrics`.\r\n2. It adds a DoFn to create the metadata table when the pipeline is deployed. This will be used to maintain internal state for the Connector. It can be seen in the `InitializeDoFn` class.\r\n3. The `InitializeDoFn` uses a new class called `NameGenerator` that creates a random metadata table name to be used within the Connector.\r\n4. It adds a DoFn to collect metrics as a final step in the Connector, the `PostProcessingMetricsDoFn`. This class will count the number of DataRecords produced, the stream time of a record from Cloud Spanner to the worker, and the total time that a record took from commit time in Spanner until it is emitted into the output PCollection.\r\n5. Small bug fixes that changes the initial watermark timestamp from the current timestamp to the partition's start at timestamp.","created_at":"2022-01-21T05:32:26Z","updated_at":"2022-01-31T22:48:27Z","closed_at":"2022-01-31T22:00:03Z","merged_at":"2022-01-31T22:00:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"91738cbf60912173715311a8e1c3729c0930f34b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/16581/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/16581/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/16581/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/a11e3f89c9f6ecd67f162e97626ca7e656908f53","head":{"label":"thiagotnunes:spanner-io-change-streams","ref":"spanner-io-change-streams","sha":"a11e3f89c9f6ecd67f162e97626ca7e656908f53","user":{"login":"thiagotnunes","id":302813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjgxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes","html_url":"https://github.com/thiagotnunes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thiagotnunes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"19b06fa76ad7cea8a7b4afbacddf586c55d61ce2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50904245,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDkwNDI0NQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"apache/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam","description":"Apache

a cross-language Beam pipeline that runs SQL transforms in the Go SDK. Serves as both an example for users on how to use the sql package as well as a proven case of the SQL cross-language transforms functioning end-to-end. This is an example rather than an integration test as the SQL transforms need a fully stood-up expansion service to run, not just the test expansion service used in xlang integration tests.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

2.35)\r\n\r\nWhen outputting to lots of files (one file per PCollection element), Beam creates many GcsPath objects.  Each object validates the bucket name that it will be writing to, which tends to create a lot of memory allocation.   When this allocation occurs, the GC kicks in and spends a lot of time moving memory around, which results in The MemoryMonitor kicking in and killing the process.  In my experience, typically the MemoryMonitor kills the instance even when ample memory is available, primarily because the GC more active than normal.   This change attempts to allocate less garbage by caching the Regex, and thus avoid the overactive GC.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started off by noticing my jobs typically dying in the final stage of Writing the output files, typically due to MM.   Profiling the jobs directly with Async Profiler revealed the source of the allocation coming from GcsPath, using the uncached String regex.  A sample of the error, and the Async Profiler output has been included for posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloud Dataflow log line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nShutting down JVM after 8 consecutive periods of measured GC thrashing.

pipeline failed when I added the newly supported [JSON column](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/working-with-json) to a Spanner table.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure if it requires more adjustments to the source code, but at this point, my pipeline is not actually reading the value of a JSON column from a Spanner table, or performing a write mutation on a JSON column.  It looks like it still fails because the full table schema has to be read for the purposes of serialization.  For now, I just want to resolve the following exception.\r\n\r\n```\r\nError message from worker: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown spanner type JSON\r\n  org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.spanner.SpannerSchema$Column.parseSpannerType(SpannerSchema.java:179)\r\n  org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.spanner.SpannerSchema$Column.create(SpannerSchema.java:142)\r\n  org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.spanner.SpannerSchema$Builder.addColumn(SpannerSchema.java:74)\r\n  org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.spanner.ReadSpannerSchema.processElement(ReadSpannerSchema.java:63)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't normally contribute to this repository, so let me know if there's any other information that I should provide! 🙏 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the return type of the ptransform_fn is not specified, [certain typecheckers](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/2688#issuecomment-990238720) will assume the type signature of functions decorated with it remain unchanged. However, ptransform_fn specifically adjusts the type signature such that the function no longer takes a pcoll.\r\n\r\nThis can be corrected by changing the the definition of ptransform_fn from:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef ptransform_fn(fn):\r\n```\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef ptransform_fn(fn) -> Callable[..., _PTransformFnPTransform]: \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows the typechecker to understand the return type of a function decorated with ptransform_fn will instead be a _PTransformFnPTransform type.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for Python 3.10, [ParamSpec](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0612/#parameter-specification-variables) could be used to preserve the signature of the internal function as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom typing import ParamSpec, TypeVar, Concatenate\r\n\r\nP = ParamSpec(\"P\")\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\r\nR = TypeVar(\"R\")\r\n\r\ndef ptransform_fn(fn: Callable[Concatenate[PCollection[T], P], R]) -> Callable[[P], _PTransformFnPTransform]: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
