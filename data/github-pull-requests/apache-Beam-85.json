Background\r\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/datasets lets users create versioned datasets for training machine learning (ML) models on raw multimedia data (text, images, audio, video), and [it integrates wonderfully with Beam](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/beam_datasets) (and Dataflow).\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nA current pain point in the user journey is that in order to use `tfds.features.Audio` or `tfds.features.Video`, the worker runtime has to have `ffmpeg` available which means that `setup.py` hackery (with `apt-get` commands within it), or prebuilding your own image with e.g. Google Cloud Build is necessary. This significantly worsens the UX for ML engineers who expect that a requirements.txt mentioning `librosa` and `apache_beam` should suffice. Frustrations are especially exacerbated by the fact that DirectRunner development usually just works (since many have `ffmpeg` or equivalent on their development machines), and that these issues surface quite late at runtime.\r\n\r\n## Solution?\r\nThus, I'm curious if we couldn't just include `ffmpeg` in Beam's Docker Hub hosted images, with the goal of making it easier to create large audio and video datasets.

there's two different versions of AWS IO connectors in Beam for the Java SDK:\r\n\r\n* [amazon-web-services](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/java/io/amazon-web-services) and [kinesis](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/java/io/kinesis) for the AWS Java SDK v1\r\n* [amazon-web-services2](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/java/io/amazon-web-services2) (including kinesis) for the AWS Java SDK v2\r\n\r\nThis deprecates IOs in both, the  `amazon-web-services` and `kinesis` module in favor of the `amazon-web-services2` module and closes #21249.\r\n\r\nAfter a few Beam releases both, the `amazon-web-services` and `kinesis` module will

we used `RowTypeConstraint` for typehints inferred from `beam.Row`, while we still used the actual typehint to represent schemas inferred from `NamedTuple` types. As we continue to build out Python schema infrastructure, it will be helpful to have a single representation for a schema in Python, including native representations for various metadata (e.g. options) as well as the type that user code uses to represent this schema.\r\n\r\nThis PR standardizes on `RowTypeConstraint` as that representation. Now `typing_from_runner_api` and `typing_to_runner_api` produce and consume `RowTypeConstraint` instances.\r\n\r\nNote there's no Issue for this PR as it's an internal change that shouldn't impact users. Instead it lays the groundwork for future work, such as:\r\n- #22082: Encode the user type in the schema with sdk_options.\r\n- #22083: Add a representation for Beam Schema options in RowTypeConstraint.\r\n- #22084: Make `RowTypeConstraint` creation part of normalizing typehints. Note this would effectively opt-in pipelines that use any supported types (NamedTuples, and in the future Dataclasses/TypedDicts) to using SchemaCoder for those PCollections, so it should be done with care.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[![Build python source distribution

change defines a new exec.ReStreamFactory type for constructing a\r\nre-iterable stream from a byte stream and coder.Coder. The user may override the\r\ndefault behavior by calling exec.SetReStreamFactory.\r\n\r\nThis customizable factory function allows overriding the default behavior of\r\nexec.ReStream construction. The default implementation buffers all elements bein\r\niterated over by a GBK or CoGBK function into an in-memory buffer, which may\r\ncause OOM errors when a single iterable is large and the runner does not supply\r\na state-backed iterable. See https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21817. The\r\nuser may specify an alternative function that spills elements to disk if a\r\nmemory threshold is exceeded, for instance.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#22008 \r\n\r\nAddresses DEADLINE_EXCEEDED flakiness by testing for \"at least\" rather than…\"exactly\" the number of retries. \r\n\r\nRandomness in the FluentBackoff implementation empirically allows (with current defaults) the number of actual retries in this test to drift between 8 and 10 retries. Other approaches to making this test deterministic (e.g. by setting the random number generator seed or explicitly specifying a maximum number of retries) would likely require fairly substantial refactoring of the SpannerIO configuration as none of these parameters appear to be plumbed through at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#22000\r\n\r\n0de98210f4531fbfd88265bc02052b27bd299602 introduced a regression when a FlatMap produced an instance of an iterable type that raises an error in `__bool__`, like numpy arrays. The regression was just caused by a trivial cleanup, which is reverted here.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

short id once during instantiation instead of during each progress report. This clean-up has a tiny impact on the bundle benchmarks as can be seen:\r\nBefore this change:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                Mode  Cnt     Score      Error  Units\r\nProcessBundleBenchmark.testLargeBundle  thrpt   25  1155.848  ±   7.517  ops/s\r\nProcessBundleBenchmark.testTinyBundle   thrpt   25  28858.064 ±  98.341  ops/s\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this change:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                Mode  Cnt     Score      Error  Units\r\nProcessBundleBenchmark.testLargeBundle  thrpt   25  1155.204  ±   9.236  ops/s\r\nProcessBundleBenchmark.testTinyBundle   thrpt   25  29000.767 ± 195.753  ops/s\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe perf profiles show a better change of CPU usage reduction since the above benchmarks also include the runner side setup and JMH overhead:\r\n* -0.587% for processBundle on larger bundles\r\n* -0.282% for processBundle on smaller bundles\r\n\r\nFuture work would be to update msec counters which are also on the hot path and reduce the cost of state tracking.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed an issue where we were not handling the case where there were no PCollection consumers which missed out on PCollection element sizing for PCollections that don't have any consumers.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

was bumped to 0.3.5.1 last month. With this version, there were no issues pickling the classes defined in `pytorch_language_modeling.py` during development. However, since we only recently reverted `dill` back to `0.3.1.1`, and haven't had a chance to test `pytorch_language_modeling.py` till `apache_beam==2.40.0rc1` was released, we didn't realize that dill version `0.3.1.1` has issues with pickling some of the classes. See error [here](https://gist.github.com/yeandy/4c51243213e24eef9417ff386b24cd0e)\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Move the wrapper class outside of the `run()` function. This example now works for the current dill package `dill==0.3.1.1`.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: I tested a hacky solution by adding the following code to `pytorch_language_modeling.py`.\r\n```\r\nfrom apache_beam.internal import pickler\r\npickler.set_library('cloudpickle')\r\n```\r\nBut this is not good practice, so I went with the change in this PR.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-22T18:54:10Z","updated_at":"2022-06-23T15:15:39Z","closed_at":"2022-06-23T15:06:23Z","merged_at":"2022-06-23T15:06:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"44cff50e324bd0c875e7f2d5fa1c08ac1bbdc04f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1738121359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzM4MTIxMzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/python","name":"python","color":"e2d35d","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1839394135,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM5Mzk0MTM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/examples","name":"examples","color":"e0e00b","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/22001/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/22001/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/22001/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/56c6820754d4dae7272f72842f4da331dbb573c2","head":{"label":"yeandy:dill_error_in_bert_example","ref":"dill_error_in_bert_example","sha":"56c6820754d4dae7272f72842f4da331dbb573c2","user":{"login":"yeandy","id":14128880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTI4ODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14128880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy","html_url":"https://github.com/yeandy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":438710089,"node_id":"R_kgDOGiYvSQ","name":"beam","full_name":"yeandy/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yeandy","id":14128880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTI4ODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14128880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy","html_url":"https://github.com/yeandy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yeandy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yeandy/beam","description":"Apache

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.22.0</h2>\n<h1>NumPy 1.22.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>NumPy 1.22.0 is a big release featuring the work of 153 contributors\nspread over 609 pull requests. There have been many improvements,\nhighlights are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annotations of the main namespace are essentially complete. Upstream\nis a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,\nbut the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible\nenhancement in this release.</li>\n<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is\na step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be\nused across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>\n<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange\nformat for array (tensor) data.</li>\n<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions. The\nnew methods provide a complete set of the methods commonly found in\nthe literature.</li>\n<li>A new configurable allocator for use by downstream projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are in addition to the ongoing work to provide SIMD support for\ncommonly used functions, improvements to F2PY, and better documentation.</p>\n<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.8-3.10, Python 3.7\nhas been dropped. Note that 32 bit wheels are only provided for Python\n3.8 and 3.9 on Windows, all other wheels are 64 bits on account of\nUbuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions dropping 32 bit support.\nAll 64 bit wheels are also linked with 64 bit integer OpenBLAS, which should fix\nthe occasional problems encountered by folks using truly huge arrays.</p>\n<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>\n<h3>Deprecated numeric style dtype strings have been removed</h3>\n<p>Using the strings <code>&quot;Bytes0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Datetime64&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Str0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Uint32&quot;</code>,\nand <code>&quot;Uint64&quot;</code> as a dtype will now raise a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19539\">gh-19539</a>)</p>\n<h3>Expired deprecations for <code>loads</code>, <code>ndfromtxt</code>, and <code>mafromtxt</code> in npyio</h3>\n<p><code>numpy.loads</code> was deprecated in v1.15, with the recommendation that\nusers use <code>pickle.loads</code> instead. <code>ndfromtxt</code> and <code>mafromtxt</code> were both\ndeprecated in v1.17 - users should use <code>numpy.genfromtxt</code> instead with\nthe appropriate value for the <code>usemask</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19615\">gh-19615</a>)</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

#21950 \r\nR: @damondouglas \r\n\r\nWe could not determine the reason why we were re-creating this state. It was this way since the inception of this file in October. Back then it did not matter because there were no async operations.\r\n\r\nClasses like `PlaygroundState` should either be:\r\n1. Mutable controllers, and persist throughout the life cycle of a parent widget, or\r\n2. Immutable states emitted by some other business logic unit.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `PlaygroundState` is a mix of the two. Here we are making it (1).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/spf13/cobra/releases\">github.com/spf13/cobra's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.5.0</h2>\n<h2>Spring 2022 Release 🌥️</h2>\n<p>Hello everyone! Welcome to another release of cobra. Completions continue to get better and better. This release adds a few really cool new features. We also continue to patch versions of our dependencies as they become available via dependabot. Happy coding!</p>\n<h2>Active help 👐🏼</h2>\n<p>Shout out to <a href=\"https://github.com/marckhouzam\"><code>@​marckhouzam</code></a> for a big value add: Active Help <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1482\">spf13/cobra#1482</a>. With active help, a program can provide some inline warnings or hints for users as they hit tab. Now, your CLIs can be even more intuitive to use!</p>\n<p>Currently active help is only supported for bash V2 and zsh. Marc wrote a whole guide on how to do this, so make sure to give it a good read to learn how you can add this to your cobra code! <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/active_help.md\">https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/active_help.md</a></p>\n<h2>Group flags 🧑🏼‍🤝‍🧑🏼</h2>\n<p>Cobra now has the ability to mark flags as required or exclusive as a <strong><em>group</em></strong>. Shout out to our newest maintainer <a href=\"https://github.com/johnSchnake\"><code>@​johnSchnake</code></a> for this! <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1654\">spf13/cobra#1654</a> Let's say you have a <code>username</code> flag that <em><strong>MUST</strong></em> be partnered with a <code>password</code> flag. Well, now, you can enforce those as being required together:</p>\n<pre lang=\"go\"><code>rootCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&amp;u, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Username (required if password is set)&quot;)\nrootCmd.Flags().StringVarP(&amp;pw, &quot;password&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Password (required if username is set)&quot;)\nrootCmd.MarkFlagsRequiredTogether(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Flags may also be marked as &quot;mutally exclusive&quot; with the <code>MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive(string, string ... )</code> command API. Refer to our <a href=\"https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/user_guide.md\">user guide documentation</a> for further info!</p>\n<h2>Completions 👀</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add backwards-compatibility tests for legacyArgs() by <a href=\"https://github.com/marckhouzam\"><code>@​marckhouzam</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1547\">spf13/cobra#1547</a></li>\n<li>feat: Add how to load completions in your current zsh session by <a href=\"https://github.com/ondrejsika\"><code>@​ondrejsika</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1608\">spf13/cobra#1608</a></li>\n<li>Introduce FixedCompletions by <a href=\"https://github.com/emersion\"><code>@​emersion</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1574\">spf13/cobra#1574</a></li>\n<li>Add shell completion to flag groups by <a href=\"https://github.com/marckhouzam\"><code>@​marckhouzam</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1659\">spf13/cobra#1659</a></li>\n<li>Modify brew prefix path in macOS system by <a href=\"https://github.com/imxw\"><code>@​imxw</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1719\">spf13/cobra#1719</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): use backslash escape string expansion for tab by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1682\">spf13/cobra#1682</a></li>\n<li>style(bash-v2): out is not an array variable, do not refer to it as such by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1681\">spf13/cobra#1681</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): standard completion optimizations by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1683\">spf13/cobra#1683</a></li>\n<li>style(bash): out is not an array variable, do not refer to it as such by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1684\">spf13/cobra#1684</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): short-circuit descriptionless candidate lists by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1686\">spf13/cobra#1686</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): speed up filtering entries with descriptions by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1689\">spf13/cobra#1689</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): speed up filtering menu-complete descriptions by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1692\">spf13/cobra#1692</a></li>\n<li>fix(bash-v2): skip empty completions when filtering descriptions by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1691\">spf13/cobra#1691</a></li>\n<li>perf(bash-v2): read directly to COMPREPLY on descriptionless short circuit by <a href=\"https://github.com/scop\"><code>@​scop</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1700\">spf13/cobra#1700</a></li>\n<li>fix: Don't complete _command on zsh by <a href=\"https://github.com/twpayne\"><code>@​twpayne</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1690\">spf13/cobra#1690</a></li>\n<li>Improve fish_completions code quality by <a href=\"https://github.com/t29kida\"><code>@​t29kida</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1515\">spf13/cobra#1515</a></li>\n<li>Fix handling of descriptions for bash v3 by <a href=\"https://github.com/marckhouzam\"><code>@​marckhouzam</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1735\">spf13/cobra#1735</a></li>\n<li>undefined or nil Args default to ArbitraryArgs by <a href=\"https://github.com/umarcor\"><code>@​umarcor</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1612\">spf13/cobra#1612</a></li>\n<li>Add Command.SetContext by <a href=\"https://github.com/joshcarp\"><code>@​joshcarp</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1551\">spf13/cobra#1551</a></li>\n<li>Wrap printf tab with quotes by <a href=\"https://github.com/PapaCharlie\"><code>@​PapaCharlie</code></a> in <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spf13/cobra/pull/1665\">spf13/cobra#1665</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Documentation 📝</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed typos in completions docs -

PR addresses #21412 by producing a [PubsubTransformToRow](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/pubsub/PubsubMessageToRow.java) from a

design goals of `PubsubSchemaTransformMessageToRowFactory` in this PR are to replicate logic in the existing [PubsubSchemaIOProvider](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/pubsub/PubsubSchemaIOProvider.java) and provide
