clarity of reading.\r\n\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is introduce statically compiled regular expressions, as opposed to the current way the code uses regular expressions, which is to compile them every time the code path is traversed. This is done inside the String class source code.\r\n\r\nUsing statically compiled patterns like this helps avoid creating unnecessary objects, requiring less memory and cpu time to execute the same things.\r\n\r\nAll refactors were done based on the Java Oracle JDK8 source code.\r\n\r\nYou might notice some missing `Matcher.quoteReplacement()` calls. This is because the JDK8 source code for that method is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static String quoteReplacement(String s) {\r\n        if ((s.indexOf('\\\\') == -1) && (s.indexOf('$') == -1))\r\n            return s;\r\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\r\n        for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {\r\n            char c = s.charAt(i);\r\n            if (c == '\\\\' || c == '$') {\r\n                sb.append('\\\\');\r\n            }\r\n            sb.append(c);\r\n        }\r\n        return sb.toString();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd as you can see, the first condition checks for the presence of a backslash and dollar sign. If both are not present, the original string is returned, unedited. So in most cases, it was omitted.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

WorkerSinkTaskContext to only resume the consumer topic partitions when the connector/task is not in the paused state.\r\n\r\nThe context tracks the set of topic partitions that are explicitly paused/resumed by the connector, and when the WorkerSinkTask resumes the tasks it currently resumes all topic partitions *except* those that are still explicitly paused in the context.

is a general change and is re-requisite to allow streams benchmark test with different streams tests. For the streams benchmark itself I will have a separate PR for switching configs. Details:\r\n\r\n1. Create a \"streams.properties\" file under PERSISTENT_ROOT before all the streams test. For now it will only contain a single config of state.dir pointing to PERSISTENT_ROOT.\r\n2. For all the system test related code, replace the main function parameter of state.dir with propsFilename, then inside the function load the props from the file and apply overrides if necessary.\r\n3. Minor fixes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

segments created before the patch for KAFKA-5413 could have messages with offsets greater than baseOffset + Integer.MAX_VALUE. This could cause the offset and time index to overflow, and could also cause various other side effects (for example, compaction could fail for such segments).\r\n\r\nThis patch includes a workaround for this issue by loosening some checks when trying to append to the index, or when the log cleaner is trying to clean such a segment. We now allow the cleaner to continue processing such segments, but make sure we do not append an index entry corresponding to messages that could cause index overflow. Because we only skip append for the last bit of the segment that causes overflow, from a correctness point-of-view, skipping append to offset and time index should be okay.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do have an implicit assumption that time index contains (maximum_timestamp_in_log, offset_of_maximum_timestamp) as its last entry on clean shutdown / log close -- this assumption would not always remain true with this patch. This means, on log open, in addition to reading the last entry in the time index, we also need to scan all messages after the offset in the last entry to make sure we know the exact (maximum_timestamp_in_log, offset_of_maximum_timestamp).\r\n\r\nNote that we continue maintaining the time and offset index accurately for segments not affected by KAFKA-5413.\r\n\r\n### Committer

introduces a system test where we do a rolling bounce upgrade of streams application instances against a fixed broker version. Each broker version starting with `0.10.2` up to `trunk` is tested.  Streams applications start at `0.10.2` and do rolling upgrades up to `trunk` then do rolling downgrades back to `0.10.2`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes a new utility class for Streams systems tests `StreamsTest` which extends `KafkaTest` and provides some convenience methods for working with `VerifiableProducer` and `VerfiiableConsumer` and validating results in log files.\r\n\r\nThere are other system tests `streams_standby_replica_test.py` and `streams_broker_down_resilience_test.py` using common functionality that can be pulled out and extend the `StreamsTest` class instead.  I'll do that in a follow-on PR.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Since the base class `StreamsTest` only exists in this PR so far, I've refactored the other tests as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nI tested this by running branch builder https://jenkins.confluent.io/job/system-test-kafka-branch-builder/1430/\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-12T18:34:21Z","updated_at":"2024-07-10T13:58:05Z","closed_at":"2018-03-22T23:02:17Z","merged_at":"2018-03-22T23:02:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"286216b56e27d8db18f7268b63cbd8d7f8bd8830","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/4690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/4690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/3dcfe8e0f2f18bdbdbcc96517ae38538e62f2697","head":{"label":"bbejeck:MINOR_rolling_streams_upgrades_fixed_broker","ref":"MINOR_rolling_streams_upgrades_fixed_broker","sha":"3dcfe8e0f2f18bdbdbcc96517ae38538e62f2697","user":{"login":"bbejeck","id":199238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck","html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42054236,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjA1NDIzNg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"bbejeck/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbejeck","id":199238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTIzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck","html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbejeck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbejeck/kafka","description":"Mirror

builder\r\n\r\nTrogdor WorkerManager, NodeManager, TaskManager changes:\r\n* Worker status should be a JsonNode, not just a string\r\n* TaskManager should track the status of all workers, and combine that into a\r\ncomplete task status.\r\n* Be more verbose when handling exceptions in TaskWorker#start\r\n\r\nTrogdor WorkerUtils#createTopics changes:\r\n* Retry after getting InvalidReplicationFactorException, to avoid racing with\r\nbroker startup.\r\n* Add a sleep in the topic creation retry loop.\r\n* Increase topic creation timeout\r\n\r\nTrogdor ProduceBenchWorker test changes:\r\n* The background Executor should have more than 1 thread, so that the periodic\r\nStatusUpdater task can run while the other test tasks are running.\r\n\r\nSoakTool cloud directory:\r\n* Interfaces for bringing up cloud nodes and running remote commands there\r\n\r\nSoakTool cluster directory:\r\n* Objects which represent the cluster as a whole\r\n\r\nsoak/common/JsonTransformer: performs string search and replace JSON objects.\r\n\r\nsoak/common/NullOutputStream: an output stream which drops all its output.\r\n\r\nsoak/common/SoakConfig: soak tool configuration keys\r\n\r\nsoak/common/SoakLog: a log object which implements slf4j interfaces, and can\r\nredirect output to a file, stdout, or another

PR is the first pass on the topology optimization effort. Here's a guide to the changes and the order of the list is meant to imply a possible review order.  \r\n\r\n1. `StreamsTopolgyGraphImpl` - This class is used to build the graph, record any metadata to be used later during the topology building process. Some stubbed out code to that end is already present\r\n2. `TopologyOptimizerImpl` - This class traverses the graph and uses information contained in a `StreamGraphNode` to make calls to the `InternalTopologyBuilder` to construct the topology.  It's at this point any optimizations will be applied.\r\n3. `StreamsBuilder` -  The `StreamsBuilder#build` method has been modified to call `InternalStreamdBuilder#buildAndOptimize` to build topology.\r\n4. `InternalStreamsBuilder` - Contains a reference to the `StreamsTopologyGraph` added a methods `InternalStreamsBuilder#addNode`  and `InternalStreamsBuilder#buildAndOptimize` `InternalStreamsBuilder` is the only intermediary for building the graph from the DSL.\r\n5. `KStreamImpl`, `KTableImpl`, `KGroupedStream` and `KGroupedTable` and others have been refactored to create `StreamGraphNode` instances and place topology information in the graph vs. calling `InternalTopologyBuilder`.\r\n6. `StreamsGraphNode` and sub-classes are used to contain information from the DSL calls.  IMHO this is the part of the PR so far that needs the most refactoring work from me, but these are merely container objects so the refactoring should be straightforward.  I plan on updating the PR with updates to these classes soon.\r\n\r\nSome other notes:\r\n1. I have not added units test for the new code (will be added soon).  But IMHO the fact that the framework is used to handle all DSL operations, I feel that all of our current tests passing suffice for the moment.\r\n2. Due to depreciation, I have not included the `KStreamsBuilder` in this initial PR.  I can do so, but I think this takes us a step backward regarding separation of DSL and PAPI.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade
