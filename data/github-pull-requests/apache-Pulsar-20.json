What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\nI may have discovered a method in the newest version of [pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar), which has \"Observable Timing Discrepancy\" vulnerability. The vulnerability is located in the method org.apache.pulsar.broker.authentication.SaslRoleTokenSigner.verifyAndExtract(String signedStr) . The vulnerability bears similarities to a recent CVE disclosure https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-54g4-5cf6-hjp3 in the \"apache/hive\" project.\r\nThe source vulnerability information is as follows:\r\n> ‚Äã\t**Vulnerability Detail:**\r\n>\r\n> ‚Äã\t**CVE Identifier:** CVE-2020-1926\r\n>\r\n>  \t**Description**:Apache Hive cookie signature verification used a non constant time comparison which is known to be vulnerable to timing attacks. This could allow recovery of another users cookie signature. The issue was addressed in Apache Hive 2.3.8.\r\n>\r\n> ‚Äã\t**Reference:**https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1926\r\n>\r\n> ‚Äã\t**Patch**: https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/ee5a6be81a87bb21b3779edad6e61b67b365997b\r\n\r\n\r\n**Vulnerability Description**: The vulnerability exists within the String verifyAndExtract(String signedStr) method of the org.apache.pulsar.broker.authentication.SaslRoleTokenSigner class. It is responsible for authenticating and extracting SaslRoleToken. SaslRoleToken is a token used for authentication and authorization, which contains a signed string of information about roles and permissions.**But the authentication snippet is similar to the vulnerable snippet for CVE-2020-1926 and may have the same consequence as CVE-2020-1926, where isvulnerable to timing attacks.** Therefore, maybe you need to fix the vulnerability with much the same fix code as the  CVE-2020-1926 patch.\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\nI fix it by replacing `String.equals` with `MessageDigest.isEqual`\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\n**This change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.**\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20934\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIf the consumer receives a chunked message, it currently couldn't retry it or send it to the DLQ. It will throw an exception like this:\r\n```\r\njava.util.concurrent.CompletionException: org.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClientException$InvalidMessageException: The producer xxx of the topic persistent://a/b/c sends a message with 8085120 bytes that exceeds 5242880 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because we don't enable the chunking for the retry producer and the DLQ producer in the consumer.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables the chunking feature for retry and DLQ producers. However, we cannot enable both chunking and batching simultaneously. Therefore, the trade-off of this change is that we have to turn off the batching for the DLQ producer, while the retry producer has already done so. This is acceptable because the DLQ producer usually has low traffic. It does not have a significant impact on the performance.\r\n\r\nThis PR also addresses the following two issues:\r\n\r\n### Issue A: Consumers cannot redeliver chunked messages\r\nWhen the consumer attempts to redeliver a chunked message, the message ID is reconstructed in `discardBatch`, which causes this message ID to lose the chunk information. The comparison in the `unAckedChunkedMessageIdSequenceMap` will fail. The consumer will never be able to redeliver chunked messages.\r\n\r\nWe should not reconstruct the chunked message ID in `discardBatch`. The chunk message ID does not contain any batch information.\r\n\r\n### Issue B: The chunked message cannot be resent\r\nWhen the producer resends the chunked message, the chunk id in the message metadata of all subsequent chunks will be set to the last chunk id.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that the producer shares the same MessageMetadata for all chunks in a chunked message.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/4634311e75176f9acec16e37e2900945a8e2040e/pulsar-client/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/client/impl/ProducerImpl.java#L696-L700\r\n\r\nTherefore, when `op.rePopulate` is called, the chunk id in `finalMsgMetadata` is pointed to the last chunk. Suppose we have a large message with 3 chunks. The producer may end up sending all 3 messages with the same chunk id `3`. The consumer will treat these messages as corrupted and ignore them, preventing it from receiving any of these messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Modification\r\n- Enable chunking and disable batching for retry and DLQ producers.\r\n- Don't discard the batch for the chunked message ID to fix Issue A.\r\n- Don't redeliver the chunk message ID itself when redelivering unacked messages. Just need to redeliver the message ID for all single chunks.\r\n- Reset the chunkID when resending the chunk message to fix Issue B.\r\n- Add chunk messages test case for `testDeadLetterTopic`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#20968 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/6297296/fd19894b-6df2-4164-9724-d6c620954769)\r\n\r\nAs described in 20968, even if the retention policy is set at the topic level, the ledger is still deleted. See the above log.\r\n\r\nFor `onUpdate` , there are two issues: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/ee91edc3e08c87db1e5662a553ff62af0c1886e5/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentTopic.java#L3493-L3522\r\n\r\n1.  We print `Policies updated successfully` in method `checkReplicationAndRetryOnFailure`. it confuses users.\r\n2.  If the topic is loaded before `reader` read the policies and `checkPersistencePolicies` throw exception, then the retention policy will not apply to ManagedLedger config. So trim ledger will still use previous polices.  And here will cause the above issue.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n1. print `Policies updated successfully` in the end.\r\n2. Use `thenCompose ` to call async method. \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nAfter [PIP-118: reconnect broker when ZooKeeper session expires](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/13341), the Broker will not shut down after losing the connection of the local metadata store in the default configuration.\r\n\r\nHowever, before the ZK client is reconnected, the events of BK online and offline are lost, resulting in incorrect BK info in the memory. You can reproduce the issue by the test `BkEnsemblesChaosTest. testBookieInfoIsCorrectEvenIfLostNotificationDueToZKClientReconnect`(90% probability of reproduce of the issue, run it again if the issue does not occur)\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nRefresh BK info in memory after the ZK client is reconnected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

issue #20734\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe current implementation has the following issues:\r\n1. `managedLedgerOffloadMaxThreads` is a broker level parameter . In the situation of using assignmentScheduler in a filesystem offloader, this is not reasonable. \r\n2. `managedLedgerOffloadMaxThreads` and `managedLedgerOffloadPrefetchRounds` always default values as #20734 described.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n1. add a new config: `managedLedgerAssignmentOffloadThreads` use for filesystem-offloader's assignmentScheduler to adjust thread number.\r\n2. support admin api to adjust `managedLedgerOffloadMaxThreads` and `managedLedgerOffloadPrefetchRounds` while set-offload-policies.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn certain deployments, it is preferable to be able to disable the `/proxy-stats`, `/metrics`, and `/status.html` endpoints.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Add configuration named `enableProxyStatsEndpoints` to the proxy configuration. When true (default), the endpoints are all exposed. When false, they are not served.\r\n* Fix some implementation details for the proxy stats servlet configuration and the endpoints themselves\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a minor

Motivation\r\n\r\nCalling these two method synchronously to set the retention and ttl of one topic will result into unexpected results.\r\n```\r\nadmin.topics().setRetention\r\nadmin.topics().setMessageTTL\r\n```\r\nFor example, if we call \r\n```\r\nint retentionTimeInMinutes = 2880;\r\nint messageTTLInSecond = retentionTimeInMinutes * 60;\r\nadmin.topics().setRetention(topic,new RetentionPolicies(retentionTimeInMinute, -1));\r\nadmin.topics().setMessageTTL(topic, messageTTLInSecond);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe expect that the retention is set to 2880 minutes, ttl is set to `2880*16=172800` seconds. But the result is that the retention policy is null !\r\nWe read the messages from `__change_events` derectly and find out the reason:\r\n```\r\nTimeStamp:1692157480789 ,Message received: PulsarEvent(eventType=TOPIC_POLICY, actionType=UPDATE, topicPoliciesEvent=TopicPoliciesEvent(, policies=TopicPolicies(backLogQuotaMap={}, subscriptionTypesEnabled=[], persistence=null, **retentionPolicies=RetentionPolicies{retentionTimeInMinutes=2880, retentionSizeInMB=-1},** deduplicationEnabled=null, **messageTTLInSeconds=null**, maxProducerPerTopic=null, maxConsumerPerTopic=null, maxConsumersPerSubscription=null, maxUnackedMessagesOnConsumer=null, maxUnackedMessagesOnSubscription=null, delayedDeliveryTickTimeMillis=null, delayedDeliveryEnabled=null, offloadPolicies=null, inactiveTopicPolicies=null, dispatchRate=null, subscriptionDispatchRate=null, compactionThreshold=null, publishRate=null, subscribeRate=null, deduplicationSnapshotIntervalSeconds=null, maxMessageSize=null, maxSubscriptionsPerTopic=null, replicatorDispatchRate=null)))\r\n\r\nTimeStamp:1692157480811 ,Message received: PulsarEvent(eventType=TOPIC_POLICY, actionType=UPDATE, topicPoliciesEvent=TopicPoliciesEvent(, policies=TopicPolicies(backLogQuotaMap={}, subscriptionTypesEnabled=[], persistence=null, **retentionPolicies=null**, deduplicationEnabled=null, **messageTTLInSeconds=172800**, maxProducerPerTopic=null, maxConsumerPerTopic=null, maxConsumersPerSubscription=null, maxUnackedMessagesOnConsumer=null, maxUnackedMessagesOnSubscription=null, delayedDeliveryTickTimeMillis=null, delayedDeliveryEnabled=null, offloadPolicies=null, inactiveTopicPolicies=null, dispatchRate=null, subscriptionDispatchRate=null, compactionThreshold=null, publishRate=null, subscribeRate=null, deduplicationSnapshotIntervalSeconds=null, maxMessageSize=null, maxSubscriptionsPerTopic=null, replicatorDispatchRate=null)))\r\n```\r\nWe can see that the retention policy in the second message is null, which result into the null retention policy. \r\n\r\nDiving into the implementation of `SystemTopicBasedTopicPoliciesService`, we can see that `org.apache.pulsar.broker.service.SystemTopicBasedTopicPoliciesService#updateTopicPoliciesAsync` returns as soon as the message is written into `__change_events`, but do not guranteen that the topic policy in cache is updated. However, topic policy setting api will retrieve the topic policy from cache.\r\n```\r\norg.apache.pulsar.broker.admin.v2.PersistentTopics#setRetention\r\norg.apache.pulsar.broker.admin.v2.PersistentTopics#setMessageTTL\r\n```\r\nBefore the cache is updated, the second rest api for setting ttl arrived, and change the topic policy based on the old one, which result into the problem.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nThe solution is:  Ensure policy cache is updated before updateTopicPoliciesAsync returns.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nRight now after we mark the topic migrated, replicators do not get disconnected from blue cluster and subscriptions are not deleted even after the backlog is drained and all consumers are disconnected. This pr takes care of this by asynchronously disconnecting replicators and deleting subscriptions once the backlog is drained and all consumers are disconnected when checkClusterMigration API is called.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nReplicators without backlog are disconnected and subscriptions without consumers are deleted and eventually topic is garbage collected in the blue cluster.\r\n\r\nCall checkAndDisconnectReplicators() and checkAndUnsubscribeSubscriptions() in checkClusterMigration() periodic job.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to verify the change\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nChunk messages can be effectively filtered on the broker side. Ensure that chunk messages work normally after enabling deduplication and the topic has no duplicate chunks.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n1. Add `chunkIDPushed` and `chunkIDPersisted` to store the chunk of each producer`s ongoing chunk messages. It will be used to check whether the chunks in a single message are duplicated.\r\n2. Optimize the `properties` of the `MarkDeleteEntry` from `Map<String, Long>` to `Map<String, String>`.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#21024 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nModify the process of update topic policy. \r\n\r\nMake topic policy can be updated correctly when user use pulsar-admin to set policy \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. Construct a new topicPolicy in internalSetRetention(), which make sure we do not update the value of policiesCache in two area. We only update policiesCache by SystemTopicBasedTopicPoliciesService#refreshTopicPoliciesCache\r\n2. All the method about update topicPolicy in pulsar-admin,  should respond success to client after policy is actually updated in policiesCache. \r\n3. Retry in isRetentionUpdateSuccess(), because systemTopicReader maybe can not immediately read next PulsarEvent message.\r\n4. Improve the test in TopicPoliciesTest to make the test cover more complicated pulsar-admin operation. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nPulsar saves all bundles load informations in `loadData` which contains bundleData, \r\nthe broker will update the bundleData by traversing all LocalBrokerData reported by every broker and remove non-active bundles (found in loadData but not in the newest reported LocalBrokerData)\r\n\r\nthe current removing of non-active happens in the wrong place, see\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/loadbalance/impl/ModularLoadManagerImpl.java#L540-L571\r\n\r\nit removes non-active bundle for every broker\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nfix the non-active bundle clean logic when updating bundles.\r\n\r\nremove non-active bundle  after traverse brokers bundle data\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Motivation\r\nWhen the user config `-Dbookkeeper.metadata.client.drivers=org.apache.pulsar.metadata.bookkeeper.PulsarMetadataClientDriver`, the AutoRecovery will use PulsarLedgerUnderreplicationManager.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/f30ff4f2ad4778f1f73b29872e2a95adb22ca116/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/replication/Auditor.java#L396-L397.\r\n\r\nIn Auditor start, it will register a UnderReplicatedLedgersChangedCb to PulsarLedgerUnderreplicationManager,\r\nPulsarLedgerUnderreplicationManager will register a watcher to watch the zk event. \r\n\r\nWhen the event path matches `underreplication`, callback UnderReplicatedLedgersChangedCb, the callback executor is metadata-store executor.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/0cb1c780412ca3cc1d421fe6ebb5de95cf7392fa/pulsar-metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/metadata/impl/AbstractMetadataStore.java#L307-L323\r\n\r\n\r\nIn UnderReplicatedLedgersChangedCb, it will get all the `underreplication` ledgers from the metadata store, and this is a sync operation. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/f30ff4f2ad4778f1f73b29872e2a95adb22ca116/bookkeeper-server/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/replication/Auditor.java#L561-L569\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/0cb1c780412ca3cc1d421fe6ebb5de95cf7392fa/pulsar-metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/metadata/bookkeeper/PulsarLedgerUnderreplicationManager.java#L427-L479\r\n\r\nline_448, use future.get(), it's sync.\r\n\r\nThere is the stack file:\r\n[jastack.txt](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/files/12366413/jastack.txt)\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe UnderReplicatedLedgersChangedCb is aim to record metrics, it is unnecessary and brings heavy pressure for the zookeeper, so here we cancel the UnderReplicatedLedgersChangedCb.\r\nAnd we discuss to revert \r\n UnderReplicatedLedgersChangedCb,.https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/pull/2805#pullrequestreview-1581866097\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\nExposing topic-level metrics costs a lot of CPU and memory for brokers and put heavy traffic pressure on Prometheus to pull metrics, especially when the Pulsar cluster has thousands of topics. To address this issue, we can disable the topic-level metrics by default and enable it when some topics encountered any issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `exposeTopicLevelMetricsInPrometheus` flag is not dynamic and we need to change the broker configuration and restart all the brokers to enable or disable the flag.\r\n\r\nWe can make the `exposeTopicLevelMetricsInPrometheus` flag dynamic to avoid restarting all the brokers when enabling or disabling the flag\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nMake the following flags dynamic\r\n- exposeTopicLevelMetricsInPrometheus\r\n- exposeConsumerLevelMetricsInPrometheus\r\n- exposeProducerLevelMetricsInPrometheus\r\n- exposeManagedLedgerMetricsInPrometheus\r\n- exposeManagedCursorMetricsInPrometheus\r\n- exposePreciseBacklogInPrometheus\r\n- exposeSubscriptionBacklogSizeInPrometheus\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Remove duplicate validation logic and useless tests\r\n4. Remove `AwsCredentialProviderPlugin`, `AwsDefaultProviderChainPlugin` and `STSAssumeRoleProviderPlugin` class, These classes have long been deprecated, and there is no place to use them.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n- Add `missCloudWatchEndpointTest` to cover `awsRegion` and `cloudwatchEndpoint` is empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIf a batch contains a message with a null value (i.e. payloadSize == 0) and `PhaseOneResult.from` haven't been set, then the compactor may skip the whole batch message according to `PhaseOneResult.from` in phase two, which will lead to message loss during the topic compact. The root cause is `deletedMessage` of whole batch be marked `true` when the batch contains one message with a null value.\r\n\r\nAlso, `PhaseOneResult.to` has the same problem, when finding the value of the message is null, `PhaseOneResult.to` will not be updated.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/98628845aa94b416b0c3711b5a15819ade549c57/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/compaction/TwoPhaseCompactor.java#L126-L166\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Fix `deletedMessage` calculate in the batch message,  just when delete times are equal to the number of messages in the batch to mark `deletedMessage=true`.\r\n\r\n* Don't extract message with null key in phase one, since messages with null keys should be retained intact.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nLoad balance module in pulsar broker pose greate pressure on zk, because broker will write and read lots of znode corresponding to every bundle. As there are hundreds of thousands of bundles in clusters, broker will write and read hundreds of thousands of znode, which pose greate pressure on zk.\r\n\r\n**As All Load Shedding Algorithm pick bundles from top to bottom based on throughput/msgRate, bundles with low throughput/msgRate can barely be selected for shedding. So there is no need to update these bundleData to zk frequently.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nadd configuration:\r\n```\r\n    @FieldContext(\r\n            dynamic = true,\r\n            category = CATEGORY_LOAD_BALANCER,\r\n            doc = \"minimum throughput in of bundle to be considered for updating data in metadata store\"\r\n    )\r\n    private int loadBalancerBundleThroughputThresholdInByte = 0;\r\n\r\n    @FieldContext(\r\n            dynamic = true,\r\n            category = CATEGORY_LOAD_BALANCER,\r\n            doc = \"minimum message rate in of bundle to be considered for updating data in metadata store\"\r\n    )\r\n    private int loadBalancerBundleMsgThreshold = 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's see the effect:\r\nFirst, analyze the throughput distributions of bundles in cluster.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/52550727/e1a400a5-c027-48fb-91f9-6d20864138c1)\r\nThere are about 1k bundles in the cluster, but there are only 24 bundles whose throughput in is higher than 1MB. There are more than 80% bundles whose throughput in is lower than 0.1MB, which is barely useful in shedding algorithm.\r\nSo we can configure broker.conf:\r\n```\r\nloadBalancerBundleThroughputThresholdInByte=100*1024  # 100Kb\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults as follows:\r\n<img width=\"945\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/52550727/50825aee-f919-417c-9735-cf393738dea1\">\r\nTotal write throughput to /loadbalance namespace of zk decrease from 8kb/s to 3kb/s.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/52550727/92fddecd-a9e2-4f3c-99d7-338058314ea3)\r\n\r\nUpdate Latency decrease from 200ms to 4ms!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"950\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/52550727/bc08ca28-09ba-40dd-89c3-3e0f3b5c2227\">\r\n<img width=\"638\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/52550727/40a22f3b-a44b-4eac-9135-b479d52bca20\">\r\n\r\nAs the write throughput decrease, the read throughput and latency will also decrease significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\n**Background**: when calling `pulsar-admin topics stats --get-earliest-time-in-backlog <topic name>`, Pulsar will read the first entry which is not acknowledged, and respond with the

centralized way.  Most of the time, leader broker take the responsibility of shedding and assignning, while followers update their load data to zk for leader. Leader broker retrieve load data of all brokers in the cluster to make decision. \r\n**But, i found that not only leader will retrieve all load data (include LocalBrokerData and BundleData), but also followers, which is unnecessary and pose greate pressure to zk.**\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nDisable load data retrieve for followers.\r\n\r\nResult as follows, only the zk instance that serve for leader broker present high throught.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/52550727/d7c13024-a8b0-437b-afdf-a101ecf52b8e)\r\nThe peak total read traffic of the zk cluster has decreased from 24kb/s to 10kb/s.\r\n<img width=\"956\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/pulsar/assets/52550727/c9be33b3-0f17-4805-b85a-acd2a57152cd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#20934 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\nWe encountered an issue when chunked messages had to be retried, like\r\n```\r\norg.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClientException$InvalidMessageException: The producer mdl-pulsar-0-12 of the topic part-v1 sends a message with 7094331 bytes that exceeds 5242880 bytes\r\n```\r\nbecause retry letter and dead letter producers never enable chunking. Our chunked messages may be very large, so simply increasing the maximum is probably not a good option.\r\n\r\nThis change allows the client to set if they want chunking and batching for these produces. The properties are separated in retry letter and dead letter, since currently the retry letter disables batching while the dead letter enables it implicitly. (So, we did not want a single pair of new properties to always set them to the same value.)\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\nEdited the DeadLetterPolicy to add these new fields, and the ConsumerImpl to pick them up in the consumer and when creating the producers.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added unit test for setting the new fields, including one checking the defaults\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Unfortunately, the dedup system consumer(for the dedup map recovery) is usually behind the latest position -- the broker takes deup recovery map snapshot every 1000 entry(by default, `brokerDeduplicationEntriesInterval`) or every 2 mins(by default) when `brokerDeduplicationEnabled` is enabled(default is false), so before the next snapshot cycle, the dedup system consumer's MarkDeletePos is usually behind, and this can hold backlog more than the quota. As a result, the dedup-enabled topic could show more backlog size and block produce creations, especially when there is no producer and the time-based dedup-map snapshot is disabled, although all of the actual consumers' MarkDeletePos are up-to-date.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\nAdd `advanceSlowestMessageDeduplicationCursor` in the backlogQuotaCheck failure handler to advance the Slowest MessageDeduplication Cursor when the backlog quota exceeds the threshold.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n```\r\n# local repro steps\r\nbin/pulsar-admin tenants create my-tenant\r\nbin/pulsar-admin namespaces create my-tenant/my-namespace-3 --bundles 5\r\nbin/pulsar-admin namespaces set-backlog-quota my-tenant/my-namespace-3 -l 1K -p producer_request_hold\r\nbin/pulsar-admin namespaces set-deduplication my-tenant/my-namespace-3 --enable\r\n\r\n# on another console\r\nbin/pulsar-client consume -s sub-read persistent://my-tenant/my-namespace-3/my-topic -p Earliest -n 0 --hide-content\r\n\r\n# on another console, try multiple times until hit\r\nbin/pulsar-perf produce persistent://my-tenant/my-namespace-3/my-topic -r 100 -bm 1 -mk random -n 1 \r\n```\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\nAdded the unit test to cover this logic change.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nMake the chunk message function work properly when deduplication is enabled.\r\n## Modification\r\n### Only check and store the sequence ID of the last chunk in a chunk message.\r\n For example:\r\n ```markdown\r\n     Chunk-1 sequence ID: 0, chunk ID: 0, total chunk: 2\r\n     Chunk-2 sequence ID: 0, chunk ID: 1\r\n     Chunk-3 sequence ID: 1, chunk ID: 0 total chunk: 3\r\n     Chunk-4 sequence ID: 1, chunk ID: 1\r\n     Chunk-5 sequence ID: 1, chunk ID: 1\r\n     Chunk-6 sequence ID: 1, chunk ID: 2\r\n```   \r\nOnly store check and store the sequence ID of Chunk-2 and Chunk-6.\r\n**Add a property in the publishContext to determine whether this chunk is the last chunk when persistent completely.**\r\n```java\r\npublishContext.setProperty(IS_LAST_CHUNK, Boolean.FALSE);\r\n```\r\n### Filter and ack duplicated chunks in a chunk message instead of discarding ctx.\r\n For example:\r\n ```markdown\r\n     Chunk-1 sequence ID: 0, chunk ID: 0, msgID: 1:1\r\n     Chunk-2 sequence ID: 0, chunk ID: 1, msgID: 1:2\r\n     Chunk-3 sequence ID: 0, chunk ID: 2, msgID: 1:3\r\n     Chunk-4 sequence ID: 0, chunk ID: 1, msgID: 1:4\r\n     Chunk-5 sequence ID:

Motivation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/14248 fix rackaware placement policy does not take effect after delete rack configuration. But after https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/16825, this fix is ineffective when delete zk rack info after bkclient initialize. \r\n\r\nThe reason is \"register available bookie\" is after \"BookieRackAffinityMapping#setConf\" in bookieClient constructor. So updateRacksWithHost(racksWithHost) would throw BookieIdNotResolvedException, make \"racksWithHost\" become null. \"racksWithHost\" is updated until \"watchAvailableBookies()\" listener is trigger.\r\n\r\nI add some log of unittest testRackUpdate() to show the order of bookieClient constructor:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-08-07T15:47:23,540+0800 [main] INFO  org.apache.pulsar.bookie.rackawareness.BookieRackAffinityMapping -

#20934 \r\nPIP 293\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change. What is the problem you're trying to solve. -->\r\nWe encountered an issue when chunked messages had to be retried, like\r\n```\r\norg.apache.pulsar.client.api.PulsarClientException$InvalidMessageException: The producer mdl-pulsar-0-12 of the topic part-v1 sends a message with 7094331 bytes that exceeds 5242880 bytes\r\n```\r\nbecause retry letter and dead letter producers never enable chunking. Our chunked messages may be very large, so simply increasing the maximum is probably not a good option.\r\n\r\nThis change allows the client to set if they want chunking and batching for these produces. The properties are separated in retry letter and dead letter, since currently the retry letter disables batching while the dead letter enables it implicitly. (So, we did not want a single pair of new properties to always set them to the same value.)\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\nEdited the DeadLetterPolicy to add these new fields, and the ConsumerImpl to pick them up in the consumer and when creating the producers.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added unit test for setting the new fields, including one checking the defaults\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen I did this test below and got the error \"Topic not found\".\r\n\r\n```java\r\npulsarAdmin.topics().createNonPartitionedTopic(\"persistent://public/default/tp_1\");\r\nConsumer consumer = null;\r\nConsumer consumer = pulsarClient.newConsumer()\r\n          .topic(\"persistent://public/default/tp_1\")\r\n          .subscriptionName(\"s1\")\r\n          .enableRetry(true)\r\n          .subscribe();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI do create the topic `persistent://public/default/tp_1` first but got a response \"Topic not found\", it is confusing. \r\n\r\nThe root cause is the retry letter topic `persistent://public/default/tp_1-sub1-RETRY` was not created. \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nclear the vague response if the topic is not founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO

Motivation\r\n\r\nOccasionally there is an ack hole in the cursor for geo-replication. The following is the internal stats for the topic where the problem occurred:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"entriesAddedCounter\" : 11000,\r\n  \"numberOfEntries\" : 6999,\r\n  \"totalSize\" : 362285,\r\n  \"currentLedgerEntries\" : 6999,\r\n  \"currentLedgerSize\" : 362285,\r\n  \"lastLedgerCreatedTimestamp\" : \"2023-07-30T16:17:10.137+09:00\",\r\n  \"waitingCursorsCount\" : 1,\r\n  \"pendingAddEntriesCount\" : 0,\r\n  \"lastConfirmedEntry\" : \"1687807:6998\",\r\n  \"state\" : \"LedgerOpened\",\r\n  \"ledgers\" : [ {\r\n    \"ledgerId\" : 1687807,\r\n    \"entries\" : 0,\r\n    \"size\" : 0,\r\n    \"offloaded\" : false,\r\n    \"underReplicated\" : false\r\n  } ],\r\n  \"cursors\" : {\r\n    \"pulsar.repl.cluster-a\" : {\r\n      \"markDeletePosition\" : \"1687807:6002\",\r\n      \"readPosition\" : \"1687807:6999\",\r\n      \"waitingReadOp\" : true,\r\n      \"pendingReadOps\" : 0,\r\n      \"messagesConsumedCounter\" : 10942,\r\n      \"cursorLedger\" : 1687808,\r\n      \"cursorLedgerLastEntry\" : 13,\r\n      \"individuallyDeletedMessages\" : \"[(1687807:6060..1687807:6998]]\",\r\n      \"lastLedgerSwitchTimestamp\" : \"2023-07-30T16:17:10.143+09:00\",\r\n      \"state\" : \"Open\",\r\n      \"numberOfEntriesSinceFirstNotAckedMessage\" : 997,\r\n      \"totalNonContiguousDeletedMessagesRange\" : 1,\r\n      \"properties\" : { }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"schemaLedgers\" : [ ],\r\n  \"compactedLedger\" : {\r\n    \"ledgerId\" : -1,\r\n    \"entries\" : -1,\r\n    \"size\" : -1,\r\n    \"offloaded\" : false,\r\n    \"underReplicated\" : false\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, the following log was printed on the broker server. The ack hole is included in the range where the cursor was rewound.\r\n```\r\n16:50:11.787 [pulsar-io-24-1] INFO  o.a.b.mledger.impl.ManagedCursorImpl - [massakam/test/persistent/t1-pulsar.repl.cluster-a] Rewind from 1687807:6061 to 1687807:5999\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis problem occurred in the following situations:\r\n- There are two replication clusters, cluster-a and cluster-b\r\n- cluster-a usually has no producers or consumers, but once a day a producer connects and publishes messages\r\n- Only consumers are connected to cluster-b\r\n- Retention time is 0\r\n\r\nIn the above case, the producer for geo-replication on the cluster-a side will be closed after a certain period of time by GC.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/ca01447fb4df808f8e2da2dc75d44fad0b780032/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentTopic.java#L2626\r\n\r\nHowever, at this time, an already triggered operation to read new entries will not be cancelled. This operation will remain pending until new entries are available.\r\n\r\nThen 24 hours later the user's producer connects again and publishes messages. This triggers the pending operation and causes the replicator to start reading new entries.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the producer for geo-replication has not yet been restarted, these read entries will be dropped without being acknowledged.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/ca01447fb4df808f8e2da2dc75d44fad0b780032/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/GeoPersistentReplicator.java#L138-L149\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, since the user's producer is connected, the producer for geo-replication is also restarted and the cursor is rewound. After that, the state of the replicator is changed to `Started`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/ca01447fb4df808f8e2da2dc75d44fad0b780032/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentReplicator.java#L138-L145\r\n\r\nAt this time, one of the operations triggered before the cursor is rewound succeeds, causing `readPosition` to move to \"the position next to the successfully read entry\". Entries before this position will not be read again. As a result, entries that have been read once but not acknowledged will be left as an ack hole.\r\n\r\nIn short, a race condition between \"cursor rewinding when the producer for geo-replication is restarted\" and \"an read operation that was triggered the last time geo-replication occurred\" is what causes this issue.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd a flag named `waitForCursorRewinding` to the `PersistentReplicator` class. Normally this value is false. If this value becomes true, the replicator will no longer call `cursor.asyncReadEntriesOrWait`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, set `waitForCursorRewinding` to true at the beginning of the `readEntries` method that is executed when restarting the producer for geo-replication. Then wait until at least one of the following conditions is met:\r\n- `state` is no longer `Starting`\r\n  - This means the replicator has been stopped\r\n- `havePendingRead` becomes `FALSE`\r\n  - This means there are no reads in progress\r\n- `cursor.cancelPendingReadRequest` returns true\r\n  - This means that there was a read in progress, but it was successfully canceled\r\n\r\nThen change `state` to `Started`, rewind the cursor, and set `waitForCursorRewinding` back to false. This prevents a read triggered before the cursor has been rewound from advancing the cursor again, leaving an ack hole.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nRight now, when we mark topic migrated during blue-green cluster migration then broker disconnects consumers of the subscriptions once it reaches end of managed-leger data and consumer will be redirected to green cluster. However, if consumer is connected to topic without any backlog then consumer stays connected and broker didn't trigger consumer migration. Therefore, this PR makes sure that all the consumers of subscriptions which are not having backlog will be migrated and broker also checks topic migration when new consumer connects and notifies those consumers immediately if there is no backlog on that subscription.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. Add a function \"checkAndApplyTopicMigration\" to check and disconnect consumers if subscription is already migrated under Consumer.java. \r\n2. Call the function in checkClusterMigration() periodic job in PersistentTopic.java\r\n3.  Call the function in ServerCnx.java when new consumer tries to connect.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to verify the change\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nDuring the process of creating a subscription, when checking if the transaction pending has been initialized using `return store.exists(PREFIX + path);`, a connection failure error

simple changes (comments at this point) that would enable native golang concurrency within Pulsar functions.\r\n\r\nThis would mean a function would behave as it normally does, but it can ingest more

Motivation\r\n\r\nFix the perf-producer to get direct memory OOM with high publish latency.\r\nThe root cause is the perf-producer without any memory limitation and pending\r\nqueue size limitation by default.\r\n\r\nYou can try to set the max pending queue size for a workaround. \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nUse the default configuration of the PulsarClient instead of removing the memory\r\nlimitation in pulsar-perf.\r\n\r\nWe should also provide an option to specify the max memory for the perf tool.\r\nBut it will introduce new public API changes to the perf tool, so it should only be available\r\nin the feature release. This PR is focused on the BUG fix to avoid confusing users\r\nwith OOM.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

The following is the internal stats for the topic where the problem occurred:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"entriesAddedCounter\" : 11000,\r\n  \"numberOfEntries\" : 6999,\r\n  \"totalSize\" : 362285,\r\n  \"currentLedgerEntries\" : 6999,\r\n  \"currentLedgerSize\" : 362285,\r\n  \"lastLedgerCreatedTimestamp\" : \"2023-07-30T16:17:10.137+09:00\",\r\n  \"waitingCursorsCount\" : 1,\r\n  \"pendingAddEntriesCount\" : 0,\r\n  \"lastConfirmedEntry\" : \"1687807:6998\",\r\n  \"state\" : \"LedgerOpened\",\r\n  \"ledgers\" : [ {\r\n    \"ledgerId\" : 1687807,\r\n    \"entries\" : 0,\r\n    \"size\" : 0,\r\n    \"offloaded\" : false,\r\n    \"underReplicated\" : false\r\n  } ],\r\n  \"cursors\" : {\r\n    \"pulsar.repl.cluster-a\" : {\r\n      \"markDeletePosition\" : \"1687807:6002\",\r\n      \"readPosition\" : \"1687807:6999\",\r\n      \"waitingReadOp\" : true,\r\n      \"pendingReadOps\" : 0,\r\n      \"messagesConsumedCounter\" : 10942,\r\n      \"cursorLedger\" : 1687808,\r\n      \"cursorLedgerLastEntry\" : 13,\r\n      \"individuallyDeletedMessages\" : \"[(1687807:6060..1687807:6998]]\",\r\n      \"lastLedgerSwitchTimestamp\" : \"2023-07-30T16:17:10.143+09:00\",\r\n      \"state\" : \"Open\",\r\n      \"numberOfEntriesSinceFirstNotAckedMessage\" : 997,\r\n      \"totalNonContiguousDeletedMessagesRange\" : 1,\r\n      \"properties\" : { }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"schemaLedgers\" : [ ],\r\n  \"compactedLedger\" : {\r\n    \"ledgerId\" : -1,\r\n    \"entries\" : -1,\r\n    \"size\" : -1,\r\n    \"offloaded\" : false,\r\n    \"underReplicated\" : false\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis problem occurred in the following situations:\r\n- There are two replication clusters, cluster-a and cluster-b\r\n- cluster-a usually has no producers or consumers, but once a day a producer connects and publishes messages\r\n- Only consumers are connected to cluster-b\r\n- Retention time is 0\r\n\r\nIn the above case, the producer for geo-replication on the cluster-a side will be closed after a certain period of time by GC.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/ca01447fb4df808f8e2da2dc75d44fad0b780032/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentTopic.java#L2626\r\n\r\nHowever, at this time, an already triggered operation to read new entries will not be cancelled. This operation will remain pending until new entries are available.\r\n\r\nThen 24 hours later the user's producer connects again and publishes messages. This triggers the pending operation and causes the replicator to start reading new entries.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the producer for geo-replication has not yet been restarted, these read entries will be dropped without being acknowledged.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/ca01447fb4df808f8e2da2dc75d44fad0b780032/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/GeoPersistentReplicator.java#L138-L149\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, since the user's producer is connected, the producer for geo-replication is also restarted and the cursor is rewound. After that, the state of the replicator is changed to `Started`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/ca01447fb4df808f8e2da2dc75d44fad0b780032/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/persistent/PersistentReplicator.java#L138-L145\r\n\r\nAt this time, one of the operations triggered before the cursor is rewound succeeds, causing `readPosition` to move to \"the position next to the successfully read entry\". Entries before this position will not be read again. As a result, entries that have been read once but not acknowledged will be left as an ack hole.\r\n\r\nIn short, a race condition between \"restarting a producer for georeplication\" and \"an read operation that was triggered the last time geo-replication occurred\" is what causes this issue.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nCancel the pending read request in the method `disableReplicatorRead` which is executed after the geo-replication producer is closed by GC.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

289: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20903\r\nRelates to: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20862\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation is to fix Pulsar Connector configurations that do not completely implement the `sensitive` annotation flag. Once implemented, users will be able to supply secrets in a secure, non-plaintext way. See the PIP for background and relevant details.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Update how `aerospike`, `canal`, `influxdb`, `jdbc/core`, `rabbitmq`, `redis`, and `solr` connectors load

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/20903\r\nRelates to: #20862 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation is to make it possible to configure Pulsar Connectors in a secure, non-plaintext way. See the PIP for background and relevant details. The new interpolation feature only applies when deploying with functions to Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Add `SecretsProvider#interpolateSecretForValue` method with a default that maintains the current behavior.\r\n* Override `interpolateSecretForValue` in the `EnvironmentBasedSecretsProvider` so that configuration values formatted as `${my-env-var}` will be replaced with the result of `System.getEnv(\"my-env-var\")` if the result is not `null`.\r\n* Implement a recursive string interpolation method that will replace any configuration value that the

the ledger is lower than the earliest retention time, mark it should be deleted\r\n  - if after deleting this ledger, the rest ledgers are still larger than the retention size, mark it should be deleted\r\n- delete the`{Ledgers to be deleted}`\r\n\r\nIn `step-3-2`, the implementation is like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nlong totalSizeToDelete = 0;\r\nfor (Ledger ledger : ledegrs) {\r\n    totalSizeToDelete += ledger.size;\r\n    if (calculateTotalSizeWrited() - totalSizeToDelete >= sizeShouldRetention ){\r\n       // mark the ledger should be deleted.\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nsee: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/branch-3.0/managed-ledger/src/main/java/org/apache/bookkeeper/mledger/impl/ManagedLedgerImpl.java#L2671-L2698\r\n\r\n**(Highlight)** There is a scenario that causes the task `trim ledgers` did  discontinuous ledger deletion, resulting consume messages discontinuous:\r\n- context: \r\n  - ledgers: `[{id=1, size=100}, {id=2,size=100}]`\r\n  - retention size: 150\r\n  - no cursor there\r\n- Check `ledger 1`, skip by retention check `(200 - 100) < 150`\r\n- One in-flight writing is finished, the `calculateTotalSizeWrited()` would return `300` now.\r\n- Check `ledger 2`, retention check `(300 - 100) > 150`, mark the ledger-2 should be deleted.\r\n- Delete the `ledger 2`.\r\n- Create a new consumer. It will receive messages from `[ledger-1, ledegr-3]`, but the `ledger-2` will be skipped.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nonce the retention constraint has been met, break the loop.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the replication scenario, we want to produce messages on the native cluster and consume messages on the remote cluster, the producer and consumer both use a same schema, but the consumer cannot be registered if there has no messages in the topic yet.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that for the remote cluster, there is a producer who has been registered with `AUTO_PRODUCE_BYTES` schema, so there is no schema to check the compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nIf there is no schema and only the replicator producer was registered, skip the compatibility check.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.
