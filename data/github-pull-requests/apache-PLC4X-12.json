href=\"https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/releases\">actions/dependency-review-action's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>3.0.0</h2>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>By default the action now expects <a href=\"https://spdx.org/licenses/\">SPDX-compliant licenses</a> everywhere. If you were previously using license names in the allow or deny lists make sure they're valid!</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<h3>Support for external configuration files</h3>\n<p>You can now specify a <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/#configuration-file\">configuration file external to your repository</a>. This allows organizations to have a single configuration file for all their repos.</p>\n<h3>Broader license support</h3>\n<p>We've added support for a much broader set of project licenses by using GitHub's <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/licenses\">Licenses API</a>.</p>\n<h3>SPDX Compliance</h3>\n<p>All of our license-related code now expects <a href=\"https://spdx.org/licenses/\">SPDX-compliant licenses or expressions</a>. This allows us to standardize on a license naming scheme that already supports <code>OR</code>/<code>AND</code> expressions.</p>\n<h3>Disable individual checks</h3>\n<p>You can now use the boolean options <code>license-check</code> and <code>vulnerability-check</code> to disable either one of the checks. More information in <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/#configuration-options\">our configuration options</a>.</p>\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\n<p>Contributors for this release include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cnagadya\"><code>@​cnagadya</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/courtneycl\"><code>@​courtneycl</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ericcornelissen\"><code>@​ericcornelissen</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/elireisman\"><code>@​elireisman</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hmaurer\"><code>@​hmaurer</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks everyone!\n<strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/compare/v2...v3.0.0\">https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/compare/v2...v3.0.0</a></p>\n<h2>2.5.1</h2>\n<p>Adding some quality-of-life improvements to the local development experience. You can now pass a flag to the <code>scripts/scan_pr</code> script using the <code>-c/--config-file</code> flags to use an external configuration file:</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre><code>  scripts/scan_pr https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/pull/294\n</code></pre>\n<h2>2.5.0</h2>\n<p>Fallback on GitHub Licenses API data for missing Dependency Review API Licenses. This should improve our license coverage.</p>\n<h2>2.4.1</h2>\n<p>This patch release fixes the bugs below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Display the dependency name instead of the manifest name in the detailed list of dependents.</li>\n<li>Fix an issue where undefined GHSAs would remove filter out all changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[golang.org/x/tools](https://github.com/golang/tools) from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/tools/releases\">golang.org/x/tools's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>gopls/v0.3.0</h2>\n<h4>Note: <code>gopls</code> now loads your entire workspace, where “workspace” is directory you opened in your editor.</h4>\n<h4>In module mode, you must open your module root (directory containing the <code>go.mod</code> file) or a subdirectory.</h4>\n<h4>In <code>GOPATH</code> mode, you must open your <code>GOPATH/src</code> or a directory within it. If you have a large <code>GOPATH</code> and you open your <code>GOPATH</code> as your workspace root, <code>gopls</code> may be very slow to load. Please see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/golang/tools/issues/36899\">#36899</a> for further information.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Autocompletion from unimported packages is on by default. You will get completions for something like <code>fmt.Printf</code> even if <code>“fmt”</code> isn’t imported yet. (<a href=\"https://github.com/heschik\"><code>@​heschik</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Workspace-scoped references, rename, and go to implementation. These features use your workspace root as the search scope, so behavior will vary based on the directory you open in your editor. This may result in unexpected behavior. (<a href=\"https://github.com/muirdm\"><code>@​muirdm</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/matloob\"><code>@​matloob</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Workspace-wide diagnostics. You will now see errors in your entire workspace, rather than just in your currently open files. Analysis errors will only be shown for packages with currently open files.</li>\n<li>Watch file changes on disk. This allows users to switch branches without reloading their editors. Also, changing configurations no longer requires an editor reload.</li>\n<li>GOPATH vendoring is fully supported. Previously, some features would ignore vendor directories, causing errors if packages weren't in GOPATH. (<a href=\"https://github.com/heschik\"><code>@​heschik</code></a>)</li>\n<li>New autocompletion suggestions for type conversions. Improved completions for literal candidates and variadic functions. Better rankings, including rankings for builtin functions and keywords. (<a href=\"https://github.com/muirdm\"><code>@​muirdm</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Highlighting improvements: Highlighting now applies not only to variables, but also to fields, methods, types, and imports. Additional highlighting helps visualize control flow in loops and functions. Highlighting of single character variables has better support. (<a href=\"https://github.com/ridersofrohan\"><code>@​ridersofrohan</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Documentation on hover includes links to <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev\">pkg.go.dev</a> for exported symbols. (<a href=\"https://github.com/Southclaws\"><code>@​Southclaws</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Improved support for cgo dependencies. All features now work for packages that have cgo dependencies. Authoring cgo packages is still not supported, but improvements are scheduled for Go 1.15 (see <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/golang/tools/issues/35721\">#35721</a>). (<a href=\"https://github.com/heschik\"><code>@​heschik</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Deep completions are now on by default. This feature of completion will search the fields and methods of all available candidates to see if there are any more candidates with the expected type. As an example, say you have imported the <code>context</code> package and are calling a function that takes a <code>context.Context</code> as a parameter. In the case that you don’t have a variable of that type in scope, deep completions will suggest <code>context.Background()</code> and <code>context.TODO()</code>. (<a href=\"https://github.com/muirdm\"><code>@​muirdm</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Opt-in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>staticcheck analyses remain opt-in and can be enabled by setting <code>&quot;staticcheck&quot;: true</code> in your <code>gopls</code> settings.</li>\n<li>Go 1.14 will support running the go command without modifying the user’s <code>go.mod</code> file. This new feature is used in <code>gopls</code> to show diagnostics and suggest edits in a user’s <code>go.mod</code> file rather than change the file without the user noticing. Currently, <code>gopls</code> will suggest removing unused dependencies and warn the user if there is a parse error in the <code>go.mod</code> file. Enable this behavior by using the go1.14 beta and setting <code>&quot;tempModfile&quot;: true</code> in your <code>gopls</code> settings.

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/210\">#210</a> Improve error messages when Groovy classes can't be located (avoiding the <code>NullPointerException</code>s that

caused an exception to be thrown for Groovy 4.0.0-RC-1 and newer when binding properties in a script/console/shell and <code>bindPropertiesToSeparateVariables</code> is false. The error logging when this happens has been improved.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/groovy/GMavenPlus/issues/223\">#223</a> Support <code>5</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>8</code>, and <code>1.9</code> arguments to <code>targetBytecode</code> so that validation doesn't unexpectedly fail since it uses the <code>maven.compiler.target</code> property and these arguments are valid for javac.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Potentially breaking changes</h2>\n<p>This release requires Java 8 and drops support for Java 7.
