new architecture consists of two primary layers: the Data Quality Layer and the Integration Layer.\r\n\r\n### Data Quality Layer\r\n\r\nThis layer abstracts the core concepts of the data quality lifecycle, focusing on:\r\n\r\n- **Defining Specific Data Quality**:\r\n  - **Metrics**: Establishing specific data quality metrics.\r\n  - **Anomaly Detection**: Implementing methods for detecting anomalies.\r\n  - **Actions**: Defining actions to be taken based on the data quality assessments.\r\n\r\n- **Measuring Data Quality**:\r\n  - Utilizing various connectors such as SQL, HTTP, and CMD to measure data quality across different systems.\r\n\r\n- **Unifying Data Quality Results**:\r\n  - Creating a standardized view of data quality results across different dimensions to ensure a consistent understanding.\r\n\r\n- **Flexible Data Quality Jobs**:\r\n  - Designing data quality jobs within a generic, topological Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) framework to facilitate easy plug-and-play functionality.\r\n\r\n### Integration Layer\r\n\r\nThis layer provides a robust framework to enable users to integrate Griffin data quality pipelines seamlessly with their business processes. It includes:\r\n\r\n- **Scheduler Integration**:\r\n  - Ensuring seamless integration with typical schedulers for efficient pipeline execution.\r\n\r\n- **Apache DolphinScheduler Integration**:\r\n  - Facilitating effortless integration within the Java ecosystem to leverage Apache DolphinScheduler.\r\n\r\n- **Apache Airflow Integration**:\r\n  - Enabling smooth integration within the AI ecosystem using Apache Airflow.\r\n\r\nThis architecture aims to provide a comprehensive and flexible approach to managing data quality and integrating it into various business workflows.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-23T02:04:28Z","updated_at":"2024-07-03T09:15:13Z","closed_at":"2024-07-03T09:15:13Z","merged_at":"2024-07-03T09:15:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"e293406f5756a9d375a1e123f32dbbdd72934130","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/pulls/654/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/pulls/654/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/issues/654/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/griffin/statuses/a3c89995e2c2e31b6889782ffcf34e7aa55ba635","head":{"label":"guoyuepeng:griffin_1.0.0_arch","ref":"griffin_1.0.0_arch","sha":"a3c89995e2c2e31b6889782ffcf34e7aa55ba635","user":{"login":"guoyuepeng","id":20692611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjkyNjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20692611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng","html_url":"https://github.com/guoyuepeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":767955352,"node_id":"R_kgDOLcYRmA","name":"griffin","full_name":"guoyuepeng/griffin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guoyuepeng","id":20692611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjkyNjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20692611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng","html_url":"https://github.com/guoyuepeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyuepeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guoyuepeng/griffin","description":"Mirror

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v2.32.0</h2>\n<h2>2.32.0 (2024-05-20)</h2>\n<h2>🐍 PYCON US 2024 EDITION 🐍</h2>\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where setting <code>verify=False</code> on the first request from a\nSession will cause subsequent requests to the <em>same origin</em> to also ignore\ncert verification, regardless of the value of <code>verify</code>.\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56\">https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>verify=True</code> now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve\nrequest time variance between first and subsequent requests. It should\nalso minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python\nversion built with OpenSSL 3.x. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6667\">#6667</a>)</li>\n<li>Requests now supports optional use of character detection\n(<code>chardet</code> or <code>charset_normalizer</code>) when repackaged or vendored.\nThis enables <code>pip</code> and other projects to minimize their vendoring\nsurface area. The <code>Response.text()</code> and <code>apparent_encoding</code> APIs\nwill default to <code>utf-8</code> if neither library is present. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6702\">#6702</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly\ncalculated in the request content-length.

It should\nalso minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python\nversion built with OpenSSL 3.x. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6667\">#6667</a>)</li>\n<li>Requests now supports optional use of character detection\n(<code>chardet</code> or <code>charset_normalizer</code>) when repackaged or vendored.\nThis enables <code>pip</code> and other projects to minimize their vendoring\nsurface area. The <code>Response.text()</code> and <code>apparent_encoding</code> APIs\nwill default to <code>utf-8</code> if neither library is present. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/psf/requests/issues/6702\">#6702</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly\ncalculated in the request content-length.

wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.1.\n* Fixed an issue that prevented the use of Python buffer protocol objects in\n  ``sign`` and ``verify`` methods on asymmetric keys.\n* Fixed an issue with incorrect keyword-argument naming with ``EllipticCurvePrivateKey``\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey.exchange`,\n  ``X25519PrivateKey``\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x25519.X25519PrivateKey.exchange`,\n  ``X448PrivateKey``\n  :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x448.X448PrivateKey.exchange`,\n  and

incorrect keyword-argument naming with <code>EllipticCurvePrivateKey</code>\n:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey.sign</code>.</li>\n<li>Resolved compatibility issue with loading certain RSA public keys in\n:func:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.load_pem_public_key</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.. _v42-0-0:</p>\n<p>42.0.0 - 2024-01-22</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.7.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Loading a PKCS7 with no content field using\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  or\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  will now raise a ``ValueError`` rather than return an empty list.\n* Parsing SSH certificates no longer permits malformed critical options with\n  values, as documented in the 41.0.2 release notes.\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.0.\n* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.63.0, from 1.56.0.\n* We now publish both ``py37`` and ``py39`` ``abi3`` wheels. This should\n  resolve some errors relating to initializing a module multiple times per\n  process.\n* Support :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS` for\n  X.509 certificate signing requests and certificate revocation lists with the\n  keyword-only argument ``rsa_padding`` on the ``sign`` methods for\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequestBuilder` and\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationListBuilder`.\n* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate signing request signature\n  algorithm parameters (including PSS) via\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst\">cryptography's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>42.0.0 - 2024-01-22</p>\n<pre><code>\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.7.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Loading a PKCS7 with no content field using\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_pem_pkcs7_certificates`\n  or\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.load_der_pkcs7_certificates`\n  will now raise a ``ValueError`` rather than return an empty list.\n* Parsing SSH certificates no longer permits malformed critical options with\n  values, as documented in the 41.0.2 release notes.\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.2.0.\n* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.63.0, from 1.56.0.\n* We now publish both ``py37`` and ``py39`` ``abi3`` wheels. This should\n  resolve some errors relating to initializing a module multiple times per\n  process.\n* Support :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS` for\n  X.509 certificate signing requests and certificate revocation lists with the\n  keyword-only argument ``rsa_padding`` on the ``sign`` methods for\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequestBuilder` and\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationListBuilder`.\n* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate signing request signature\n  algorithm parameters (including PSS) via\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest.signature_algorithm_parameters`.\n* Added support for obtaining X.509 certificate revocation list signature\n  algorithm parameters (including PSS) via\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.signature_algorithm_parameters`.\n* Added ``mgf`` property to\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.PSS`.\n* Added ``algorithm`` and ``mgf`` properties to\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.padding.OAEP`.\n* Added the following properties that return timezone-aware ``datetime`` objects:\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_before_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_after_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.RevokedCertificate.revocation_date_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.next_update_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.last_update_utc`.\n  These are timezone-aware variants of existing properties that return naïve\n  ``datetime`` objects.\n* Deprecated the following properties that return naïve ``datetime`` objects:\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_before`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.not_valid_after`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.RevokedCertificate.revocation_date`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.next_update`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateRevocationList.last_update`\n  in favor of the new timezone-aware variants mentioned above.\n* Added support for\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.ChaCha20`\n  on LibreSSL.\n* Added support for RSA PSS signatures in PKCS7 with\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

where ``Cipher.update_into`` accepted Python\n  buffer protocol objects, but allowed immutable buffers. **CVE-2023-23931**\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.0.8.\n<p>.. _v39-0-0:</p>\n<p>39.0.0 - 2023-01-01\n</code></pre></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Support for OpenSSL 1.1.0 has been removed.\nUsers on older version of OpenSSL will need to upgrade.</li>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.5. The new\nminimum LibreSSL version is 3.5.0. Going forward our policy is to support\nversions of LibreSSL that are available in versions of OpenBSD that are\nstill receiving security support.</li>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Removed the <code>encode_point</code> and\n<code>from_encoded_point</code> methods on\n:class:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicNumbers</code>,\nwhich had been deprecated for several years.\n:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.public_bytes</code>\nand\n:meth:<code>~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.EllipticCurvePublicKey.from_encoded_point</code>\nshould be used instead.</li>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Support for using MD5 or SHA1 in\n:class:<code>~cryptography.x509.CertificateBuilder</code>, other X.509 builders, and\nPKCS7 has been removed.</li>\n<li><strong>BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:</strong> Dropped support for macOS 10.10 and 10.11, macOS\nusers must upgrade to 10.12 or newer.</li>\n<li><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT:</strong> The next version of <code>cryptography</code> (40.0) will change\nthe way we link OpenSSL. This will only impact users who build\n<code>cryptography</code> from source (i.e., not from a <code>wheel</code>), and specify their\nown version of OpenSSL. For those users, the <code>CFLAGS</code>, <code>LDFLAGS</code>,\n<code>INCLUDE</code>, <code>LIB</code>, and <code>CRYPTOGRAPHY_SUPPRESS_LINK_FLAGS</code> environment\nvariables will no longer be respected.

changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent `RuleParams` can be of the following 3 DSL types,\r\n\r\n- Data Ops (for source preprocessing)\r\n- Griffin DSL\r\n- SparkSQL\r\n\r\nGriffinDSL allows the implementation of measures (DQ Types) like Completeness, Accuracy, etc.\r\n\r\nTo enable such measures there is an extensive implementation of expression, task hierarchies, parsing and most of this is heavily dependent on scala-parser-combinators.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the implementation, Griffin DSL tries to mimic a SparkSQL-like query but substitution of user-defined constraints.\r\n\r\nThis approach has some drawbacks,\r\n\r\n- Suboptimal processing. While the transformation steps execute in parallel on the driver, the data set is still scanned multiple times in parallel which can cause inefficiencies on the SparkSession side and the internal task scheduler was single-threaded. Even though the data set can be cached, still it branched and crucial memory is required for holding the dataset rather than processing it.\r\n- Internal functions of Spark are not used. Data preprocessing has a very limited scope currently even though we have 100s spark SQL functions available for use.\r\n- This blocks structured streaming. The manually constructed SQL queries cause multiple aggregations in the same query on a streaming data set which is not supported by Spark's Structured streaming. There are workarounds for this but they all require rewriting the *Expr2DQSteps classes.\r\n- Griffin DSL is SparkSQL like but not 100% compatible. Profiling measure and SparkSQL are redundant functionalities\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution involves SparkSQL DSL based measures and some changes to Rule Params. This will enhance the data pre proc flows and the measures themselves\r\n\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?**\r\nYes. Users can use the new measures as a separate configuration and there is scope for more data pre-processing.\r\n\r\n**How was this patch tested?**\r\nUnit
