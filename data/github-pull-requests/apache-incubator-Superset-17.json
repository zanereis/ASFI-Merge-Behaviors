Support</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v15.1.2</h2>\n<p>The utility packages <code>@react-dnd/invariant</code>, <code>@react-dnd/shallowequal</code>, and <code>@react-dnd/asap</code> (which are forks of popular libraries) have been included in the monorepo and built using the same output mechanisms as the <code>react-dnd</code> core packages (dual EJS/CSM).</p>\n<p><code>@react-dnd/asap</code> has been simplified to remove the node variant, which relied on deprecated APIs</p>\n<h2>v15.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>All packages now have verified ESM support</li>\n<li>Packages expose CJS/ESM surface are via <code>pkg.exports</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v15.0.2</h2>\n<p>This release uses output from swc using the 'es2017' target instead of using output from 'tsc' using the 'ESNext' target.</p>\n<h2>v15.0.1</h2>\n<p>This release fixes issues with the ESM-only structure of v15.0.0. All packages are now in their prior CommonJS/ESM format.</p>\n<h2>v15.0.0</h2>\n<h2>Major Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><del>The react-dnd packages are now published as ESM-only with <code>type: module</code>. See this FAQ by sindresorhus: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c\">https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c</a></del></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Decorators API has been removed and fully replaced by the Hooks API. The Decorators API was difficult to develop &amp; type correctly, and this improves its maintainability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The builds no longer use babel &amp; preset-env. The library is transpiled using SWC into the &quot;es2017&quot; target, which assumes async/await is available. This should reduce bundle sizes by removing polyfills and support-code which may be unnecessary in your target.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve data-transfer acquisition from File inputs (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3262\">#3262</a>)</li>\n<li>Don't set the 'draggable' attribute unless <code>canDrag</code> is true (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3187\">#3187</a>)</li>\n<li>Improve typings of DropTargetMonitor, DragLayerMonitor (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3300\">#3300</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3341\">#3341</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v14.0.3</h2>\n<h2>Updated</h2>\n<p>react-dnd: 14.0.3\nreact-dnd-html5-backend: 14.0.1\nreact-dnd-touch-backend: 14.1.0</p>\n<h2>Patch Updates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix drop operations in iframes &amp; child windows (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3181\">#3181</a>) (thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/eramdam\"><code>@‚Äãeramdam</code></a>!)</li>\n<li>Refactor TouchBackend OptionsReader (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3291\">#3291</a>)</li>\n<li>Cleanup connected DOM elements from react-dnd internals when hook-based components unmount (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3290\">#3290</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix issue where custom drag-sources where triggering native drops in Firefox (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/issues/3272\">#3272</a>) (thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/istateside\"><code>@‚Äãistateside</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v14.0.2</h2>\n<h3>Patch</h3>\n<p>This PR will throw a developer exception if a user specifies a <code>useDrag::spec.begin</code> method.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFixing changes from https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28783 where we needed to update the slack sdk call to the new files_upload_v2 method. The api changes a few things that were missed in the original PR: the `channels` arg is now the channel id instead of name. Also it is recommended to use `channel` instead of `channels`. I also found that the slack util file wasn't being used and cleaned up a few other affected parts. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing up #24539\r\nThis commit modifies the `addQueryEditor` function to asynchronously handle the process of creating a queryEditor in localStorage in the same way as in non-persistent mode and periodically saving the queryEditor state to persistence via AutoSync's `migrateQueryEditorFromLocalStorage`. \r\n\r\nThis commit made the following changes:\r\n- Migrate migrateQueryEditorFromLocalStorage from the App's componentDidMount to EditorAutoSync.\r\n- EditorAutoSync will execute migrateQueryEditorFromLocalStorage periodically.\r\n- MIGRATE_QUERY_EDITOR will replace the old queryEditor at the same location instead of pushing it to the end.\r\n- Remove the logic of syncing localStorage tabHistory since it is already handled in the middleware.\r\n\r\nIn persistence mode, new tabs can now open and access data directly from localStorage without the delays caused by network or database latency.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

using docker-compose, we mount the local drive and fire up a `npm run dev` which is effectively webpack in --watch mode, so that it looks for changes in frontend files and compiles-as-you-change interactively.\r\n\r\n`npm run build` is in the Dockerfile, specifically in the superset-node layer which is used to compile and later COPY the static assets into a python-based layer, `lean`.\r\n\r\nBut in the context of docker-compose, we don't need all of it, and that `npm run build` has gotten expensive in terms of memory usage and takes a while to build. In recent build memory monitoring I've seen the docker container peak at like 13GB memory during this phase.\r\n\r\nSo in this PR I'm:\r\n- making `npm run build` optional with a dockerfile ARG (default is current behavior, but docker-compose skips it)\r\n- adding a `superset-node-base` layer for that superset-node service in docker-compose that runs `npm run dev`, ensuring the same base for both processes, but stopping/diverging prior to `npm ci`\r\n- making `npm install` run only if node_module is not present in the superset-node service. The user can simply `npm i` locally if/when they alter package.json. That speeds up firing up `docker-compose up` as unless you nuke node_modules/ it'll skip that

controlling who can certify datasets. We have a central analytics engineering team who are the single-source of truth regarding datasets. We would like them to be the only team that can certify their datasets.\r\n\r\nThis introduces the ability to create a new type of role ('certifier') that we can grant to members of that team. There is an additional feature flag that would enable this feature. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, we support several static label types:\r\n- key\r\n- value\r\n- percent\r\n- key_value\r\n- key_percent\r\n- key_value_percent\r\n- value_percent\r\n\r\nProviding a dynamic way for users to customize labels could be a great and innovative feature, making our pie charts more useful.\r\n\r\nWe have introduced a new label type called `template` to support this feature. Users can customize the label by writing a string template. The string template supports the following variables:\r\n- `{name}` the name of a data item\r\n- `{value}` the value of a data item, formatted with number format option\r\n- `{percent}` the percentage of a data item, formatted with  number formatter\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for ECharts compatibility, the following variables are supported:\r\n- `{a}` series name.\r\n- `{b}` the name of a data item, unformatted\r\n- `{c}` the value of a data item, unformatted\r\n- `{d}` percentage, unformatted\r\n\r\n`\\n` is supported to represent a new line.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nFormatted variables:\r\n<img width=\"740\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/157834442/5e58b76e-4fc7-4f7e-a108-0a666027bdf2\">\r\n\r\n\r\nECharts compatible variables:\r\n<img width=\"751\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/157834442/e5b432f7-3360-4ff0-bc0c-644d871566ad\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

a few tricks to make docker-compose use less memory:\r\n\r\n- not starting the `superset-tests-worker` service on a normal `docker-compose up` by using `profile`. From my understanding this service is used only by `scripts/tests/run.sh`, and it starts/stops it on its own - doesn't assume its already running. This saves ~900MB, while maintaining 8 workers to run tests by default, but makes it confiurable if you wanted more you could more easily change it now\r\n- starting only 2 workers by default for `superset-worker` as opposed to the default of 8, which is not necessary for dev workflows. This saves maybe ~500MB\r\n\r\n### before\r\n<img width=\"1326\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-29 at 4 16 17‚ÄØPM\"

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis is meant to fix a bug that would prevent the deletion of filters from `Query B` in the control panel of a mixed chart.\r\nThe condition to run the `canDelete` function for a filter previously only allowed for `adhoc_filters` as a valid value but the mixed chart uses `adhoc_filters_b` for the `Query B` group. This change should allow any string starting with `adhoc_filters` to be checked for deletion conditions.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nB:\r\n![filters_old-ezgif com-optimize](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/92495987/cfa9c76e-e516-4e5b-bd9a-f365ebf65cce)\r\nA:\r\n![filters_new-ezgif com-optimize](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/92495987/8472c0eb-64a3-4a01-a2e3-c9da0a204ea6)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new feature flag, `IMPERSONATE_WITH_EMAIL_PREFIX`. When the flag is on (default is off) the user impersonation functionality will use the email prefix as the username, instead of the actual username.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for deployments using OAuth2 for login, where the username might be something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT username, email FROM ab_user;\r\ngoogle-oauth2|633391720998176487074, beto@example.org\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the feature flag on the impersonation would use `beto` as the username passed to the database.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR allows Helm deployments to use custom HPA solutions. \r\n\r\nIn my company, we don't use the Kubernetes metrics server for autoscaling, but rather [Keda](https://keda.sh/) with Prometheus metrics. With that in mind, the current Helm deployment doesn't work for us, as the default HPA solution cannot find the metrics to autoscale. \r\n\r\nThe idea is to allow developers to specify custom HPA in their Kubernetes. To do so, it would be great if we could control the `replicaCount` of Worker and Node deployments, so that we can turn off the replicaCount and provide an HPA solution outside the Helm Charts.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Creates `.Values.supersetNode.replicas.enabled` bool with `true` as default value. \r\n- Creates `.Values.supersetWorker.replicas.enabled` bool with `true` as default value.\r\n- Moves `.Values.supersetNode.replicaCount` to `.Values.supersetNode.replicas.replicaCount`\r\n- Moves `.Values.supersetWorker.replicaCount` to `.Values.supersetNode.replicas.replicaCount`\r\n- Updates the charts of Node and Worker\r\n  - `if not [worker|node].autoscaling.enabled and [worker|node].replicas.enabled` then the replicaCount logic will be applied. Any other combination will remove replicaCount. \r\n  - By default values the replicaCount logic will be applied as `autoscaling` is disabled and `replicas` is enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/47871, in Python 3.10+ (which is now the minimal supported Python version in Superset) there's a Pandas bug where `DataFrame.to_csv` unnecessarily requires one to specify an `escapechar` even though‚Äîper [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/6575cacc5d1cc59c7cacd9e186a1d05e76259183/superset/utils/csv.py#L42-L64)‚Äîspecial values have already been escaped.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nUpdated unit tests.\r\n\r\nAlso tested locally, i.e., I was able to successfully export a CSV file containing escaped special characters in Python 3.9 yet it throws in Python 3.10 with the following error, \r\n\r\n```\r\n_csv.Error: need to escape, but no escapechar set\r\n```\r\n\r\nunless an escape character is specified.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, a request for a new dashboard (hitting /dashboard/new) will respond with a 308 permanent redirect because the UI hits `/dashboard/new` even though the backend exposes `/dashboard/new/` https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/6575cacc5d1cc59c7cacd9e186a1d05e76259183/superset/views/dashboard/views.py#L117\r\nFlask handles this case by responding with a 308 to the exposed version https://flask-cn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/#flask.Flask.route. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes routes in the frontend from `/dashboard/new` to `/dashboard/new/` so that requests can be made without a 308 redirect.\r\n\r\nIn our infrastructure setup, there's a problem with the 308 redirect and it points to an invalid address. I believe others have seen this problem as well in this issue https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20577. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nReproduction Steps\r\n1. Hard refresh to remove cached response to `/dashboard/new` redirection\r\n2. Create a new dashboard\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n<img width=\"1507\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 9 05 32‚ÄØPM\"

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, the order of the db selector dropdown in SQL Lab is always sorted by record ID, regardless of the intended sort order.\r\nThis issue arises due to two reasons: \r\n1. an incorrect order_column name is being passed\r\n2. AsyncSelect component's [default sortComparator](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/07b2449bd777cf04a266f1de3d72af6874b9c305/superset-frontend/src/components/Select/AsyncSelect.tsx#L138) is sorting by ID (Since label is not a string, the next ordering will be by id).\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes these issues, ensuring that the db selector is sorted by the API order as intended.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nIn the process of taking screenshots for an alert/report, Selenium/Playwright is configured to wait a certain time (controlled via `superset_config.py`) until all chart elements are drawn. The logic was configured to monitor the `slice_container` class, however with https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27255 this class is only used once the chart data is retrieved.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the class to be monitored to the `chart-container` wrapper.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Configure `SCREENSHOT_LOCATE_WAIT` to be 30 seconds, and `SCREENSHOT_LOAD_WAIT` to be 200 seconds.\r\n2. Create a chart that takes longer than 30 seconds to load. You can use `pg_sleep()` with Postgres for example. \r\n3. Configure a report with this chart. \r\n\r\nBefore this PR the report would fail, as the chart wouldn't load within 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWe identified an issue where FileSystemCache is used, setting values for `table_cache_timeout` and `schema_cache_timeout` in the database properties modal leads to failures in fetching schema and table lists in SQLLab. The requests to `/api/v1/database/{dbId}/tables/?q=(force:!f,schema_name:{schemaName})` were returning a 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY status.\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue was that `table_cache_timeout` and `schema_cache_timeout` values were being serialized as strings instead of numbers. The backend expected numeric values, resulting in the 422 error when it encountered strings. To resolve this, we need to ensure that these values are correctly converted to numbers before they are sent in the payload.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/8809047/86dd8c56-0015-4450-ad51-bb49e7f85f2b\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/8809047/88c1f072-1637-47d6-9510-52a4b85556dd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

#28705\r\n\r\nWe found our chart cache warm-up task (as in [the example in the Kubernetes

(`Superset.warm_up_caches`) exists but is a GET request\r\n- That endpoint is deprecated by `/api/v1/chart/warm_up_caches` (`ChartRestApi.warm_up_cache`) (scheduled for deletion in 4.0 but I couldn't find discussions around that)\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the task to call the newer endpoint (accidentally reverted in 56069b05f9cf4d0c725d1b4b0ad6038b50837cd4).\r\n\r\nI also ran into CSRF issues (similar to discussion in #27160), so added a method to fetch this (thanks to Will Gan on slack for the hint). Perhaps this can be placed more centrally? This appears to work on installations with CSRF disabled (I've tested with `WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = False`).\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
