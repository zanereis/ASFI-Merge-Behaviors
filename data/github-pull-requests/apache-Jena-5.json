(858caf425c)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made our <code>Collector</code> APIs (e.g., <code>ImmutableList.toImmutableList()</code>) available in <code>guava-android</code>. More <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6567\">Java 8 APIs</a> will follow in future releases.

(But note that we test only with library desugaring, so we don't <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/7197\">currently</a> know if API Level 24 is high enough to use our <code>Collector</code> APIs unless you have also enabled library desugaring.) Guava users who <em>avoid</em> the <code>Collector</code> APIs do <em>not</em> need to meet this requirement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Fixed a potential <code>NullPointerException</code> in <code>ImmutableMap.Builder</code> on a rare code path. (70a98115d8)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constants <code>Ad-Auction-Allowed</code>, <code>Permissions-Policy-Report-Only</code>, and <code>Sec-GPC</code>.

issue resolved #2344\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nLooked at the links provided by @kinow in https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/2344#issuecomment-2021290428 and tried to change `'` with `\\\"`.\r\n\r\nThis gave a new error which looks like `crossenv` doesn't support `:=` on windows, in `${FUSEKI_PORT:=3030}` (and PORT).\r\nLooked at crossenv on github and I think it is not available.\r\n\r\n I looked at maybe changing the shell to run from in windows, by adding a .npmrc file, but then I got license (RAT) errors when running the CI, and instead of adding it to exclude list, I asked GPT figured the operator is *probably* not available in powershell. I ended up using the ENV vars only since `FUSEKI_PORT` is already used without fallback values in other locations of the package.json file.\r\n\r\nGlanced at  the final e2e output in https://github.com/OyvindLGjesdal/jena/actions/runs/8623049304 and it looks good to my untrained eyes.\r\n\r\nHave left to check if it breaks anything for Linux and Mac, and will create a single commit.\r\n\r\nOutput when only fixing the apos -> escaped quote:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] $ cross-env FUSEKI_PORT=\"${FUSEKI_PORT:=3030}\" PORT=\"${PORT:=8080}\" concurrently --names 'SERVER,CLIENT,TESTS'

in $dayjob work that `RDFPatchReaderBinary` would silently accept malformed inputs in some cases.  Started by adding several test cases, some of which failed, to demonstrate that the RDF Patch Binary reader can silently accept invalid streams.  Then debugged from there are introduced additional logic which makes a best effort attempt to distinguish between genuine EOF and EOF due to malformed input that should produce an error.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Thrift API doesn't have a clean way to detect that you've genuinely reached the EOF so we just have to attempt to read the next row from the patch, and detect the obvious cases of malformed input:\r\n\r\n1. `TProtocolUtil.skip()` getting called, this indicates that Thrift recognised a Field ID but that the Type ID was not the expected type for that field.  So if we hit a EOF while skipping over such a field we're definitely reading malformed input.\r\n2. `TUnion.read()` getting called multiple times.  This means that we're partway through reading an otherwise valid data structure at the point where we encounter the EOF so again is a clear indicator of malformed input.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this solution is somewhat hacky, if anyone has a more robust solution please feel free to suggest it\r\n\r\nGitHub issue resolved #2402\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Documentation

`RDFParser.toDatasetGraph()` creates a fresh transactional `DatasetGraph` and then proceeds to using it without transactions meaning every triple/quad output is a separate auto-committed write transaction. This behaviour is changed to place the entire parsing process inside a write transaction to boost performance.\r\n\r\nGitHub issue resolved #2400\r\n\r\nThis is a combination of proposed solution 2 and 3 from #2400. The code is changed to use the freshly minted `Dataset` or `DatasetGraph` inside of a transaction and the corresponding Javadoc on the `toDataset()` and `toDatasetGraph()` methods note that supplying your desired implementation of those interfaces to the relevant `parse()` method may be preferable.\r\n\r\nWith this chance performance across the test cases is improved:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot

object, which contains various\n<code>Deprecation</code> objects that define the different types of deprecation used by\nthe Sass compiler and can be passed to the options below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add a new <code>fatalDeprecations</code> compiler option that causes the compiler to\nerror if any deprecation warnings of the provided types are encountered. You\ncan also pass in a <code>Version</code> object to treat all deprecations that were active\nin that Dart Sass version as fatal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add a new <code>futureDeprecations</code> compiler option that allows you to opt-in to\ncertain deprecations early (currently just <code>import</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add a new <code>silenceDeprecations</code> compiler option to ignore any deprecation\nwarnings of the provided types.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Command-Line Interface</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Add a new <code>--silence-deprecation</code> flag, which causes the compiler to ignore\nany deprecation warnings of the provided types.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Previously, if a future deprecation was passed to <code>--fatal-deprecation</code> but\nnot <code>--future-deprecation</code>, it would be treated as fatal despite not being\nenabled. Both flags are now required to treat a future deprecation as fatal\nwith a warning emitted if <code>--fatal-deprecation</code> is passed without\n<code>--future-deprecation</code>, matching the JS API's behavior.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dart API</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>compile</code> methods now take in a <code>silenceDeprecations</code> parameter, which\ncauses the compiler to ignore any deprecation warnings of the provided types.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add <code>Deprecation.obsoleteIn</code> to match the JS API. This is currently null for\nall deprecations, but will be used once some deprecations become obsolete in\nDart Sass 2.0.0.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Potentially breaking bug fix:</strong> Fix a bug where <code>compileStringToResultAsync</code>\nignored <code>fatalDeprecations</code> and <code>futureDeprecations</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The behavior around making future deprecations fatal mentioned in the CLI\nsection above has also been changed in the Dart API.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.73.0</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

issue resolved #2370\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\n@afs, @jmkeil, first stab at #2370. Had a look at [^1] and [^2], and I saw some parts of the text mentioning \"percent-encoded\" in requests, and that the backend is supposed to return 400, as it's doing now. From quickly reading those two (skipping parts, trying to find info for validation), I think\r\n\r\n1. empty is valid\r\n2. spaces are no-no\r\n3. otherwise it must be a URI\r\n4. encoded URL is no-no, it must be a valid URI, without encoded parts\r\n\r\nI extended the current validation to also check 3 and 4 now. Does that sound right?\r\n\r\nThis is a draft until I confirm that the fix looks good, then I will either write the tests, or modify the PR again to move the code to some JS module as that a lot easier to write unit-test against, instead of testing code buried somewhere in Vue code/components.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ] Documentation change and

clearing up.\r\n\r\nThe biggest change is to undo the chaining style of the `AWriter` abstraction (a simplifer writer-like interface) and also used in settter for `IndentedWriter`.\r\n\r\nThe chaining was to allow setters like `setLineNumbers` and output functions `print` to chain:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   AWriter out = IndentedWriter.stdout.clone().setLineNumbers(true);\r\n   out.println(\"foo\").println(\"bar\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this causes a lot of IDE warnings. The result of a chain-able method is `this` but the IDE does not know that fact. \r\nIt looks to the IDE like a fresh AutoClosable resource and it suggests try-with-resource. Only the outer resource needs that.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this is a primarily internal class, the chaining was added recently at 5.0.0, and chaining has not been retro-applied much in the code base.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I acknowledge that I am making a contribution to the Apache Software Foundation under the terms and conditions of the [Contributor's

href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases\">com.google.guava:guava's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>33.1.0</h2>\n<h3>Request for Android users</h3>\n<p>If you know of Guava Android users who have not yet upgraded to at least the previous release <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v33.0.0\">33.0.0</a>, please encourage them to do so. Starting with that version, we are experimenting with including Java 8+ APIs in <code>guava-android</code>. Before we commit to adding such APIs, we want as much testing as we can get: If we later expose a set of Java 8+ APIs and then discover that they break users, we won't want to remove them, as the removal would break users, too.</p>\n<h3>Maven</h3>\n<pre lang=\"xml\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;!-- or, for Android: --&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;33.1.0-android&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Jar files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-jre/guava-33.1.0-jre.jar\">33.1.0-jre.jar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/guava/33.1.0-android/guava-33.1.0-android.jar\">33.1.0-android.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guava requires <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UseGuavaInYourBuild#what-about-guavas-own-dependencies\">one runtime dependency</a>, which you can download here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/guava/failureaccess/1.0.1/failureaccess-1.0.1.jar\">failureaccess-1.0.1.jar</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Javadoc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/docs/\">33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/docs/\">33.1.0-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JDiff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-jre/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-jre vs. 33.0.0-jre</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/diffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.0.0-android</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guava.dev/releases/33.1.0-android/api/androiddiffs/\">33.1.0-android vs. 33.1.0-jre</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changelog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated our Error Prone dependency to 2.26.1, which includes a JPMS-ready jar of annotations. If you use the Error Prone annotations in a modular build of your own code, you may need to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1\">add a <code>requires</code> line for them</a>. (d48c6dfbb8, c6e91c498ced26631029d1bdfdb9154d4a217368)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Added a <code>Duration</code> overload for <code>Suppliers.memoizeWithExpiration</code>. (76e46ec35b)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Deprecated the remaining two overloads of <code>Throwables.propagateIfPossible</code>. They won't be deleted, but we recommend migrating off them. (cf86414a87)</li>\n<li><code>cache</code>: Fixed a bug that could cause <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/pull/6851#issuecomment-1931276822\">false &quot;recursive load&quot; reports during refresh</a>. (0e1aebf73e)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the return types of <code>transitiveClosure()</code> and <code>reachableNodes()</code> to <code>Immutable*</code> types. <code>reachableNodes()</code> already returned an immutable object (even though that was not reflected in the declared return type); <code>transitiveClosure()</code> used to return a mutable object. The old signatures remain available, so this change does not break binary compatibility. (09e655f6c1)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Changed the behavior of views returned by graph accessor methods that take a graph element as input: They now throw <code>IllegalStateException</code> when that element is removed from the graph. (8dca776341)</li>\n<li><code>hash</code>: Optimized <code>Checksum</code>-based hash functions for Java 9+. (afb35a5d1b)</li>\n<li><code>testing</code>: Exposed <code>FakeTicker</code> <code>Duration</code> methods to Android users. (f346bbb6a7)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Deprecated the constructors of <code>UncheckedExecutionException</code> and <code>ExecutionError</code> that don't accept a cause. We won't remove these constructors, but we recommend migrating off them, as users of those classes often assume that instances will contain a cause. (1bb3c4386b)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Improved the correctness of racy accesses for J2ObjC users.

Kotlin extension. This allows you to do e.g.:</p>\n<p>await.forever until { .. }</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added shortcut for enabling logging. Before you had to do e.g.</p>\n<p>await()\n.with()\n.conditionEvaluationListener(new ConditionEvaluationLogger(log::info))\n.pollInterval(ONE_HUNDRED_MILLISECONDS)\n.until(logs::size, is(4));</p>\n<p>You can now instead use the &quot;logging&quot; shortcut:</p>\n<p>await()\n.with()\n.logging(log::info)\n.pollInterval(ONE_HUNDRED_MILLISECONDS)\n.until(logs::size, is(4));</p>\n<p>or simply &quot;.logging()&quot; for &quot;System.out&quot;.</p>\n<p>This shortcut has also been added globally:</p>\n<p>Awaitility.setLogging(log::info);</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>Awaitility.setDefaultLogging();</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved lambda detection for Java 17 and Java

the usage of the `ExpiringMap` API with Jena's existing `Cache` abstraction API (backed by Caffeine `Cache`), this entails some related changes to the configuration portions of the GeoSPARQL

This now requires replacing the existing index with a new one.\r\n\r\nGitHub issue resolved #2330\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ] Documentation change and updates are provided

issue resolved #2315\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\nAn attempt to address the problem of clearing up  failed compactions  when running on MS Windows.\r\n\r\n#2317 reverted the compaction code used on MS Windows that addressed #2315.\r\n\r\nPR has windows specific compaction code that uses a temporary file to record the name of the work-in-progress sub-directory used for a new compacted database. If there is a temporary file, it is used to delete the work-in-progress (i.e clear-up an incomplete compaction).\r\n\r\nThe clear-up code works for both Linux/Mac and Windows setups regardless of OS so copyting database around across operation systems still works.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Key commit messages start with the issue number (GH-xxxx, or if in JIRA, JENA-xxxx)\r\n\r\nBy submitting

issue resolved #2169\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n- added new interface Copyable<>\r\n  - implemented Copyable#copy in GraphMem2 all three descendants (Legacy, Fast and Roaring)\r\n  - extended TripleStore to implement Copyable<> and implemented it in all three descendants (Legacy, Fast and Roaring)\r\n- added copy constructors to mem2/collections/*, mem2/store/*/*Bunch, mem2/store/*/*HashMap and mem2/store/*/*Set\r\n- added unit tests to keep the test coverage for mem2/** at 100%\r\n- added benchmark for GraphMem2#copy\r\n- implemented new method G#copy which uses Copyable#copy if the graph implements it, otherwise G#copyGraphSrcToDst is used as fallback.\r\n  - added a unit test for G#copy\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [X] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ]
