The <code>stable</code> alias instals the latest stable version of Go. The <code>oldstable</code> alias installs previous latest minor release (the stable is 1.19.x -&gt; the oldstable is 1.18.x).</p>\n<h3>Stable</h3>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v3\n    with:\n      go-version: 'stable'\n  - run: go run hello.go\n</code></pre>\n<h3>OldStable</h3>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v3\n    with:\n      go-version: 'oldstable'\n  - run: go run hello.go\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Add support for go.work and pass the token input through on GHES</h2>\n<p>In scope of this release we added <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/actions/setup-go/pull/283\">support for go.work file to pass it in go-version-file input</a>.</p>\n<pre lang=\"yaml\"><code>steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n  - uses: actions/setup-go@v3\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

patch fixes the problem with uncheckd data\r\nconversion read from the network. Currently, code\r\nreads data from the network, converts it to\r\ni32, and then blindly converts it to usize (so -1\r\ngets converted to -1_usize and causes panic in\r\ndebug build and huge memory use in release build). \r\nThis could easily become a security vulnerability. \r\n\r\nThe fix replaces all `as usize` casts to try_into\r\nstyle casts.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\nThis change fixes a bug where the default values set in enum fields were unable to be serialized. Previously default enum values were being stored as enum objects upon initialization, where Thrift generally expects I32 values. With the changes in this pull request, serialization and deserialization are fixed and the python 3.4 style enums continue to work as expected.\r\n\r\nJIRA ticket here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5693\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [X] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [X] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [X] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [X] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [ ] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

changes introduced in 916ae8b8134630f49d32e47c3f0f3218f855a24c causes OSError when the socket is of IPv4 family.  This can be verified by the code snippet below (at least on RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 with Python 3.9):\r\n```python\r\nimport socket\r\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\r\ns.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IPV6, socket.IPV6_V6ONLY, 0)\r\n```\r\nThis will raise an exception `OSError: [Errno 92] Protocol not available`.\r\n\r\nMy fix is pretty simple: only set that IPv6 option when the socket family is IPv6.","created_at":"2023-03-17T00:36:42Z","updated_at":"2023-03-19T18:23:14Z","closed_at":"2023-03-17T22:57:54Z","merged_at":"2023-03-17T22:57:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae3e96bd33777e75e92f8947d51240fae5beeaa8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4722449056,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAS9U88AAAABGXraoA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/labels/python","name":"python","color":"006B75","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2770/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2770/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2770/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/967148cb2c0358e13ccb2c6ec805d78cfc9c33d8","head":{"label":"derkuci:py_setsockopt","ref":"py_setsockopt","sha":"967148cb2c0358e13ccb2c6ec805d78cfc9c33d8","user":{"login":"derkuci","id":525207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTIwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/525207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci","html_url":"https://github.com/derkuci","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derkuci/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f377dd3445362b5d5f051f549a12424663801894","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":310611,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTA2MTE=","name":"thrift","full_name":"apache/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/thrift","description":"Apache

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  ([Request account here](https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-account.html), not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing properly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What\r\n\r\nAdds unix domain sockets as a low level transport option for the Swift library\r\n\r\n## Why \r\n\r\nTo improve Swift language support in Thrift. \r\n\r\nThis change will, for example, enable the use of the popular [OSQuery library](https://github.com/osquery/osquery) natively in Swift (currently only supports Obj-C++)\r\n\r\n## How\r\n\r\nExtend the existing `TSocketServer` with a new initializer, taking a `path` input to a Unix domain socket path, and connecting to it. A new `UnixSocket` wrapper class was created for wrapping the different socket implementations in Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nAll changes are additive or equivalent; there are no breaking changes. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nEnables `domain` socket tests in the cross-test suite for Swift.\r\n\r\nSome cross-tests are failing due to other languages not implementing the `UUID` type or their implementation doesn't match the spec.\r\nAfter rebasing on master it seems the cross-tests also seem to not be running right now in CI due to a failure to build the go library

java\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to #2619, and applies the same change to all other types. This way, the generated field meta data is the same for all types, regardless of the order of definitions in the `.thrift` file.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation for this PR was to extend the change in the previous PR to enums. Then in order to keep the behavior consistent across all types, I applied it to other types. I've extended the tests to cover all cases.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is one behavioral change when it comes to typedefs. This PR and #2619 use `get_true_type()`, which means that whenever the field definition uses a typedef'd struct or enum (for example `typedef MyType MyTypedef`), the generated metadata will not use `FieldValueMetaData(..., \"MyTypedef\")`, but `FieldValueMetaData(..., MyType.class)` instead. But when we use something like `typedef i8 MyInt`, we generate `FieldValueMetaData(..., \"MyInt\")`.\r\nIs this acceptable?","created_at":"2023-03-05T12:46:56Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T06:58:09Z","closed_at":"2023-04-27T06:13:18Z","merged_at":"2023-04-27T06:13:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f63573f5a49fb564e7b65b9573769963511dbea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4288404393,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAS9U87_m9up","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/labels/java","name":"java","color":"ffa221","default":false,"description":"Pull

the default constructor and `operator==` implementations reference certain member functions of the class' members. As an example, the default constructor references (i.e., \"uses\") the default constructors of its members.\r\n\r\nIf a class contains a `std::vector<Foo>`, and `Foo` has only been *forward* declared (which happens often in Thrift-generated code), this creates undefined behavior: The `std::vector` specification states that as long as `Foo` is an incomplete type, it is fine to reference `std::vector<Foo>`, but not any members (such as its default constructor).\r\n\r\nThus, we must defer our default constructor's implementation (which references the default constructor of std::vector<Foo>) to a point where Foo is a complete type. That is the case in the .cpp file.\r\n\r\nThe same holds for operator==.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n======\r\n\r\nTake this very simple Thrift file:\r\n```\r\nstruct StructA {\r\n    11:required list<StructB> myBs\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct StructB\r\n{\r\n    1:required string someString\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I compile this using `thrift --gen cpp:no_skeleton -o out ./file.thrift` I get a header file that contains the following (full file [here](https://gist.github.com/tinloaf/1f7ae57df383d7b87221598e4f7a700d) ):\r\n\r\n```\r\n class StructA;\r\n class StructB;\r\n\r\n class StructA : … {\r\n  public:\r\n     …\r\n     StructA() noexcept {\r\n     }\r\n     …\r\n     std::vector<StructB>  myBs;\r\n     …\r\n };\r\n\r\n …\r\n\r\n class StructB : … {\r\n     …\r\n };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the default constructor for `StructA` references the default constructor of `std::vector<StructB>` while `StructB` is still an incomplete type. *This is undefined behavior.* It did apparently compile with all big compilers until recently, but with C++20, Clang 15 stops accepting this kind of construct, as you can see [here at CompilerExplorer](https://godbolt.org/z/xcc4av6cb).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChecklist\r\n======\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n  *Note:* As far as I can tell, no ticket exists for this.\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-08T08:51:10Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:22:35Z","closed_at":"2024-03-08T17:31:11Z","merged_at":"2024-03-08T17:31:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"9bd8f1e1acb23cb3ef134291e56b2605a7356b04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4722444709,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAAS9U88AAAABGXrJpQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/labels/c++","name":"c++","color":"4A3AB3","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2755/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2755/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2755/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/2d51167ce1ebb813863ea458f8eb70c4e915c9b9","head":{"label":"tinloaf:cpp-move-to-implementation","ref":"cpp-move-to-implementation","sha":"2d51167ce1ebb813863ea458f8eb70c4e915c9b9","user":{"login":"tinloaf","id":442687,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjY4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/442687?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf","html_url":"https://github.com/tinloaf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":595031227,"node_id":"R_kgDOI3d0uw","name":"thrift","full_name":"tinloaf/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tinloaf","id":442687,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjY4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/442687?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf","html_url":"https://github.com/tinloaf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tinloaf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tinloaf/thrift","description":"Apache

This matters on a big-endian host, where the conversion must swap bytes.\r\n\r\nThe big-endian letohll(n) failed because ntohl(n) is just n, doesn't swap n.

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->    \r\nCommit 042580f53441efe1bc5c80c89351fcb30740659e removed the `virtual` keyword from the declaration of `~TConnectedClient()`.\r\n    \r\nWhile mostly benign, it does cause a warning in some versions  of GCC (non-virtual destructors can result in undefined behaviour), which can throw off CI sometimes when building with `-Werror`.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?

Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\n- [ ] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\n- [ ] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\nThe json generator currently outputs the type `i32` for all enum fields. This commit changes it to output `enum` instead and output a `class` property with a reference to the actual enum type, similar to how it works for structs.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change for the json generator because it introduces a new type id (`enum`) which also includes a `class` reference.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nWe've seen a strange timeout error message like this:\r\n```\r\nTSocket::read() THRIFT_EAGAIN (timed out) after %f ms: Unknown error 30000\r\n```\r\nThe log comes from this line:\r\n```cpp\r\nGlobalOutput.perror(\"TSocket::read() THRIFT_EAGAIN (timed out) after %f ms\", recvTimeout_);\r\n```\r\nThe second argument of GlobalOutput.perror() is an errno. We should not use `recvTimeout_` on it:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/a2a1f535813511aa274ed328b2318cb2beb7bb08/lib/cpp/src/thrift/TOutput.h#L40\r\n```cpp\r\nclass TOutput {\r\n  ...\r\n  void perror(const char* message, int errno_copy);  // <-- The second arg is errno\r\n  ...\r\n  void printf(const char* message, ...);\r\n};\r\nTHRIFT_EXPORT extern TOutput GlobalOutput;\r\n```\r\nThe implementation of perror():\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid TOutput::perror(const char* message, int errno_copy) {\r\n  std::string out = message + std::string(\": \") + strerror_s(errno_copy);\r\n  f_(out.c_str());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt converts the errno to the error string, and 30000 is an unknown errno.\r\n\r\nWhat we want is to print the timeout threshold. We should use `GlobalOutput.printf()` instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the wrong usage of `GlobalOutput.perror()`. The error message will be\r\n```\r\nTSocket::read() THRIFT_EAGAIN (timed out) after 30000 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nThis will allow the Swift client library to be used with Swift Package Manager, as SPM requires a Package.swift to be at the root of the repository (much like we already have `Thrift.podspec`, `package.json`, `composer.json`, etc).\r\n\r\nI did not see the need to create a Jira ticket given how trivial this change is, but I can create one if preferred.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\nRemoves non-standard utf8 type with raw value 16 and replaces uuid raw value with 16. \r\nBrings Swift in compliance with spec: https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/0223d6346675c5089c2a2de5fb6f3858e599c9a9/doc/specs/thrift-binary-protocol.md?plain=1#L204\r\n\r\nThis is technically a breaking change by removing the utf8 type, however this type was non-standard and not documented in the spec.\r\n\r\nThis causes new failing crosstests with Swift-Java with the binary protocol due to Java not yet being updated to match the spec. \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing
