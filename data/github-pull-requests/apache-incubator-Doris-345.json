Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis CL mainly changes:\r\n\r\n1. Use a lru cache to cache all opened segments(Only for beta rowset, alpha rowset remain unchanged)\r\n\r\n    In the previous implementation, the segment instance is an object belonging to the rowset,\r\n    so if the rowset exists, the segment will always exist, resulting in memory usage.\r\n    In fact, the segment instance is only used in the data reading process. In principle, the segment\r\n    can be closed after the data reading is completed.\r\n\r\n    So here I use a lru cache to cache all open segments, and use SegmentLoader to uniformly manage\r\n    segment loading and closing.\r\n\r\n    Before:\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2899462/137098798-a09ee11c-4a99-48d3-b9c4-e50c8439f17c.png)\r\n\r\n    After using cache, the memory will no longer increase continously:\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2899462/137096097-03785244-b524-430d-8bee-cf0348a1f60a.png)\r\n\r\n    In addition to the cached segments being eliminated by the lru algorithm, there will also be threads\r\n    that regularly clean up segments that have not been used for a period of time.\r\n\r\n    Also, I modify the lru cache implementation, to add a `type` for the lru cache.\r\n    The type is either SIZE or NUMBER. SIZE is the default type, and NUMBER means the capacity of cache\r\n    is based on the number of cached entries, not the size of cached entries.\r\n\r\n    This is because currently we can not precisely calculate the memory usage of each opened segments.\r\n    So we have to use \"number\" to limit the max cached segments. But if later we get size, better to use SIZE.\r\n\r\n2. Optimize the usage statistics of lru cache\r\n\r\n    In the previous implementation, the usage of lru cache is only based on the size of cache value.\r\n    But for some cases, the cache key is larger than the value. So it is better to use both key and value\r\n    size to calculate the usage of lru.\r\n\r\n2. Let BE report immediately the first time it receive heartbeat from FE\r\n\r\n    If not do so, even if the backend is alive with success heartbeat, user can not create table because the\r\n    disk info is not reported yet.\r\n    And also add a random sleep for the report process to avoid too many reports proceed at same time.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #6828 ) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-13T08:27:55Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T02:07:15Z","closed_at":"2021-10-25T02:07:15Z","merged_at":"2021-10-25T02:07:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"ed7a873a44a61d511a8d46bc59480cde5cf26fff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly changes:\r\n\r\n1. Avoid sending tasks if there is no data to be consumed\r\n    By fetching latest offset of partition before sending tasks.(Fix #6803 )\r\n\r\n2. Add a `preCheckNeedSchedule` phase in update() of routine load.\r\n    To avoid taking write lock of job for long time when getting all kafka partitions from kafka server. \r\n\r\n3. Upgrade librdkafka's version to 1.7.0 to fix a bug of \"Local: Unknown partition\"\r\n    See https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/issues/3295\r\n\r\n4. Avoid unnecessary storage migration task if there is no that storage medium on BE.\r\n    Fix #6804\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [x] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe syntax:\r\n```\r\nselect k1, e1 from test lateral view explode_split(k1, \",\") tmp as e1;\r\n```\r\n```explode_split``` is a special function of doris,\r\nwhich is used to separate the string column according to the specified split string,\r\nand then convert the row to column.\r\nThis is a conforming function of string separation + table function,\r\nand its behavior is equivalent to explode in hive ```explode(split(string, string))```\r\n\r\nThe implement:\r\nA tablefunction operator is added to the implementation to handle the syntax of the lateral view

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the query plan thrift structure of a query may be very large\r\n(for example, when there are many columns in SQL), resulting in a large number\r\nof \"send fragment timeout\" errors.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an FE config  `use_compact_thrift_rpc` to control whether to transmit\r\nthe query plan in a compressed format.\r\n\r\nUsing compressed format transmission can reduce the size by ~50%. But it may reduce\r\nthe concurrency by ~10%. Therefore, in the high concurrency small query scenario,\r\nyou can choose to turn off compaction.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nModifying the view is equivalent to modifying the sql, but because the sql string has not changed, the query will hit the cached result before the view is modified.\r\n\r\nFix the bug that the cache cannot perceive view modification:\r\n- Add `updateTime` field to record the view update time\r\n- Use `originalSql + latestViewUpdateTime` as the input of the md5 function to generate a sql_key\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,
