What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nthe `Accumulable.internal` flag is only used to avoid registering internal accumulators for 2 certain cases:\n1. `TaskMetrics.createTempShuffleReadMetrics`: the accumulators in the temp shuffle read metrics should not be registered.\n2. `TaskMetrics.fromAccumulatorUpdates`: the created task metrics is only used to post event, accumulators inside it should not be registered.\n\nFor 1, we can create a `TempShuffleReadMetrics` that don't create accumulators, just keep the data and merge it at last.\nFor 2, we can un-register these accumulators immediately.\n\nTODO: remove `internal` flag in `AccumulableInfo` with followup PR\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis issue aims to expose Scala `bround` function in Python/R API.\n`bround` function is implemented in SPARK-14614 by extending current `round` function.\nWe used the following semantics from Hive.\n\n``` java\npublic static double bround(double input, int scale) {\n    if (Double.isNaN(input) || Double.isInfinite(input)) {\n      return input;\n    }\n    return BigDecimal.valueOf(input).setScale(scale, RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN).doubleValue();\n}\n```\n\nAfter this PR, `pyspark` and `sparkR` also support `bround` function.\n\n**PySpark**\n\n``` python\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import bround\n>>> sqlContext.createDataFrame([(2.5,)], ['a']).select(bround('a', 0).alias('r')).collect()\n[Row(r=2.0)]\n```\n\n**SparkR**\n\n``` r\n> df = createDataFrame(sqlContext, data.frame(x = c(2.5, 3.5)))\n> head(collect(select(df, bround(df$x, 0))))\n  bround(x, 0)\n1

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nthis PR fixes the issue SPARK-14736 Deadlock in registering applications while the Master is in the RECOVERING mode. \nProposed solution is to keep the registering apps in a separate list when the Master is in the RECOVERING mode and once the recovery is complete, these apps will be registered back. Pls refer the JIRA for more information \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI have tested the patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current benchmark framework runs a code block for several iterations and reports statistics. However there is no way to exclude per-iteration setup time from the overall results. This PR adds a timer control object passed into the closure that can be used for this purpose.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting benchmark code.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs the discussion at [SPARK-10574](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10574), `HashingTF` should support MurmurHash3 and make it as the default hash algorithm. We should also expose set/get API for `hashAlgorithm`, then users can choose the hash method.\n\nNote: The problem that `mllib.feature.HashingTF` behaves differently between Scala/Java and Python will be resolved in the followup work.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit tests.\n\ncc @jkbradley @MLnick

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, it looks `getOrElse(null)` is being used which just can be `orNull` sparsely for `Option`.\n\nIt looks [`orNull` calls `getOrElse(null)` internally](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/99a82be91cbb85239f70508f6695c6b21fd3558c/src/library/scala/Option.scala#L120-L132). So, using `orNull` instead of `getOrElse(null)` might be cleaner and simpler which calls the same logics.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis was tested after adding a rule in `scalastyle.conf` as below:\n\n``` xml\n<check customId=\"NoGetOrElseNull\" level=\"error\" class=\"org.scalastyle.file.RegexChecker\" enabled=\"true\">\n  <parameters><parameter name=\"regex\">\\.getOrElse\\(null\\)</parameter></parameters>\n</check>\n```\n\n(**The rule above was _not_ added**)\n\nAnd, `sbt scalastyle` was used.\n","created_at":"2016-04-19T10:17:49Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:47Z","closed_at":"2016-04-20T00:00:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2d95f5709f376f72958b1f6607b12f5cd12de79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12495/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12495/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12495/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c2a46097db8a8ef67c6069c04a52165f5a2d8e54","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:getorelse-ornull","ref":"getorelse-ornull","sha":"c2a46097db8a8ef67c6069c04a52165f5a2d8e54","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn Python, the `option` and `options` method of `DataFrameReader` and `DataFrameWriter` were sending the string \"None\" instead of `null` when passed `None`, therefore making it impossible to send an actual `null`. This fixes that problem.\n\nThis is based on #11305 from @mathieulongtin.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark currently uses TimSort for all in-memory sorts, including sorts done for shuffle. One low-hanging fruit is to use radix sort when possible (e.g. sorting by integer keys). This PR adds a radix sort implementation to the unsafe sort package and switches shuffles and sorts to use it when possible.\n\nThe current implementation does not have special support for null values, so we cannot radix-sort `LongType`. I will address this in a follow-up PR.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests, enabling radix sort on existing tests. Microbenchmark results:\n\n```\nRunning benchmark: radix sort 25000000\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_66-b17 on Linux 3.13.0-44-generic\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-4600U CPU @ 2.10GHz\n\nradix sort 25000000:                Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nreference TimSort key prefix array     15546 / 15859          1.6         621.9       1.0X\nreference Arrays.sort                    2416 / 2446         10.3          96.6       6.4X\nradix sort one byte                       133 /  137        188.4           5.3     117.2X\nradix sort two bytes                      255 /  258         98.2          10.2      61.1X\nradix sort eight bytes                    991 /  997         25.2          39.6      15.7X\nradix sort key prefix array              1540 / 1563         16.2          61.6      10.1X\n```\n\nI also ran a mix of the supported TPCDS queries and compared TimSort vs RadixSort metrics. The overall benchmark ran ~10% faster with radix sort on. In the breakdown below, the radix-enabled sort phases averaged about 20x faster than TimSort, however sorting is only a small fraction of the overall runtime. About half of the TPCDS queries were able to take advantage of radix sort.\n\n```\nTPCDS on master: 2499s real time, 8185s executor\n    - 1171s in TimSort, avg 267 MB/s\n(note the /s accounting is weird here since dataSize counts the record sizes too)\n\nTPCDS with radix enabled: 2294s real time, 7391s executor\n    - 596s in TimSort, avg 254 MB/s\n    - 26s in radix sort, avg 4.2 GB/s\n```\n\ncc @davies @rxin

if we call `streamingContext.stop` (e.g. in a `StreamingListener.onBatchCompleted` callback) when a batch is about to complete, a `rejectedException` may get thrown from `checkPointWriter.executor`, since the `eventLoop` will try to process `DoCheckpoint` events even after the `checkPointWriter.executor` was stopped.\n\nPlease see [SPARK-14701](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14701) for details and stack traces.\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nReversed the stopping order of `event loop` and `checkpoint writer`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting test suits.\n(no dedicated test suits were added because the change is simple to reason

change avoids using the environment to pass this information, since\nwith many jars it's easy to hit limits on certain OSes. Instead, it encodes\nthe information into the Spark configuration propagated to the AM.\n\nThe first problem that needed to be solved is a chicken & egg issue: the\nconfig file is distributed using the cache, and it needs to contain information\nabout the files that are being distributed. To solve that, the code now treats\nthe config archive especially, and uses slightly different code to distribute\nit, so that only its cache path needs to be saved to the config file.\n\nThe second problem is that the extra information would show up in the Web UI,\nwhich made the environment tab even more noisy than it already is when lots\nof jars are listed. This is solved by two changes: the list of cached files\nis now read only once in the AM, and propagated down to the ExecutorRunnable\ncode (which actually sends the list to the NMs when starting containers). The\nsecond change is to unset those config entries after the list is read, so that\nthe SparkContext never sees them.\n\nTested with both client and cluster mode by running \"run-example SparkPi\". This\nuploads a whole lot of files when run from a build dir (instead of a distribution,\nwhere the list is cleaned up), and I verified that the configs do not show\nup in the UI.\n","created_at":"2016-04-19T01:43:45Z","updated_at":"2016-04-29T19:43:44Z","closed_at":"2016-04-20T23:59:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1be68ba1e81e160dbdb43072ece009420cee9d89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12487/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12487/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12487/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/97f69a44fba7ab8a46696014ed70cd3ab6849d57","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-14602","ref":"SPARK-14602","sha":"97f69a44fba7ab8a46696014ed70cd3ab6849d57","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn Spark 2.0 we will have a new entry point for users known as the `SparkSession`. This class will handle the lazy initialization of the Hive metastore if the user runs commands that require interaction with the metastore (e.g. `CREATE TABLE`). With this, we can remove the `HiveContext`, which is an odd API to be exposed to Spark users.\n\nThis patch doesn't fully remove `HiveContext` but does most of the work. A follow-up patch will actually delete the file itself. I've left all the variable naming and any further refactor for later.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins.\n","created_at":"2016-04-19T01:11:01Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T20:51:09Z","closed_at":"2016-04-20T20:51:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e988fbb2c439e1d3c55c47b8cc1938102739f21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12485/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12485/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12485/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6e3c366a71f2dff1bbff59fd662b334fcc4798b8","head":{"label":"andrewor14:spark-session","ref":"spark-session","sha":"6e3c366a71f2dff1bbff59fd662b334fcc4798b8","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

PR makes two changes:\n- Use a random port between 17634 and 27634 to reduce the possibility of port conflicts.\n- Make `service1` use `service0.port` to bind to avoid the above race condition.\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBefore this PR, we create accumulators at driver side(and register them) and send them to executor side, then we create `TaskMetrics` with these accumulators at executor side.\nAfter this PR, we will create `TaskMetrics` at driver side and send it to executor side, so that we can create accumulators inside `TaskMetrics` directly, which is cleaner.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds equality and inequality overrides to `pyspark.sql.Row`. Without this override, `Row` simply uses the equality operator of `tuple`, which doesn't consider the private member `__fields__` of Row to determine the implicit ordering needed to compare the tuples correctly.\n\nWithout this PR, we get seemingly illogical equality checks like:\n\n```\nRow(a=1) == Row(b=1) # True\nr1 = Row('b', 'a')(2, 1) # Row(b=2, a=1)\nr1 == Row(b=2, a=1) # False\nr1 == Row(a=2, b=1) # True\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests were added to `pyspark/sql/types.py` in the `Row` docstring. A handful of newly failing tests in `pyspark/sql/tests.py` were fixed.\n\nThis PR is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source license.\n\n@davies @rxin

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12067, we now use expressions to do the aggregation in `TypedAggregateExpression`. To implement buffer merge, we produce a new buffer deserializer expression by replacing `AttributeReference` with right-side buffer attribute, like other `DeclarativeAggregate`s do, and finally combine the left and right buffer deserializer with `Invoke`.\n\nHowever, after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12338, we will add loop variable to class members when codegen `MapObjects`. If the `Aggregator` buffer type is `Seq`, which is implemented by `MapObjects` expression, we will add the same loop variable to class members twice(by left and right buffer deserializer), which cause the `ClassFormatError`.\n\nThis PR fixes this issue by calling `distinct` before declare the class menbers.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew regression test in `DatasetAggregatorSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-04-18T09:01:32Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T00:01:33Z","closed_at":"2016-04-19T17:54:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66cd0aadc26eae0abacc476d3a2a39433a7d15f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12468/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12468/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12468/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a57f8e69bb0eb371de69ca1b76409ec2ad483ae7","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:bug","ref":"bug","sha":"a57f8e69bb0eb371de69ca1b76409ec2ad483ae7","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSo far, we are capturing each unsupported Alter Table in separate visit functions.

comments.

This allows us to remove HiveContext later without inflating the diff too much. This PR fixes the conflicts of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12431. It also removes the `def hiveConf` from `HiveSqlParser`. So, we will pass the HiveConf associated with a session explicitly instead of relying on Hive's `SessionState` to pass `HiveConf`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n\nCloses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen users inputting invalid partition spec, we might not be able to catch and issue the error messages. Sometimes, it could cause a disaster result. For example, before the PR, when we alter a table and drop a partition with using unknown partitioning columns, we drop all the partitions due to a bug/defect in Hive Metastore API. \n\nThis PR is to add all the partition-related verification in `SessionCatalog`.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nFixed the illegal existing test cases and added new test cases.\n","created_at":"2016-04-16T16:36:52Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T22:29:31Z","closed_at":"2016-04-30T22:29:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b63c4525e7a5512661eeb648624895960a8e98db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12446/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12446/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12446/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f550bf852ca7c088266cbc8c8a24a068d65d1766","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:alterPartition","ref":"alterPartition","sha":"f550bf852ca7c088266cbc8c8a24a068d65d1766","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe DAG visualization can cause an OOM when generating the DOT file.\nThis happens because clusters are not correctly deduped by a contains\ncheck

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen a fetch failure occurs, the DAGScheduler re-launches the previous stage (to re-generate output that was missing), and then re-launches all tasks in the stage with the fetch failure that hadn't _completed_ when the fetch failure occurred (the DAGScheduler re-lanches all of the tasks whose output data is not available -- which is equivalent to the set of tasks that hadn't yet completed). This some times leads to wasteful duplicate task run for the jobs with long running task. \n\nTo address the issue following changes have been made.\n1.  When a fetch failure happens, the task set manager ask the dag scheduler to abort all the non-running tasks. However, the running tasks in the task set are not killed. \n2. When a task is aborted, the dag scheduler adds the task to the pending task list.\n3. In case of resubmission of the stage, the dag scheduler only resubmits the tasks which are in pending stage.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a new test case for it and made sure the test case failed without the change.\n","created_at":"2016-04-15T23:52:57Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T01:21:49Z","closed_at":"2016-12-22T04:32:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12436/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12436/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12436/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/042fe4301b7593deeade318ca8b779ac7902db7b","head":{"label":"sitalkedia:avoid_duplicate_tasks","ref":"avoid_duplicate_tasks","sha":"042fe4301b7593deeade318ca8b779ac7902db7b","user":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51496876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTQ5Njg3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"sitalkedia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds a special log for FileStreamSink for two purposes:\n- Versioning. A future Spark version should be able to read the metadata of an old FileStreamSink.\n- Compaction. As reading from many small files is usually pretty slow, we should compact small metadata files into big files.\n\nFileStreamSinkLog has a new log format instead of Java serialization format. It will write one log file for each batch. The first line of the log file is the version number, and there are multiple JSON lines following. Each JSON line is a JSON format of FileLog.\n\nFileStreamSinkLog will compact log files every \"spark.sql.sink.file.log.compactLen\" batches into a big file. When doing a compact, it will read all history logs and merge them with the new batch. During the compaction, it will also delete the files that are deleted (marked by FileLog.action). When the reader uses allLogs to list all files, this method only returns the visible files (drops the deleted files).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nFileStreamSinkLogSuite\n","created_at":"2016-04-15T23:24:17Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T09:10:33Z","closed_at":"2016-04-20T20:35:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5855365a1c1e0c6f6b70a217247fb617ffe58322","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12435/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12435/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12435/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e2cd25c0934ba8a0062c29524c27785326dde195","head":{"label":"zsxwing:sink-log","ref":"sink-log","sha":"e2cd25c0934ba8a0062c29524c27785326dde195","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4df65184b6b865a26e4d5c99bbfd3c24ab7179dc","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

`Await.result` throws an exception which originated from a different thread, the resulting stacktrace doesn't include the path leading to the `Await.result` call itself, making it difficult to identify the impact of these exceptions. For example, I've seen cases where broadcast cleaning errors propagate to the main thread and crash it but the resulting stacktrace doesn't include any of the main thread's code, making it difficult to pinpoint which exception crashed that thread.\n\nThis patch addresses this issue by explicitly catching, wrapping, and re-throwing exceptions that are thrown by `Await.result`.\n\nI tested this manually using https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark/commit/16b31c825197ee31a50214c6ba3c1df08148f403, a patch which reproduces an issue where an RPC exception which occurs while unpersisting RDDs manages to crash the main thread without any useful stacktrace, and verified that informative, full stacktraces were generated after applying the fix in this PR.\n\n/cc @rxin @nongli @yhuai @anabranch

This tends to occur when using a mix of transformers from ml.feature. It is because Java Arrays are non-covariant and the addition of MLWritable to some transformers means the stages0/1 arrays above are not of type Array[PipelineStage].

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nOn the SparkUI right now we have this SQLTab that displays accumulator values per operator. However, it only displays metrics updated on the executors, not on the driver. It is useful to also include driver metrics, e.g. broadcast time.\n\nAfter this patch you can update metrics defined in `SparkPlan.metrics` in `doConsume` (if whole stage codegen is enabled) or `doExecute`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`SQLListenerSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-04-15T21:26:24Z","updated_at":"2016-05-16T18:05:20Z","closed_at":"2016-05-16T18:05:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc65ef3d629b9b37db858e4d441b3e6e2a4559b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1cd3995386ced6e53308ba288942f806183b9eda","head":{"label":"andrewor14:sql-metrics-driver","ref":"sql-metrics-driver","sha":"1cd3995386ced6e53308ba288942f806183b9eda","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds a new function in SparkR called `sparkLapply(list, function)`. This function implements a distributed version of `lapply` using Spark as a backend.\n\nTODO:\n- [x] check documentation\n- [ ] check tests\n\nTrivial example in SparkR:\n\n``` R\nsparkLapply(1:5, function(x) { 2 * x })\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n[[1]]\n[1] 2\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 6\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 8\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 10\n```\n\nHere is a slightly more complex example to perform distributed training of multiple models. Under the hood, Spark broadcasts the dataset.\n\n``` R\nlibrary(\"MASS\")\ndata(menarche)\nfamilies <- c(\"gaussian\", \"poisson\")\ntrain <- function(family){glm(Menarche ~ Age  , family=family, data=menarche)}\nresults <- sparkLapply(families, train)\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis PR was tested in SparkR. I am unfamiliar with R and SparkR, so any feedback on style, testing, etc. will be much appreciated.\n\ncc @falaki @davies
