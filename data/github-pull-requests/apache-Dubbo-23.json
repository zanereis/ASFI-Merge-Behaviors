easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-30T07:22:09Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T09:33:46Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T09:33:46Z","merged_at":"2023-01-30T09:33:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1b3e55b19910a3817d1bd6ff1a7b00876fa1283","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/81f9259e0e17c083b304255fc0e191dc2ca0f3f2","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0130_chm","ref":"0130_chm","sha":"81f9259e0e17c083b304255fc0e191dc2ca0f3f2","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-29T14:07:03Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T03:22:54Z","closed_at":"2023-01-30T03:16:11Z","merged_at":"2023-01-30T03:16:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"f73eee9ffee24c98ee13349cdf8e81ceef0960fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a3d8f89ce95084d60eb3abc877b2ace5e5692a83","head":{"label":"songxiaosheng:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"a3d8f89ce95084d60eb3abc877b2ace5e5692a83","user":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":534049587,"node_id":"R_kgDOH9TzMw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"songxiaosheng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"songxiaosheng","id":81170548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTcwNTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81170548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng","html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songxiaosheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/songxiaosheng/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-20T02:36:58Z","updated_at":"2023-01-20T06:11:22Z","closed_at":"2023-01-20T06:03:42Z","merged_at":"2023-01-20T06:03:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"704a08d0248a1cf9dc50fe3c76a943ad99de6122","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11358/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11358/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11358/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/976350f3a3571ed3bc80c2de9266f8eddd0dad65","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/support_native_ci_check","ref":"feat/support_native_ci_check","sha":"976350f3a3571ed3bc80c2de9266f8eddd0dad65","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.  (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9819\">#9819</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the aarch64 build on macOS until it can be fixed. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9816\">#9816</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1-rc1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.0</h2>\n<p>2022-03-25 version 3.20.0 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Objective-C/C#/Ruby/JavaScript)</p>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped Ruby 2.3 and 2.4 support for CI and releases. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9311\">#9311</a>)</li>\n<li>Added Ruby 3.1 support for CI and releases (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9566\">#9566</a>).</li>\n<li>Message.decode/encode: Add recursion_limit option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9218\">#9218</a>/<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9486\">#9486</a>)</li>\n<li>Allocate with xrealloc()/xfree() so message allocation is visible to the\nRuby GC.  In certain tests this leads to much lower memory usage due to more\nfrequent GC runs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9586\">#9586</a>).</li>\n<li>Fix conversion of singleton classes in Ruby (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9342\">#9342</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen I was writing registry metric implement, I will  use some codes of metrics-api, and found that some codes might be optimized.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nMainly optimize the following aspects:\r\n\r\n1. Object-oriented design optimization\r\n\r\n- The quadruple of interfaceName, methodName, group, version, which appears frequently and  use together, can be replaced by an object\r\n- Both DefaultMetricsCollector and MetricsStatComposite have the behavior of publishing MetricsEvent. MetricsStatComposite locates the data aggregation carrier and should only be responsible for the processing of internal data. Event registration and publishing should be managed by a separate class (refer to spring), and the separation of class responsibilities can be easier Scale and prevent single-class code bloat.\r\n\r\n2. Optimization of memory usage\r\n\r\n- Every time the method (invoke, onResponse, onError) in MetricsFilter is triggered, the new temporary object MetricsCollectExecutor will be created. This is unnecessary. Changing to the statc method can reduce the number of yong gc.\r\n\r\n3. Optimization of some repetitive codes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n主要对以下几个方面做了优化：\r\n\r\n1、面向对象的设计优化\r\n\r\n- interfaceName,  methodName,  group,  version 这个四元组，出现频率高且共同使用，可以使用对象代替\r\n- DefaultMetricsCollector 和 MetricsStatComposite 两个类都有发布MetricsEvent的行为，MetricsStatComposite定位数据聚合载体，应该只负责内部数据的处理，事件注册和发布应该由单独的类来管理（参考spring），类职责分离可以更容易扩展和防止单类代码膨胀。\r\n\r\n2、内存使用的优化\r\n\r\n-    MetricsFilter里的方法（invoke,onResponse,onError）每次触发，会new临时对象MetricsCollectExecutor，这是没必要的，改成statc方法可以减少yong

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-19T06:58:26Z","updated_at":"2023-01-20T02:12:55Z","closed_at":"2023-01-20T02:12:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f55e9544de97b80df16b4b7f2b2b52eb5c2957b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11350/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11350/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11350/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/73c1c60a419eae0096170c03cae4d4f1431636ae","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feat/support_graalvm_ci","ref":"feat/support_graalvm_ci","sha":"73c1c60a419eae0096170c03cae4d4f1431636ae","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.2</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed composer.json to only advertise compatibility with PHP 7.0+.  (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9819\">#9819</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the aarch64 build on macOS until it can be fixed. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9816\">#9816</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.1-rc1</h2>\n<h1>PHP</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix building packaged PHP extension (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9727\">#9727</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix versioning issues in 3.20.0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.20.0</h2>\n<p>2022-03-25 version 3.20.0 (C++/Java/Python/PHP/Objective-C/C#/Ruby/JavaScript)</p>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Dropped Ruby 2.3 and 2.4 support for CI and releases. (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9311\">#9311</a>)</li>\n<li>Added Ruby 3.1 support for CI and releases (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9566\">#9566</a>).</li>\n<li>Message.decode/encode: Add recursion_limit option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9218\">#9218</a>/<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9486\">#9486</a>)</li>\n<li>Allocate with xrealloc()/xfree() so message allocation is visible to the\nRuby GC.  In certain tests this leads to much lower memory usage due to more\nfrequent GC runs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9586\">#9586</a>).</li>\n<li>Fix conversion of singleton classes in Ruby (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9342\">#9342</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #11308, a Dependabot config is helpful for maintaining the project. For now, the config is set up to only suggest minor or patch version updates as its main intention is to keep up with bug and vulnerability fixes. Major version updates rarely can be automated as they usually break the build. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThis will add a Dependabot config with the following properties:\r\n- Runs every Monday at 3am eastern time\r\n- Will ignore major version updates\r\n- Never has more than 20 open PRs at any given time\r\n\r\n## Additional points\r\n- The above properties are a suggestion and I'm happy to discuss any changes.\r\n- I performed a dry-run and Dependabot will initially create a bunch of PRs (roughly 20). That will be a bit of work to go through them.\r\n- Unfortunately it is not possible to exclude subfolders from the scan. So it would also suggest to upgrade the Spring version in `dubbo-test/dubbo-test-spring3.2/pom.xml` for example although the version there is intentional. These kind of PRs would have to be fixed manually.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-18T14:36:25Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T12:50:41Z","closed_at":"2023-01-19T02:02:13Z","merged_at":"2023-01-19T02:02:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"d4b2accff1323398fabf82c7e3156f2aeaf0ad35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4548e03fd5e13ced82cdf923fb98b102da6cf504","head":{"label":"fomeiherz:issue_11321","ref":"issue_11321","sha":"4548e03fd5e13ced82cdf923fb98b102da6cf504","user":{"login":"fomeiherz","id":8408589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDg1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8408589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz","html_url":"https://github.com/fomeiherz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":588588217,"node_id":"R_kgDOIxUkuQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"fomeiherz/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fomeiherz","id":8408589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDg1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8408589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz","html_url":"https://github.com/fomeiherz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fomeiherz/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-18T10:05:13Z","updated_at":"2023-01-20T01:48:09Z","closed_at":"2023-01-19T15:07:12Z","merged_at":"2023-01-19T15:07:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2eb0ef4589b956d1648d6809cffd0a9966f5eb6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11326/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11326/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11326/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4b6f5488300cecb98a03a04780e8d24f81a57601","head":{"label":"mxsm:dubbo-11294","ref":"dubbo-11294","sha":"4b6f5488300cecb98a03a04780e8d24f81a57601","user":{"login":"mxsm","id":15797831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk3ODMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15797831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxsm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":588621178,"node_id":"R_kgDOIxWleg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mxsm/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mxsm","id":15797831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzk3ODMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15797831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm","html_url":"https://github.com/mxsm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mxsm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mxsm/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-17T15:52:49Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T11:51:44Z","closed_at":"2023-03-13T11:51:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2492d7d0f4b5d2776b3f6cdf8aff11df906fa2f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/07d20bbdace81686c615e567b8452d2470405119","head":{"label":"gsralex:add_window_rt_avg","ref":"add_window_rt_avg","sha":"07d20bbdace81686c615e567b8452d2470405119","user":{"login":"gsralex","id":2240270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDAyNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2240270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex","html_url":"https://github.com/gsralex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":392678450,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTI2Nzg0NTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"gsralex/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gsralex","id":2240270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDAyNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2240270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex","html_url":"https://github.com/gsralex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsralex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gsralex/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-14T13:58:24Z","updated_at":"2023-01-16T02:22:20Z","closed_at":"2023-01-16T02:22:20Z","merged_at":"2023-01-16T02:22:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e0971edcd98971c0ccc1da4164ce451448d11093","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d26b0a67e49044aa687e6160f30e70f25d41ba4e","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0114_update","ref":"0114_update","sha":"d26b0a67e49044aa687e6160f30e70f25d41ba4e","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-14T06:32:42Z","updated_at":"2023-01-14T07:05:20Z","closed_at":"2023-01-14T06:32:48Z","merged_at":"2023-01-14T06:32:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"f9b27eddef0ea40f17314320ce38f4368e7ca1ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11298/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11298/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11298/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/977a108206710bfb18d43ddfe6e848256697ef92","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0114_register","ref":"0114_register","sha":"977a108206710bfb18d43ddfe6e848256697ef92","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-14T02:43:41Z","updated_at":"2023-01-16T06:16:49Z","closed_at":"2023-01-16T06:16:48Z","merged_at":"2023-01-16T06:16:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"af1825e72b45352d3d8eb460773b6a204463ee74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11295/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11295/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11295/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/93abf3b26b82e13c381701ee0bb1cb8133935d65","head":{"label":"fomeiherz:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"93abf3b26b82e13c381701ee0bb1cb8133935d65","user":{"login":"fomeiherz","id":8408589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDg1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8408589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz","html_url":"https://github.com/fomeiherz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":588588217,"node_id":"R_kgDOIxUkuQ","name":"dubbo","full_name":"fomeiherz/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fomeiherz","id":8408589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDg1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8408589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz","html_url":"https://github.com/fomeiherz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fomeiherz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fomeiherz/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-12T11:34:18Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T01:48:48Z","closed_at":"2023-01-13T01:48:48Z","merged_at":"2023-01-13T01:48:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1356d93c795406fafd58b627381a639d8973506","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11292/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/11292/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/11292/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b9c89ad7a85d7179683b40489358baa756d7a3ae","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0112_add_check_opt","ref":"0112_add_check_opt","sha":"b9c89ad7a85d7179683b40489358baa756d7a3ae","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.19.5</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.19.4</h2>\n<h1>Python</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Make libprotobuf symbols local on OSX to fix issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9395\">#9395</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9435\">#9435</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a data loss bug that could occur when the number of <code>optional</code> fields in a message is an exact multiple of 32.

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.19.6</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.19.5</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.19.4</h2>\n<h1>Python</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Make libprotobuf symbols local on OSX to fix issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9395\">#9395</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9435\">#9435</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a data loss bug that could occur when the number of <code>optional</code> fields in a message is an exact multiple of 32.

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.19.6</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards.

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.19.6</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.19.5</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce memory consumption of MessageSet parsing</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-8gq9-2x98-w8hf\">Security Advisory for C++ and Python users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.19.4</h2>\n<h1>Python</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Make libprotobuf symbols local on OSX to fix issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9395\">#9395</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9435\">#9435</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ruby</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a data loss bug that could occur when the number of <code>optional</code> fields in a message is an exact multiple of 32.
