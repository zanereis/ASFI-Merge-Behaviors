contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-22T03:29:01Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:21Z","closed_at":"2018-02-23T09:24:50Z","merged_at":"2018-02-23T09:24:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2477511458eaa12a80bbad6e3f44d5efe714c30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1381/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1381/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1381/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f2477511458eaa12a80bbad6e3f44d5efe714c30","head":{"label":"apache:2.5.x","ref":"2.5.x","sha":"f2477511458eaa12a80bbad6e3f44d5efe714c30","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix #1283 Ensure we can build Dubbo on Java 9\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Update maven-javadoc-plugin version\r\n2. Disable doclint by default and adapt to new maven-javadoc-plugin format\r\n3. Update fastjson version\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\nPolish: use Collection.isEmpty()\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nUsing Collection.size() to test for emptiness works, but using Collection.isEmpty() makes the code more readable and can be more performant. The time complexity of any isEmpty() method implementation should be O(1) whereas some implementations of size() can be O(n).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-03T00:26:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-25T14:49:12Z","closed_at":"2018-02-08T08:20:01Z","merged_at":"2018-02-08T08:20:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"d129f10229869bb8be3aff0787cd6303eb0e5ad0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1315/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1315/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1315/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8e32f75710b75262617a30b0439587970c21ee67","head":{"label":"igor-suhorukov:master","ref":"master","sha":"8e32f75710b75262617a30b0439587970c21ee67","user":{"login":"igor-suhorukov","id":10332206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzMyMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10332206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov","html_url":"https://github.com/igor-suhorukov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igor-suhorukov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"98c548aab1fef47b29cf7af451b7cd447205ec0a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-31T10:55:25Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:18Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T05:27:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/40bb7298d05aa62bbc4b7bc2c03f0fd302744042","head":{"label":"wzlee:master","ref":"master","sha":"40bb7298d05aa62bbc4b7bc2c03f0fd302744042","user":{"login":"wzlee","id":4182865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODI4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4182865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee","html_url":"https://github.com/wzlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":107927345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDc5MjczNDU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wzlee/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzlee","id":4182865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODI4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4182865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee","html_url":"https://github.com/wzlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzlee/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-18T16:31:50Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T22:34:52Z","closed_at":"2018-01-19T02:47:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fbf773f8401a7d06e20dd69f31258715871d51dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1239/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1239/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1239/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7d84c2450552bfa2a69de7d14876484321beef9e","head":{"label":"akun2014:master","ref":"master","sha":"7d84c2450552bfa2a69de7d14876484321beef9e","user":{"login":"akun2014","id":10229751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjI5NzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10229751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akun2014","html_url":"https://github.com/akun2014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akun2014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akun2014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akun2014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akun2014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akun2014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akun2014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akun2014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akun2014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akun2014/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"09722e3a93ad4ba40edf38ebdbfd7afee4977ee6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix #1233\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nfix #1233\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nfix #1233 , it's an abstract method of  FailbackRegistry , so the subclasses need to be modified together\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-18T11:36:42Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:15Z","closed_at":"2018-01-19T08:51:27Z","merged_at":"2018-01-19T08:51:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7cd88993a56b9cef588df4d728698930f90c65a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2e60c0b4771fc82e66d3e5f0a3c8fea3c0b4cdfc","head":{"label":"hqq2023623:fix#1233","ref":"fix#1233","sha":"2e60c0b4771fc82e66d3e5f0a3c8fea3c0b4cdfc","user":{"login":"hqq2023623","id":6971152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzExNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6971152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623","html_url":"https://github.com/hqq2023623","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113030978,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTMwMzA5Nzg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"hqq2023623/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hqq2023623","id":6971152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NzExNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6971152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623","html_url":"https://github.com/hqq2023623","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hqq2023623/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hqq2023623/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-15T05:48:43Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:14Z","closed_at":"2018-01-16T08:25:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01ed58015e7db507aec650040e4cecaba28532a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/df08000225e3cf0cc16dbca99a5f4df99f98bc85","head":{"label":"Percy0601:master","ref":"master","sha":"df08000225e3cf0cc16dbca99a5f4df99f98bc85","user":{"login":"Percy0601","id":5001210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDEyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5001210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Percy0601","html_url":"https://github.com/Percy0601","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Percy0601/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Percy0601/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Percy0601/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Percy0601/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Percy0601/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Percy0601/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Percy0601/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Percy0601/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Percy0601/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c2cc20cff49980fbe530fa9ce70049299a861266","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-09T13:47:27Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:13Z","closed_at":"2018-01-16T03:14:38Z","merged_at":"2018-01-16T03:14:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"926a7194bf839931ef4463c7c537486b1cecfdf3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1191/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1191/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1191/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/926a7194bf839931ef4463c7c537486b1cecfdf3","head":{"label":"apache:2.6","ref":"2.6","sha":"926a7194bf839931ef4463c7c537486b1cecfdf3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-09T02:58:02Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:12Z","closed_at":"2018-01-09T02:59:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1185/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1185/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1185/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7d39f91b8ca4f03d46ea163b27893c6e23a803dd","head":{"label":"zhongxigong:master","ref":"master","sha":"7d39f91b8ca4f03d46ea163b27893c6e23a803dd","user":{"login":"zhongxigong","id":19359390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzU5Mzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19359390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxigong","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongxigong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxigong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxigong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxigong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxigong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxigong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxigong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxigong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxigong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxigong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f371d78e1f3f58d463f89bb6a7da14906b43dfc7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix several problems in ConsistentHashLoadBalance\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. It didn't support generic invoke\r\n2. The identityHashCode always change when invoking, it cause the rebuilding of hash cycle\r\n3. I want to replace the reference in virtualInvokers by the invoke address. It seems to be my personal style, I don't hope a tool like ConsistentHashLoadBalance to catch the reference of Invoker which is important in the whole flow\r\n4. Add a test to run loadbalance\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. Start the LoadbalanceProvider and LoadbalanceProvider2 to be the two provider. Only one provider the loadbalance will not work\r\n2. Run LoadbalanceConsumer. And the same param invoke will send to the same provider, no matter whether the invoke is send by generic or not\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-29T10:03:43Z","updated_at":"2019-07-17T06:19:39Z","closed_at":"2018-06-01T07:01:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3fc490b719e421eab6a3e7fc68c577a1475a8720","assignee":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/10c4bd6295e0951a7fda639214788ad7156b960f","head":{"label":"kirayunfei:fixConsistentHashBranch","ref":"fixConsistentHashBranch","sha":"10c4bd6295e0951a7fda639214788ad7156b960f","user":{"login":"kirayunfei","id":20149740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTQ5NzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20149740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei","html_url":"https://github.com/kirayunfei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115496399,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU0OTYzOTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kirayunfei/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kirayunfei","id":20149740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTQ5NzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20149740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei","html_url":"https://github.com/kirayunfei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirayunfei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kirayunfei/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-28T07:31:11Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T03:01:01Z","closed_at":"2017-12-28T07:31:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f080233c349a637d46c79c5d1c7fd92153c936bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/19177e1aacfb6bda3c5699f44f596135357be403","head":{"label":"ylsn19821104:master","ref":"master","sha":"19177e1aacfb6bda3c5699f44f596135357be403","user":{"login":"ylsn19821104","id":19267290,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjY3Mjkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19267290?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ylsn19821104","html_url":"https://github.com/ylsn19821104","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ylsn19821104/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ylsn19821104/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ylsn19821104/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ylsn19821104/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ylsn19821104/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ylsn19821104/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ylsn19821104/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ylsn19821104/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ylsn19821104/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7322f3ead103c4acbe2123404add364745a0a054","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-28T06:32:31Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:10Z","closed_at":"2017-12-28T06:33:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0a69d047ec0ea58695c96b2bc5e6d8f7eccae6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1133/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1133/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1133/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5524e1774bdecd3093667143e9c6cd4b62483c14","head":{"label":"shuohao:master","ref":"master","sha":"5524e1774bdecd3093667143e9c6cd4b62483c14","user":{"login":"shuohao","id":4637107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzcxMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4637107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuohao","html_url":"https://github.com/shuohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7322f3ead103c4acbe2123404add364745a0a054","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-23T12:27:57Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:09Z","closed_at":"2017-12-23T12:42:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1096/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1096/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1096/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a7c1748c66da5229659645cc87f10be468fcee23","head":{"label":"werwolfGu:master","ref":"master","sha":"a7c1748c66da5229659645cc87f10be468fcee23","user":{"login":"werwolfGu","id":13844184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODQ0MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13844184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/werwolfGu","html_url":"https://github.com/werwolfGu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werwolfGu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werwolfGu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werwolfGu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werwolfGu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werwolfGu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werwolfGu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werwolfGu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werwolfGu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/werwolfGu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6a83ab5041772887a970997e1b11d1d1445a3249","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-13T21:45:20Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:06Z","closed_at":"2018-02-24T08:26:32Z","merged_at":"2018-02-24T08:26:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"b52879c4e1133a51e82dcbf6eb0c3c2c6e733d8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFix some bugs find in dubbo-admin\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. Fixed #466, use relative path when redirect\r\n2. Fixed #972, promotion error of 'batch recover' on 'application' tab\r\n3. Fix dubbo-admin, cache refresh problem when service changed\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nMostly web redirect change, verify by deploy dubbo-admin and visit on browser.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n目前不管是用的最多的2.5.3版本还是最新的2.5.7版本，亲自测试在不设置重试机制下是无法做到优雅停机的，这次改动主要是修改一点点代码，加上可配置的等待时间，就能简单的做到“不开启重试也能优雅停机”。\r\n\r\n其主要实现机制就是在【provider断连注册中心之后，关闭应答之前】和【consumer移除掉invoker后，关闭client之前】这两个阶段加入可配置的等待时间，目前亲测可以做到不配置重试也能优雅停机。\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFix some bugs find in dubbo-admin\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n1. Fixed #466, use relative path when redirect\r\n2. Fixed #972, promotion error of 'batch recover' on 'application' tab\r\n3. Fix dubbo-admin, cache refresh problem when service changed\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nMostly web redirect change, verify by deploy dubbo-admin and visit on browser.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-07T12:25:01Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:05Z","closed_at":"2017-12-11T04:50:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d11a578ea232e837b81979b908b0082ebe12904","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1008/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1008/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1008/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9fa27f8c239469fb2a84b0f684a8357497216d39","head":{"label":"chickenlj:dubbo-admin_bugfix","ref":"dubbo-admin_bugfix","sha":"9fa27f8c239469fb2a84b0f684a8357497216d39","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"bdd2c604d6b462f3d62a7e86bd9bcb9c43b0cfc9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.
