Currently we only allow precision upto Float32 in Scala as a result of which there are issues when one tries to load a model trained using float64 (in another language binding).\r\n\r\nThis also fixes two long standing issues : fixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11315 & fixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10338\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n- Need to complete the F64 support in other classes as well, and then test out and compare training of a model using float32 and float64. The comparison would be in terms of the precision of the loss, accuracy of the trained model, memory occupied by the model during training process.

well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-18T19:59:05Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T00:28:31Z","closed_at":"2018-12-19T00:28:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e671adb5e34222166151024e4eeef9668001f8be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

reverts commit 3433776dac7be75928082bbc1d552fca248fb8e8.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nRe-enable jetson compilation. CCache is now disabled for Jetson since it was not finding NVCC. It will be addressed in subsequent PRs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nThis is a second batch of fixes for several sorting operators.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] topk\r\n- [X] test_large_array.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Removed dtype for topk operator for indices. It seems unnecessary (and confusing) to have float32 as a type for indices and not clear why user would ever want to define it. This may cause backward compatibility issue only if users set dtype for return indices of a topK operator.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-18T00:39:12Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T18:34:14Z","closed_at":"2019-06-04T05:45:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b62d9eaf89646126eece91f02cb07c245cbc8e11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nDLPack allows strides is `nullptr` if the tensor is compact.\r\nHowever, there are some frameworks, like DGL and PyTorch, which don't accept the DLPack whose strides is `nullptr`.\r\n\r\nFix: #13658 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fill the strides if the strides is `nullptr`.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-17T09:39:18Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T01:30:43Z","closed_at":"2018-12-19T01:30:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e147605c76fc163a69d4abe38ed71dfb514490c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR is the first step for [MXNET-1252]. The goal for this PR is to change the dependency tree from \"nnvm_to_onnx -> tensorrt\" to \"tensorrt -> nnvm_to_onnx\". This enables the possibility of converting nnvm to other inference library.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] NNVM to TRT: ran unit tests: tests/python/tensorrt\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This is not a backward incompatible change; all changes are internal\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-17T02:35:38Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T18:39:02Z","closed_at":"2018-12-19T18:39:02Z","merged_at":"2018-12-19T18:39:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"f85b17b8dd647f8d286ebc51cd2e582b2a829d41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to remove mklml pre-install in CI and use a downloaded one while building.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv  @marcoabreu

https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12255\r\ndoing import mxnet in multiple processes take very long time.\r\nDetails : #12255\r\nOne of the reason we have OMP tuning code which iterates to find OMP\r\ntune overhead. We are reducing this iteration count to reduce the\r\noverehead of tuning code.\r\nAlso, We added an environment variable where users can set the number\r\nof cores that should be used to determine

Description ##\r\nAdds the gradient multiplier operator that is mostly used in unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation. \r\nIn short: on forward pass it acts as identity transform; on backwards it multiplies the gradients with a scalar constant (lambda).\r\nSee full description here: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/ganin15.pdf\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to

MKLDNN is dynamically linked to mxnet. This can cause some issues if another version of mkldnn is present on the host machine and mxnet links to the host version. This change statically builds mkldnn into mxnet to handle version issues on linux/mac but keeps it dynamically linked on windows.\r\n\r\nremoved test_mkldnn_install.py from test as well since it tests if mkldnn is dynamically linked on linux (which it is no longer is)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

is a follow up of: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1224\r\nA design was posted: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Scala+maven+build+improvement\r\n\r\n1. Automatically detect which platform to build for scala.\r\n2. Remove platform dependend submodules\r\n3. Fix cyclic module dependencies\r\n4. Fix scalatype style check\r\n5. Now mvn can be executed in submodule\r\n6. Maven build can be executed from any directory not only in root project\r\n7. Checkin javah header file, and use verify task to detect native API changes\r\n8. Improve incremental build performance\r\n9. Remove unittest and integration-test profile, use proper task instead\r\n10. Delete generated scala file during maven clean.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nAdd tests for MKLDNN batch norm operator The creates ndarray inputs and then runs it separately through the native CPU BN operator and MKLDNN BN operator. Creating the BN test requires a different test helper as the BN operation writes to the input, so identical arrays of equal value must be created and then ran through the native / MKLDNN operators.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to fix omp bug in `multibox_detection` to avoid accuracy variance of SSD topology.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nWith this change:\r\n- `ToTensor` transformation operator can take 3D (h, w, c) or 4D (n, h, w, c) at once.\r\n- `Normalize` transformation operator can take 3D (c, h, w) or 4D (n, c, h, w) at once.\r\n- Also parallelized the operator with omp\r\n- This change will be required to fuse transformation pipeline with network graph during inference. Where inputs are usually 4D inputs (n, c, h, w).\r\n- This is backward compatible change, this do not change any existing behavior.\r\n\r\nIn another PR, I will work on to support list of 3D tensors (list of images) as input for different shape image tensors use case.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Support 3D or 4D input tensors to to_tensor and normalize transformation operator.\r\n\r\n### TODO ###\r\n- API documentation updates.

Description ##\r\nAdd pos_weight for SigmoidBinaryCrossEntropyLoss.\r\nA value `pos_weights > 1` decreases the false negative count, hence increasing the recall.\r\nConversely setting `pos_weights < 1` decreases the false positive count and increases the precision.\r\nThis can be seen from the fact that `pos_weight` is introduced as a multiplicative coefficient for the positive targets term in the loss expression:\r\n    label * -log(sigmoid(pred)) * pos_weight + (1 - label) * -log(1 - sigmoid(pred))\r\n\r\nIt's adopted from [tensorflow's implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.12/tensorflow/python/ops/nn_impl.py#L187)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-11T08:03:22Z","updated_at":"2019-03-08T06:08:21Z","closed_at":"2019-03-08T06:07:52Z","merged_at":"2019-03-08T06:07:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"ce9e3cf1daba3dc2c41233af9bb43f25ded94aa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

Description ##\r\nFixes #11064\r\nIt passes the test whose `MXNET_TEST_SEED=35650200`. \r\n\r\nThe old unittest for ROIAlign computes in `float64`, so there is some float precision problem.\r\nFixes #11064\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] use `float32` in the unittest for ROIAlign OP\r\n- [x] set `atol` to `1e-5` in the unittest for ROIAlign OP\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-11T03:22:31Z","updated_at":"2019-02-05T23:21:07Z","closed_at":"2019-02-05T19:38:22Z","merged_at":"2019-02-05T19:38:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c7af3ab5794cd66d69192f20b4cf1ea2852afd9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":721783490,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Test","name":"Test","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

Description ##\r\nThis is a PR to add Intel MKL to Jenkins.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add mkl to ubuntu_cpu_mkldnn\r\n- [x] Add mkl to ubuntu_cpu\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @marcoabreu @TaoLv \r\n#13150

Description ##\r\nThis PR provides complimentary improvements for user to customize DataLoader in various use cases for optimal performance.\r\n \r\n- Now DataLoader supports `ThreadPool` version when shared memory is not prefered, or GIL is not a problem. Ref discussion in #13447\r\n- Support advanced configurations of threading management. Multiprocessing workers can use custom number of threads to process data rather than limited to 1. #13593 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-11T01:37:56Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T08:29:25Z","closed_at":"2018-12-14T18:16:33Z","merged_at":"2018-12-14T18:16:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"b9b038f9b06f8a88a15809840babeaa20f78bc2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":355414483,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTU0MTQ0ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Data-loading","name":"Data-loading","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nDuplicate of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13084. Created new PR as suspicious that CI is not linking dependency.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-10T23:15:17Z","updated_at":"2018-12-11T03:36:26Z","closed_at":"2018-12-11T03:36:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd947b47aee1bd5dd504ecf47a1fedea3ff38809","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1a78c121c71ac5dff5ad5baea7714b8e3a242482","head":{"label":"azai91:test/mkldnn-batch-norm-op-2","ref":"test/mkldnn-batch-norm-op-2","sha":"1a78c121c71ac5dff5ad5baea7714b8e3a242482","user":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109348168,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkzNDgxNjg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"azai91/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/azai91/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

case there are many cores(72 cores as in c5.18xl), doing import mxnet in multiple processes take very long time. Details here: #12255\r\n\r\nOne of the reason we have OMP tuning code which iterates to find OMP tune overhead. We are reducing this iteration count to reduce the overehead of tuning code.\r\nAlso, We added an environment variable where users can set the number of cores that should be used to determine tuning.\r\nReducing number of cores for tuning also helps in reduction of number of iterations.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully ran operator tuning unit test.(OMP_TUNING*)\r\nRan below test code on c5.18xl with 72 cores to see if the import mxnet is faster\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport os\r\nimport time\r\nimport multiprocessing\r\nfrom os import getpid\r\n\r\ndef mxnet_worker():\r\n    print(\"before import: pid:{}\".format(getpid()))\r\n    st_time = time.time()\r\n    import mxnet\r\n    end_time = time.time()\r\n    print(\"after import: pid:{} time:{}\".format(getpid(), end_time - st_time))\r\n\r\nread_process = [multiprocessing.Process(target=mxnet_worker) for i in range(30)]\r\nfrom threading import Thread\r\ni=0\r\n#while i<32:\r\n#    t1 = Thread(target=mxnet_worker)\r\n#    t1.start()\r\n#    i=i+1\r\nfor p in read_process:\r\n    p.daemon = True\r\n#    time.sleep(3)\r\n    p.start()\r\ntime.sleep(100000)\r\n\r\n```\r\nLoading 30 mxnet processes takes 41 seconds with no change in num_cores for tuning.\r\n\r\nIdeally num_cores should be 3\r\nWhen I run above code, after setting the environ variable export `MXNET_USE_NUM_CORES_OPERATOR_TUNING=3`\r\nthe 30 mxnet processes finishs loading in 2.2 seconds.\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

Description ##\r\nIn case there are many cores(72 cores as in c5.18xl), doing import mxnet in multiple processes take very long time. Details here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/12255\r\n\r\nOne of the reason we have OMP tuning code which iterates to find OMP tune overhead. We are reducing this iteration count to reduce the overehead of tuning code. \r\nAlso, We added an environment variable where users can set the number of cores that should be used to determine tuning.\r\nReducing number of cores for tuning also helps in reduction of number of iterations.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully ran operator tuning unit test.(OMP_TUNING*)\r\nRan below test code on c5.18xl with 72 cores to see if the import mxnet is faster\r\n```\r\nimport os\r\nimport time\r\nimport multiprocessing\r\nfrom os import getpid\r\n\r\ndef mxnet_worker():\r\n    print(\"before import: pid:{}\".format(getpid()))\r\n    st_time = time.time()\r\n    import mxnet\r\n    end_time = time.time()\r\n    print(\"after import: pid:{} time:{}\".format(getpid(), end_time - st_time))\r\n\r\nread_process = [multiprocessing.Process(target=mxnet_worker) for i in range(30)]\r\nfrom threading import Thread\r\ni=0\r\n#while i<32:\r\n#    t1 = Thread(target=mxnet_worker)\r\n#    t1.start()\r\n#    i=i+1\r\nfor p in read_process:\r\n    p.daemon = True\r\n#    time.sleep(3)\r\n    p.start()\r\ntime.sleep(100000)\r\n```\r\nLoading 30 mxnet processes takes 41 seconds with no change in num_cores for tuning.\r\n\r\nIdeally num_cores should be 3 \r\nWhen I run above code, after setting the environ variable  `export MXNET_USE_NUM_CORES_OPERATOR_TUNING=3 `\r\nthe 30 mxnet processes finishs loading in 2.2 seconds.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nCurrent `reshape` uses `_backward_copy` to do gradient calculation.\r\n\r\nBut `_backward_copy` sparse calculation requires same shapes of input and output - which is fair since sparsity is bind to # of rows and cols.\r\n\r\nAnd though `reshape` itself does not have sparse version, we can easily construct a network, in which its backward input and output are sparse - see test case.\r\n\r\nThus we need to provide a fallback version for `reshape` backward computation, so as `expand_dims`.\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin @zheng-da \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

(except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge,

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to address the error when excluding a quantization supported op in a model like the case below, where both `op1` and `op2` support quantization.  \r\n  ```op1 -> op2```\r\nWhen excluding `op1` from the model, the pattern is changed to\r\n   ```op1 -> _contrib_quantize -> quantized_op2```\r\nThere's an incorrect connection (incorrect entry index) between `_contrib_quantize` and `quantize_op2` for `min/max` inputs in current code base.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n@TaoLv @pengzhao-intel @apeforest

Description ##\r\n\r\n- This PR contains the port of Scala inference package to Clojure (Issue https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13384).\r\n- It ports the `Predictor`, `Classifier`, `ImageClassifier` and `ObjectDetector` APIs. \r\n- Docs, unit tests and examples still need to be added. I'll be doing these in the upcoming commits.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Clojure `infer` package, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Reviewers ##\r\n\r\n@gigasquid

Description ##\r\nWhen we sample a subgraph, a vertex is sampled in a certain layer. This operator is to find what vertices are sampled in different layers.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-09T01:56:03Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T12:01:27Z","closed_at":"2019-01-21T12:01:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd643e433ff026ce24232cc78dff946957be33cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe DGL csr neighbor sampling has many hashtable lookups. Hashtable lookups turn out to be expensive operations. This PR tries to accelerate sampling by reducing hashtable lookups.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-08T14:29:55Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T08:51:36Z","closed_at":"2018-12-19T08:51:36Z","merged_at":"2018-12-19T08:51:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"defa614d777efbffda69e39d3c998069e8bcfa3a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nI did hybridize( ) and pass \"valid_length\" to the unroll( ) function of BidirectionalCell, then returned AssertionError in line 79. Because symbol.split( ) return a symbol but not a symbol list. Result in the length of inputs is not equal to parameter \"length\"  when call unroll( )  to compute r_outputs and r_states. Symbol support for converting to list through list( ) API, so that use list( ) function insted of _as_list( ).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n### Essentials\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items

Description ##\r\nThis PR refactors ONNX import/export test code\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nCurrent directory structure:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9017059/49758683-7c807780-fc74-11e8-8800-1416fcbc9952.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRedundant code:\r\n\r\n1. test_case list - The same test case list (almost) is present in both export and import\r\n2. GluonBackendRep is available in import alone. This may become redundant when Gluon→ONNX export is added\r\n3. mxnet_backend_test, onnx_backend_test, gluon_backend_test all have the same set of loops\r\n4. mxnet_backend.py, backend.py - almost similar code\r\n5. mxnet_export_test, onnx_import_test - test_models is redundant, there is scope for combining operator tests.\r\n\r\nChanges that are part of cleanup:\r\n\r\n* Create tests/python-pytest/onnx/test_cases.py\r\n\r\n```\r\nIMPLEMENTED_OPERATORS_TEST = {'both' : [...], 'import': [...], 'export' : [...]}\r\nBASIC_MODEL_TESTS = {'both' : [...], 'import': [...], 'export' : [...]}\r\nSTANDARD_MODEL = {'both' : [...], 'import': [...], 'export' : [...]}\r\n```\r\n* Create onnx/mxnet_backend_test.py and onnx/gluon_backend_test.py for import/export with MXNet/Gluon backend respectively. These can't be combined further because the ONNX tests are added in globals() dictionary with test name as key. Combining these 2 will override the test list in globals().\r\n\r\n* Reference this newly created test_cases.py in mxnet_backend_test.py, onnx_backend_test.py, gluon_backend_test.py. Create a common onnx/backend_test.py for preparing the test list. \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef prepare_tests(backend, operation):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Prepare the test list\r\n    :param backend: mxnet/gluon

Description ##\r\n\r\nIt would be good to have runtime feature detection, for example to know if we were compiled with OPENCV, LAPACK, some tests fail when MXNet is not compiled with some feature or another.\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal for a runtime feature detection mechanism that would expose how the library was compiled and what features are available.\r\n\r\nIt also grooms some of the feature flags which were not uniformly set in base.h\r\n\r\n\r\nSee related discussion in dev:\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/19fe1da67551f9a199ec85dbb9c894e65c205d5fdd6764509e6e41ed@%3Cdev.mxnet.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-05T17:50:05Z","updated_at":"2019-01-23T11:32:33Z","closed_at":"2019-01-21T15:45:08Z","merged_at":"2019-01-21T15:45:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"692a24a0411e6d937bb46465f7eefd1e2df8be69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR updates the website build trigger sphinx-build with the `-W` switch. This turns on the \"warnings as errors\" feature in Sphinx.\r\n\r\n*edit*: This needs to be considered carefully as it may impact several people as they get used to the change. Also, the website build process exempts the old versions as they are still error-riddled. \r\nAre there any other exemptions needed before proceeding with this PR?\r\n\r\n## What This Means\r\nOnce merged, anyone that submits a PR that breaks the docs - particularly the Python docs - **their PR will fail CI**. \r\n\r\nIf you create a C operator that has docs strings that bubble up into the Python docs and break there, your PR will fail CI.\r\n\r\n## Testing Your Code Prior to a PR\r\nBut let's not fail in CI all of the time. You can test it out first.\r\n\r\n1. Turn off the doc sets you don't need to test in `docs/settings.ini`. Most of the time you just need to update the `[document_sets_default]` section. I tend to turn everything off for faster cycles on testing the build, then turn everything back on for a final test if my change messed with something that might trigger a Doxygen issue (C or C++ change) or Scala/Java docs issue (.scala or .java change).\r\n2. Run `make html USE_OPENMP=1 SPHINXOPTS=-W` from the docs folder. (or `make docs` with the same parameters from mxnet root)\r\nIf it fails, read the error and fix it. Once you get a successful build, you're ready to submit your PR.\r\n\r\nFor documentation help, check out the [documentation guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Documentation+Guide).\r\nFor details on building the website, check out [how to build the website](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/How+to+Build+the+Website)\r\n\r\n## Testing & CI Deployment\r\nI tested this with `./build_all_version.sh \"v1.4.x;master\" \"1.4.0;master\"`. The script will run the older version branch (that still has docs errors in it) and then runs master. Since the script only enables `-W` for master, it will show the warnings, but not stop the build when building the `v1.4.x` branch. When it eventually works on `master`, the `-W` flag is enabled, and if there are any Sphinx warnings it stops the build with an error.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Jenkins job for the website deployment builds master first. I could switch that to last, but actually, I think it is better that the job fails quickly if it is going to fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, please ask!","created_at":"2018-12-05T02:49:17Z","updated_at":"2018-12-18T17:02:03Z","closed_at":"2018-12-18T17:02:03Z","merged_at":"2018-12-18T17:02:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"67a9a814d0a0b5cbca11bd6377b3c5415e7e0c43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":707583550,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1ODM1NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Build","name":"Build","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-13542/1/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-05T01:05:36Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T18:35:28Z","closed_at":"2018-12-05T18:35:28Z","merged_at":"2018-12-05T18:35:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb0db290adcfd0fce956d02c234f81d453e41013","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13542/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13542/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13542/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/23980db198f1553af3d9b03dc995ed9c6fa7f5ed","head":{"label":"andrewfayres:doc_1.4.0","ref":"doc_1.4.0","sha":"23980db198f1553af3d9b03dc995ed9c6fa7f5ed","user":{"login":"andrewfayres","id":13068555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY4NTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13068555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewfayres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":131324578,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzEzMjQ1Nzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"andrewfayres/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewfayres","id":13068555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY4NTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13068555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewfayres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewfayres/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-04T21:28:47Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T00:01:26Z","closed_at":"2018-12-05T00:01:26Z","merged_at":"2018-12-05T00:01:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"f7192b238b8816a2c7733b208f85d4a5211eb9d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13536/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13536/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13536/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/2d8f3041eeb8ff8e48b7ccd807213345bf7c3132","head":{"label":"andrewfayres:doc_1.4.0","ref":"doc_1.4.0","sha":"2d8f3041eeb8ff8e48b7ccd807213345bf7c3132","user":{"login":"andrewfayres","id":13068555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY4NTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13068555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewfayres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":131324578,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzEzMjQ1Nzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"andrewfayres/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewfayres","id":13068555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY4NTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13068555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewfayres","followers_url"

fails which is expected.\r\n\r\nI think this is a bug in the compiler due to the temporary LogMessageFatal created on unwrapping the macro https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/c_lapack_api.h#L369 and too many inlined functions. The segfault is inside the ostream in libc, could be related to the lifetime of the temporary variable with a reference to the stream which is a very corner case of temporary variable lifetime.\r\n\r\nHaving the functions not inlined solves the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\nqemu@qemu:~/mxnet/build/tests$ ./mxnet_unit_tests --gtest_filter=\"inv_khatri_rao.OneInputMatrixTransposed\"\r\n\r\nNote: Google Test filter = inv_khatri_rao.OneInputMatrixTransposed\r\n[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.\r\n[----------] Global test environment set-up.\r\n[----------] 1 test from inv_khatri_rao\r\n[ RUN      ] inv_khatri_rao.OneInputMatrixTransposed\r\nunknown file: Failure\r\nC++ exception with description \"[13:27:04] /work/mxnet/src/operator/c_lapack_api.cc:42: MXNet build without lapack.

Description ##\r\nreplace https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13367\r\na follow up to add inception into nightly test after fix in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13284\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add cpp example test on inception\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-04T18:00:27Z","updated_at":"2018-12-08T03:57:55Z","closed_at":"2018-12-08T03:57:55Z","merged_at":"2018-12-08T03:57:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2ca66f2c537783aa60251080582793f42f395a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nThis PR aims to integrate MKLDNN Conv1d and enable 3d layout for Conv and Activation.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] MKLDNN Conv1d\r\n- [x] MKLDNN 3d layout for Conv and Activation\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv
