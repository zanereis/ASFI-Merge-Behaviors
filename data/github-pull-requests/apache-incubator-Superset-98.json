SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR leverages [a new FAB feature](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/pull/1629) to allow certain features to be enabled/disabled at runtime rather than once during boot. Routes will 404 if features are disabled, which is the same functionality present today. It also presents a consistent way to handle conditional route availability, giving us an opportunity to unify how this type of thing is handled.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces a new pattern for enabling/disabling feature flags per test using the `with_feature_flags` decorator. Example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass TestYourFeature(SupersetTestCase):\r\n\r\n    @with_feature_flags(YOUR_FEATURE=True)\r\n    def test_your_feature_enabled(self):\r\n        self.assertEqual(is_feature_enabled(\"YOUR_FEATURE\"), True)\r\n\r\n    @with_feature_flags(YOUR_FEATURE=False, ANOTHER_FEATURE=True)\r\n    def test_your_feature_disabled(self):\r\n        self.assertEqual(is_feature_enabled(\"YOUR_FEATURE\"), False)\r\n        self.assertEqual(is_feature_enabled(\"ANOTHER_FEATURE\"), True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nManual/unit/fab

SUMMARY\r\nAdds the generic datatype to the dataset column payload to avoid having to parse the raw datatypes in the frontend.

SUMMARY\r\nMany NVD3 timeseries viz' were featured duplicated sorting logic that was missing from others. This introduces sorting logic to the base `NVD3TimeSeriesViz` class removes the same from the following viz':\r\n- `NVD3TimeSeriesStackedViz` (=area chart)\r\n- `HorizonViz`\r\n- `RoseViz`\r\n- `PartitionViz`\r\n\r\nBy moving the sorting logic to the base class, this logic is now added to the following chart types that were previously missing it:\r\n- `NVD3TimeSeriesViz` (=line chart)\r\n- `NVD3TimeSeriesBarViz`\r\n- `NVD3CompareTimeSeriesViz`\r\n\r\nThe following charts that extend the `NVD3TimeSeriesViz` class are unaffected, since they don't feature the sorting control:\r\n- `NVD3TimePivotViz`\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nAll eight charts that this PR affects were manually tested to ensure that they work as expected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nPR #14485 cleaned up a bunch of LESS styles and moved them into Emotion. One style was also needed by the `SelectControl` component, and there was fallout from moving it away. This PR fixes it forward, putting the Emotion based styles where they're needed. \r\n\r\nI believe this is further indication that we need to standardize our Select components (there are several), to minimize these surprise regressions.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/117526181-472d0080-af78-11eb-8b32-95d5b99249e5.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/117525183-dedd1f80-af75-11eb-9c52-564f927b0071.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nPick any viz with a `group by` control - e.g. the Table viz.

SUMMARY\r\nI have created a new dynamic error-bound input. When the user interacts with this form, if an error occurs - designated by a function passed into the `validationMethods` parameter - the error will replace any existing helper text until the error is resolved. `<LabeledErrorBoundInput />` accepts the following parameters in order to customize the input:\r\n```label?: string;\r\n  name: string;\r\n  validationMethods:\r\n    | { onBlur: (value: any) => void }\r\n    | { onChange: (value: any) => void };\r\n  errorMessage: string | null;\r\n  helpText?: string;\r\n  value: string | number | readonly string[] | undefined;\r\n  required?: boolean;\r\n  placeholder?: string;\r\n  autocomplete?: string;\r\n  type?: string;\r\n  id?: string;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFixes an issue where Explore control panels with long label text cause funky line-wrapping on mouseover. This was due to the `span` containing the tooltip(s) appearing inline, and getting to wide. This PR makes the tooltips absolutely positioned, so that they can't cause a line wrap. They might hang a little too far over to the right, but it's an improvement.\r\n\r\nAs bycatch, this moves a bunch of CSS from LESS files to the component itself, using Emotion and theme variables.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nURL params are currently not being picked up correctly on native filters or CSV export. This PR does the following:\r\n- Add `url_param` to the native filter `formData` payload\r\n- Move the `extractUrlParams` util from the dashboard hydration reducer to a separate util + add tests\r\n- Add handling for form-based v1 chart data requests to `get_form_data()` on the backend + add tests\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nNative filters don't pick up the url param despite a table chart referencing the same column shows the value correctly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/117470326-594e7500-af5f-11eb-9c91-a2fc3ec28e84.png)\r\nSame on native filter config default value

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis adds Docker and `docker-compose` support for the websocket server.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nSince we support development both with and without Docker, we need to make sure that any `node_modules` and `dist` folders/files from the host machine are not copied into the container, those should be freshly installed/compiled. `.dockerignore` ensures that `COPY` commands in the Dockerfile will not carry those folders over when building the image with `docker build`. However, this did not seem to work when running the service with `docker-compose`. Instead, it works to mount fake volumes for those folders in the compose file. Since the compose file is for development, I think it's ok to go with this somewhat hacky solution (it seems to work fine).\r\n\r\n### Try it out\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to run superset via docker with async queries via websockets, you can:\r\n\r\n1. Ensure you properly configure async queries (and whatever else) in `docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config_docker.py`\r\n2. Boot relevant superset services with docker-compose, e.g.,\r\n    ```\r\n     docker-compose up superset superset-websocket superset-worker\r\n    ```\r\n\r\ncc @robdiciuccio

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a follow-up of #12093 , which aims to automatically hide/expand the time section based on presence of temporal columns in the dataset.\r\n\r\nPreviously the `ControlPanelsContainer` component was using the `defaultActiveKey` prop in `Collapse` to control which panels were active. To be able to make the panels collapse automatically when we change datasources to one with/without temporal columns, we have to switch to `activeKey` and manage the state within the component. To do this some code had to be moved out of the render method, but the majority of the logic is untouched.\r\n\r\nPrevious flow:\r\n- Time section is always expanded by default, but possible to collapse/expand manually\r\n- Changing to a datasource without any temporal columns did not collapse the time section.\r\n\r\nNew flow:\r\n- By default the time section opens up in a collapsed state if there is no temporal column in the dataset\r\n- Time section can still be manually expanded/collapsed manually like before\r\n- By changing to a dataset with (without) at least one temporal column will cause the time section to expand (collapse) the time section.\r\n- When changing viz type, the time section will be automatically expanded/collapsed based on the logic described above\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nPreviously the time section was always expanded, and changing the dataset to/from one with/without any temporal columns didn't change anything:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/117162820-ca5d2380-adcb-11eb-923d-d1281668f5a0.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the time section is automatically expanded/collapsed when changing to a dataset with/without a temporal column.\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/117162867-d2b55e80-adcb-11eb-9dae-3f26fcaf9e45.mp4\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR moves some styles from `src/explore/main.less` to Emotion. Also, removes `.less` stylesheet in native filters - all the styles that we need are in the components.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nManually verify that everything looks as before on explore view and in native filters modal (with 1-2px accuracy caused by using `theme.gridUnit` - for example, 30px margins became `theme.gridUnit * 7`, which equals 28px).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently force refreshing a chart will always return cached results for annotations in the legacy timeseries charts. This PR force refreshes the annotation data when calling the legacy annotation endpoint with `force=true`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nIn this example an annotation range was cached with the range 2000-2005, and updated to 1995-2000. Force refreshing does nothing:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/117115243-86e7c280-ad95-11eb-9a3e-cd2b044f515a.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nWith this PR, the annotation data is

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFlex layout in the explore section _usually_ looks OK, but when things are in an error state, and all three columns are shorter than the viewport, that means the whole _layout_ can get too short, making a weird gap under the menu. This sets a `flex-basis` property that's *plenty* tall (the entire viewport) to take up the space, and then flexbox will shrink things as needed.\r\n\r\nIssue reported by @srinify\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nSelect a dataset without too many fields (so the list is short)\r\nFind a viz with a sufficiently short control panel (either tab in the control panel, as seen in the gifs above)\r\nPut the chart in an error state so it loses its height.\r\nWitness the layout shift at the top (or... hopefully not).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nI'd like to log requests to the /datasource/save endpoint so that we know when users alter a datasource. \r\n\r\n(Edit: I was previously concerned about logging large data blobs in the json field but the size of this seems in line with other large payloads we are logging like /save_dash, the database like mysql will truncate large blobs). The data that automatically gets logged in the `json` column can be large (it includes all of the data for the datasource that is getting saved so if the datasource has a lot of columns they will all get logged). \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nEdited a datasource from the `/tablemodelview/list/` and explore pages, confirmed logs in the logs table.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow

SUMMARY\r\nIgnore database extra fields when saving. This is a fix for a regression that prevented the saving of databases or the creation of new ones. The client is sending more data than it should, and this fix ignores this extra data for now. We should definitely fix the client side to send only the necessary information to the API.\r\n\r\n@eschutho I know that you are working on this modal. Can you make this modification?

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds the functionality of calling databases/available api to get a list of databases that have drivers loaded and available to use. The form is built dynamically based on that information. This is currently behind a local flag, and there are no visual changes, but the piece in development is as shown below. More work is needed to hook the form up to the api on connect/save, but I'm merging often to reduce any rebasing issues and also keep PRs small.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThis is behind a local flag `useSqlAlchemyForm` which is set to 'false'\r\n<img width=\"529\" alt=\"_DEV__Superset\"

SUMMARY\r\nAllow CSV upload form to accept parquet file. Went in this direction so as not to exacerbate what was brought up in #13834 by adding a new form specifically for parquet files.
