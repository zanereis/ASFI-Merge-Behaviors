PR also refers to NIFI-3632, NIFI-5329 and NIFI-4308.\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\nReplaced the current \"Empty queue\" button in the context menu with an \"Empty queues\" sub-menu providing different options to empty multiple queues at different levels of the flow depending on the selected components.\r\n\r\nIn particular, different buttons have been added to the new \"Empty queues\" sub-menu:\r\n- selected queue: empty the selected queue\r\n- selected queues: empty the selected queues\r\n- current process group: empty all queues inside the current process group\r\n- current process group (recursive): empty all queues inside the current process group recursively, which means all queues inside the current process group, and its sub process groups, and their sub process groups [and so on] will be emptied\r\n- selected process group: empty all queues inside the selected process group\r\n- selected process group (recursive): empty all queues inside the selected process group recursively\r\n- selected process groups: empty all queues inside the selected process groups\r\n- selected process groups (recursive): empty all queues inside the selected process groups recursively\r\n\r\n**Errors management**: if the emptying process fails to empty one or more queues, it keeps going till all the selected queues are processed. After that, the final summary dialog eventually provides information about the errors faced in emptying one or more queues.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\n```\r\nCurrently NiFi has lots of metrics available for areas including jvm and flow component usage (via component status) as well as provenance data which NiFi makes available either through the UI or reporting tasks (for consumption by other systems). Past discussions in the community cite users shipping this data to applications such as Prometheus, ELK stacks, or Ambari metrics for further analysis in order to capture/review performance issues, detect anomalies, and send alerts or notifications. These systems are efficient in capturing and helping to analyze these metrics however it requires customization work and knowledge of NiFi operations to provide meaningful analytics within a flow context.\r\n\r\nIn speaking with Matt Burgess and Andy Christianson on this topic we feel that there is an opportunity to introduce an analytics framework that could provide users reasonable predictions on key performance indicators for flows, such as back pressure and flow rate, to help administrators improve operational management of NiFi clusters. This framework could offer several key features:\r\n\r\n- Provide a flexible internal analytics engine and model api which supports the addition of or enhancement to onboard models\r\n- Support integration of remote or cloud based ML models\r\n- Support both traditional and online (incremental) learning methods\r\n- Provide support for model caching (perhaps later inclusion into a model repository or registry)\r\n- UI enhancements to display prediction information either in existing summary data, new data visualizations, or directly within the flow/canvas (where applicable)\r\n\r\nFor an initial target we thought that back pressure prediction would be a good starting point for this initiative, given that back pressure detection is a key indicator of flow performance and many of the metrics currently available would provide enough data points to create a reasonable performing model. We have some ideas on how this could be achieved however we wanted to discuss this more with the community to get thoughts about tackling this work, especially if there are specific use cases or other factors that should be considered\r\n\r\nThis closes NIFI-6510.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPR Testing and Validation Notes:\r\n\r\nWhen analytics is enabled (via nifi.analytics.predict.enabled in nifi.properties), back pressure predictions should appear as part of the connection/queue tool tip.  It should include two predictions:\r\n\r\n- Predicted Queue size in the next interval (interval as configured by nifi.analytics.predict.interval in nifi.properties)\r\n- Estimated time until back pressure is encountered\r\n\r\nThese predictions are available in the context of queue object count and queue content size.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-03 at 2 57 11 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1371858/64202472-3b15a500-ce5f-11e9-8776-79deba0cb1fd.png)\r\n\r\nValues can also be viewed in the NiFi Summary:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-03 at 3 09 17 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1371858/64202488-4537a380-ce5f-11e9-8675-2814f299793f.png)\r\n\r\nWith default settings, predictions will take about 2-3 minutes to appear since snapshots are only taken once per minute.  The administration guide in this PR provides more information on how this and other properties can be configured to adjust this if needed.\r\n\r\nSuggested tests include:\r\n\r\n- Enable/Disable Feature\r\n- Increase Decreasing time intervals\r\n- Prediction Assessment - Confirming if prediction provided is reasonable? E.g. are you seeing back pressure being experienced at or near predicted times\r\n- Filling and quickly emptying queues - This should causes predictions to temporarily halt as model becomes less reliable (due to sharp change in samples causing high variance)\r\n- Changing score thresholds - Higher scores threshold means NiFi can only use models with less error, yet this may be difficult to obtain given samples so predictions may be less available.  Lower scores mean NiFi may provide more predictions yet ttey would be higher level of error\r\n- Invalid values for properties (e.g. invalid model implementation)\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Allow PutParquet processor to specify avro write configuration\r\n\r\nThis PR adds ParquetReader and ParquetRecordSetWriter, and also added some additional configuration to the PutParquet processor that was also needed in the record writer.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement the ParquetReader, the Parquet API requires knowledge of the inputLength ahead of time, which currently wasn't available to the RecordReaderFactory method that didn't have a FlowFile passed in. \r\n\r\nTo work around this I added an optional `long inputLength` parameter to that method and updated all the corresponding places in our code where it is called. The only place where we really don't know the input length is when reading from an unbound stream like

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n- Write peers into managed-state, instead of local file\r\n- Now, the local file location constants and its property key are no longer needed\r\n- Confirmed that state is written\r\n- Implemented recovering peers from the stored state\r\n- Tested storing/recovering using a local file\r\n- Tested with a cluster where the bootstrap node (specified at the RPG) is not reachable, but the one of stored peer is still alive. In that case, NiFi will restore remote peer information from managed state when it restarted, then RPG should be able to transfer FlowFiles with the remaining nodes. Confirmed this scenario works as expected.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-28T01:17:57Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T13:56:56Z","closed_at":"2019-10-01T13:56:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"620f07010470e08d3002252940fbf0aebed0f19c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3677/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3677/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3677/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/cc7da3c58e996dfbe5cb930afda3dde19e54da19","head":{"label":"ijokarumawak:nifi-6598","ref":"nifi-6598","sha":"cc7da3c58e996dfbe5cb930afda3dde19e54da19","user":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43044682,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzA0NDY4Mg==","name":"nifi","full_name":"ijokarumawak/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ijokarumawak","id":1107620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak","html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijokarumawak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ijokarumawak/nifi","description":"Mirror

fixes an issue reported through the Parquet processors, but was really a general problem when reading records with a field that used the \"fixed\" type and a logicalType of decimal. Our type util code was missing the check for the logicalType and just converting to byte array.\r\n\r\nI added a unit test to FetchParquet to prove that it is resolved, although there are no code changes to the Parquert bundle itself. \r\n\r\nAlso noticed that unit tests were failing to initialize logging correctly due to finding multiple SLF4J bindings, so this PR includes a small change to enforce that logback-core is marked as provided which allows tests to use the slf4j-simple module which is already on the test classpath of all NARs.","created_at":"2019-08-22T17:07:17Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T01:58:06Z","closed_at":"2019-08-26T01:58:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd91537e2c4b110acde7999229b351fac1f48721","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3665/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3665/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3665/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/df19c375ed276d673f317beb37a0fecb9f5e2d0b","head":{"label":"bbende:NIFI-6158","ref":"NIFI-6158","sha":"df19c375ed276d673f317beb37a0fecb9f5e2d0b","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48186740,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODE4Njc0MA==","name":"nifi","full_name":"bbende/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbende/nifi","description":"Mirror

Description of PR\r\n\r\n*  `EncryptContent` accepts a new optional property: `PGP Symmetric Encryption Cipher`\r\n*  When selecting `PGP` or `PGP-ASCII-ARMOR` as algorithms, it is possible to select among the different supported ciphers\r\n   *  This new property approach has been selected (instead of enlarging the amount of supported `Encryption Algorithm` property possible values) for compatibility with the previous version\r\n   *  The default value of this new property is `AES_128`, which maintains the original behavior if untouched after the update\r\n*  `SAFER` algorithm has been left out of the support because it throws `ClassNotFoundException` inside Bouncy Castle implementation\r\n*  Tests has been updated in order to perform a check with every possible cipher In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-21T10:44:50Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T18:02:07Z","closed_at":"2019-09-03T18:00:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b23721624e7aad0edb67e737b539697ff66a4827","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/4fcc2464a323653b95f652d12400912296d9a0cf","head":{"label":"adarmiento:NIFI-6536","ref":"NIFI-6536","sha":"4fcc2464a323653b95f652d12400912296d9a0cf","user":{"login":"adarmiento","id":13642937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQyOTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13642937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento","html_url":"https://github.com/adarmiento","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197920356,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTc5MjAzNTY=","name":"nifi","full_name":"adarmiento/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adarmiento","id":13642937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQyOTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13642937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento","html_url":"https://github.com/adarmiento","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adarmiento/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adarmiento/nifi","description":"Mirror

object. Also allow configurable model from nifi.properties\r\n\r\nThis change supports the user's ability to choose and configure the model used by ConnectionStatusAnalytics object via nifi.properties.  The following properties have been added:\r\n\r\nnifi.analytics.connection.model.implementation - This property indicates StatusAnalyticsModel implementation that will be used for connection prediction . \r\n By default this value is org.apache.nifi.controller.status.analytics.models.OrdinaryLeastSquare. \r\n\r\nnifi.analytics.connection.model.score.name - Designates the scoring name that should be used when evaluating the validity/accuracy of the model.  By default this is rSquared. If score value is not available the framework will not be able to make a prediction.\r\n\r\nnifi.analytics.connecttion.model.score.threshold - The threshold that should be exceeded in order to use the model.  By default this value is .9, however accepted values should range from -1 to 1 (acceptable models should really be greater than 0).\r\n\r\nOther possible values for the model implementation are org.apache.nifi.controller.status.analytics.models.SimpleRegression (this uses rSquared for scoring). When configuring higher threshold values models will be more selective in it's ability to predict, lower thresholds may offer more prediction yet with less accuracy.\r\n\r\nAll models configured would use same feature set currently (time and output/input ratio) however this could be an area made flexible in a future PR to indicate a ExtractionFunction implementation for a given model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNIFI-6566 - changes to allow scoring configurations for model in nifi.properties\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nIt is possible to start the TLS toolkit in server mode with a token length below the required 16 bits. But when the client is performing the request, it'll be denied with the message \"Token does not meet minimum size of 16 bytes\". This PR is about preventing the TLS toolkit to start in server mode when the token is below 16 bytes.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you to ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Files are Missing\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\nWhen NiFi is journaling the FlowFile repository changes to disk it sometimes writes Overflow files if it exceeds a certain memory threshold.\r\n\r\nThese files are tracked inside of the *.journal files as External File References. If one of these external file references is deleted or lost the entire journal fails to recover.\r\n\r\nInstead, I feel this should work more like FlowFile's that lose their queue, or Content in the Content Repository that has lost it's FlowFile.  Log it, and move on.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nnifi-stateless currently supports running a flow from a registry given a flow_id and a registry endpoint.  To facilitate environments where there is no connectivity to a registry, I would like the ability to run nifi-stateless from a flow.xml.gz on the filesystem.  When running in a container the flow.xml.gz could be added to the container image and tagged with a version, or mounted as a volume at runtime.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n> yes, but having trouble getting the test to pass locally. I think the problem is related to the narLoader in nifi-stateless but I could use some help debugging. Everything works as expected when run from the nifi-stateless docker image\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

stages to cache dependencies before build and test\r\nAdded --fail-never to dependency cache stage to allow dependency:go-offline to finish and update the cache with any dependencies that were able to be downloaded\r\nAdded download of AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.4 for the Java 11 build\r\nRemoved setting environment variables to enable easier sharing of cache between build, region/language settings are passed in via the command line when invoking maven\r\nFormatted scripts to allow multiline commands for more readability\r\nReplaced \"exit ${PIPESTATUS[0]}\" with \"test ${PIPESTATUS[0]} -eq 0\" to avoid using \"exit\" in script, which prevents Travis from completing the cache upload after the build completes\r\nInstall Maven 3.6.1 for the -ntp (no-transfer-progress) feature\r\nUpdated all build stages to exclude non-api nar and assembly modules to decrease build time\r\nDependency cache stages check if the cached maven repository doesn't exist or is empty before attempting to download dependencies\r\n```\r\n----\r\nTo verify this PR, Travis should have a completed build, with two stages executed to download and cache dependencies for openjdk8 and non-explicit-jdk Cache stages, and four stages for the various locale and JDK version builds.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the four stages which build and test the code exclude assembly and -nar modules to decrease build time, so that all stages can finish in less than 50 minutes.\r\n\r\n----\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nProvides a FlowFile Repository implementation which makes use of the RocksDB key-value store.  It uses periodic syncronization to ensure that no created or received data is lost (as long as `nifi.flowfile.repository.rocksdb.accept.data.loss` is set `false`).  In the event of power loss, _work_ done on FlowFiles through the system (i.e. routing and transformation) may still be lost.  Specifically, the record of these actions may be lost, reverting the affected FlowFiles to a previous, valid state.  From there, they will resume their path through the flow as normal.  This guarantee comes at the expense of a delay on operations that add new data to the system.  This delay is configurable (as `nifi.flowfile.repository.rocksdb.sync.period`), and can be tuned to the individual system.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?  \r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\n- The following `MergeContent` attributes now accept expression language\r\n\r\n-- `Correlation Attribute Name`: Accepts both from Variable Registry and Flowfile Attributes (just like `MergeContent`)\r\n-- `Minimum Bin Size`: Accepts from Variable Registry\r\n-- `Maximum Bin Size`: Accepts from Variable Registry\r\n-- `Max Bin Age`: Accepts from Variable Registry\r\n-- `Maximum Number of Bins`: Accepts from Variable Registry\r\n\r\n- `TestMergeContent` has been a little reorganized in order to have tests which validate the same component to be into the same method

Description of PR\r\nIn the Connection Configuration UI, the relationship name list is formatted by calling the `ellipsis` jQuery plugin, but does not work because of a CSS style being applied to the list.\r\n\r\nThis causes long relationship names to be cut off abruptly instead of having the `ellipsis` applied.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nExpression Language now supports padding functions:\r\n- padLeft:\r\n  -  attr:padLeft(Int n, String s) will prepend to the `attr` attributes the `s` string until the size `n` is reached\r\n  -  attr:padLeft(Int n) will prepend to the `attr` attributes the `'_'` character until the size `n` is reached\r\n- padRight:\r\n  -  attr:padRight(Int n, String s) will append to the `attr` attributes the `s` string until the size `n` is reached\r\n  -  attr:padRight(Int n) will append to the `attr` attributes the `'_'` character until the size `n` is reached\r\n\r\n- In both cases, the padding function returns the `attr` `String` as is if its length is already equal or higher than the desired size `n`\r\n- Returns null if `attr` does not exist\r\n- Returns the input string untouched if `n` is null or overflowing\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n## Changes ##\r\n\r\n- `PadLeft(String label, int desiredLength, char paddingChar)` prepends the `paddingChar` (or the default value `'_'` if a `paddingChar` is not provided) to the `label` `string` until `desiredLength` is reached.\r\n- `PadRight(String label, int desiredLength, char paddingChar)` appends the `paddingChar` (or the default value `'_'` if a `paddingChar` is not provided) to the `label` `string` until `desiredLength` is reached.\r\n- In both cases, if the input `String` length is already equal or bigger than `desiredLength`, nothing is performed\r\n\r\n## Examples ##\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\" : \"john smith\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`padLeft(/name, 15, '@')` => `@@@@@john smith`\r\n`padLeft(/name, 15)` =>  `_____john smith`\r\n`padRight(/name, 15, '@')` => `john smith@@@@@`\r\n`padRight(/name, 15)`=> `john smith_____`\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket
