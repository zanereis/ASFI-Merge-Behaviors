describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Description\r\nThis PR aims to deprecate usage of config-magic (`ConfigProvider`) in favor of using `JsonConfigProvider` everywhere. In the process I have made the config paths a bit more sane (one of the reasons to replace `ConfigProvider` is because of how easily devs can make paths that don't make much structural sense due to the free-form nature of how config paths are defined).\r\n\r\nThe main users are `DruidProcessingConfig` and `DruidCoordinatorConfig`, the former of which has been reworked to be simple jackson annotated objects which are injected with a fallback to support legacy config-magic paths as needed. After these changes are released, we can consider finally deleting config-magic in a future release.\r\n\r\nFor `DruidProcessingConfig`, the structure was mostly ok, but I have flattened the broker parallel merge config into just living at `druid.processing.merge` (i guess we could change this, i don't feel very strongly), and split it into a totally separate config from the rest of `DruidProcessingConfig` since it is only used by brokers for `CachingClusteredClient`.\r\n\r\nFor `DruidCoordinatorConfig` WIP (i haven't done anything to it yet, but it definitely needs reworked...)\r\n\r\n`MonitorSchedulerConfig` was also using config-magic annotations, but was no longer using `ConfigProvider` and so seemed unnecessary so I have just flattened it into `DruidMonitorSchedulerConfig` which has moved to druid-processing, because it was already wired up to `JsonConfigProvider`.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nBroker parallel merge config options at paths `druid.processing.merge.pool.*` and `druid.processing.merge.task.*` have been flattened to use the `druid.processing.merge` prefix. Note that the legacy paths will still function, but will issue a warning log noting that these configs have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release, along with the new paths which should be used to continue configuring these values.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nFixes an issue that can occur when using `NestedFieldVirtualColumn` with a string typed output to select array elements of numeric typed arrays. The column type of the virtual column will report as `STRING` because it was specified as the type hint, but the array itself is numeric, which should not use a vector object selector. When used with a filter, the column processor will make a string matcher, but have an object selector full of numbers, resulting in class cast exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe underlying nested column was also missing the ability to get the column types for array columns when an element was specified. I have added it, translating the array types into the element types in the resulting set returned from the method.\r\n\r\nThe added test covers this case, and also removed some comments which were accidentally copied to all of the tests that were not accurate and only supposed to be on one of the tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nRemoves a sanity check in the stage definition, which seems incorrect due to the following reason: The stage might be shuffling for `GlobalSortMaxCountShuffleSpec`, if the `maxPartitions` > 1, however we only consider the size of the clusterBy in the sanity check. Therefore for a `GlobalSortMaxCountShuffleSpec` with empty clusterBy and `maxPartitions` > 1, we do want shuffling, however the sanity check prevents it. This same logic would also apply in `GlobalSortTargetSizeShuffleSpec` with `clusterBy` empty.\r\n\r\nThis manifests itself when trying to run queries of form being solved by the PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14522, with multiple worker tasks (>1)\r\n\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO foo1 \r\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('DAY', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1'DAY) AS __time, SUM(m1) AS sum_m1\r\nFROM foo\r\nPARTITIONED BY DAY\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~However, it wasn't caught in the original PR since the unit tests of MSQ are limited to single worker process.\r\nDue to the limitation, unit tests have been omitted from the current PR as well.~~\r\nI am able to reproduce the issue by setting maxTasks in the query context of UT, therefore updating the PR with a UT. (This multi worker tests in MSQ's test suite is currently not fully supported, however it works for this test case as well) \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `StageDefinition`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

We found that s3 extension is loading S3 required jars and instantiating the PropertyNamingStrategies from newer jackson and failing. \r\nCreating the PR to pull this class into druid repo itself to fix the hadoop ingestion and make it compatible with newer jackson. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `maxSegments` configured for auto kill could be ignored if an interval of data for a  given datasource had more than this number of unused segments, causing the kill task spawned with the task of deleting unused segments in that given interval of data to delete more than the `maxSegments` configured. Now each kill task spawned by the auto kill coordinator duty, will kill at most `limit` segments. This is done by adding a new config property to the `KillUnusedSegmentTask` which allows users to specify this limit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the storage connector to interact with Azure's blob storage using the current Azure API used in Druid. This will allow Durable storage and MSQ's interactive APIs to work with Azure\r\n\r\nThis also refactors the currently available S3 connector so that the chunking downloads that is currently done by the S3 connector can be extended to other connectors. (note: This refactoring is ported from the PR https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14611 since that is currently parked for work). \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Testing plan\r\n1. Adding unit tests to the Azure connector \r\n2. Functionally testing that the Azure connector works as expected. \r\n3. Sanity testing that the S3 connector works as expected since it has been refactored\r\n4. Performance comparison between the Azure connector (new feature) and the S3 connector (current benchmark)\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nAzure connector has been introduced and MSQ's fault tolerance and durable storage can now be used with Microsoft Azure's blob storage. Also the results of newly introduced queries from deep storage can now store and fetch the results from the Azure's blob storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the ability to add a cluster name as a Prometheus label. This is particularly useful when managing multiple Druid clusters and needing to distinguish between the metrics they emit.\r\n\r\nThis was achieved by adding a new optional configuration parameter (`druid.emitter.prometheus.clusterName`) to the Prometheus emitter.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n- Added a new configuration parameter (`druid.emitter.prometheus.clusterName`) to the Prometheus emitter.\r\n- Modified the PrometheusEmitter to include the cluster name as a Prometheus label if the configuration parameter is set.\r\n- Modified the unit tests to include and test this new functionality.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nThe Prometheus emitter now supports an additional optional configuration parameter, `druid.emitter.prometheus.clusterName`. This allows users to add a cluster name as a Prometheus label to distinguish between multiple Druid clusters.\r\n<hr>\r\nKey changed/added classes in this PR:\r\n- PrometheusEmitter\r\n- PrometheusEmitterConfig\r\n- PrometheusEmitterTest\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nFixes some bugs with the new equality and range filters when matching double typed values (and arrays) to long typed columns (and arrays). These filters specify a match value type, which is used to help coerce values to the underlying input type, typically by casting them. This is important because we want to ideally change the match value to the native input type so that we don't instead have to cast every row value we want to match into the match value type. However, for matching double values to long inputs, this can lead to precision loss from the type narrowing, resulting in problems such as `1L` matching `1.1` since the latter becomes `1` when cast to a long. A similar problem happens with range filters. We still want to allow something like `1.0` to match `1L`, since they are equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe solution, is to check if this narrowing violates equality, and:\r\n* for equality filters, spit out an 'all false' result\r\n* for range filters, take the ceiling of the double value if the lower bound is closed, or floor if open, and the floor of the double value if the upper bound is closed, or ceiling if open\r\n\r\nThis corrects the behavior, making matchers behave as expected. \r\n\r\nI also fixed an issue with 'auto' typed numeric columns, which were incorrectly reporting themselves as dictionary encoded in the `ColumnCapabilities`, which .. they are actually dictionary encoded, however they do not implement `DictionaryEncodedColumn`, which causes some class cast exceptions in places which expect that all columns which make the claim on their capabilities can produce dimension selectors, and these columns currently can not.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

adds support for string arrays that are themselves null, i.e. `null`. This stands in contrast to arrays containing a single null `[null]` and empty arrays `[]`, both of which were already supported.\r\n\r\nThe row format represents null arrays as `0x0001`, which, fortuitously, older readers would interpret as an empty array. This provides compatibility with older readers, which is useful during updates.\r\n\r\nThe column format represents null arrays by writing `-(actual length) - 1` instead of the length, and uses `FrameColumnWriters.TYPE_STRING_ARRAY` for the type code for string arrays generally. Older readers will report this as an unrecognized type code. Column format is only used by the operator query, which is currently experimental, so the impact isn't too severe.","created_at":"2023-07-25T07:23:24Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:52:19Z","closed_at":"2023-07-28T17:23:39Z","merged_at":"2023-07-28T17:23:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"46ecc6b9001f84e9affcb6153af0fbc3b55c324b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4418928415,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAGEErM8AAAABB2N_Hw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20MSQ","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis is a performance optimization for the KubernetesTaskRunner. For larger numbers of tasks (especially if they are streaming), there are a lot of getTaskLocation calls on the task runner (e.g. supervisors make this call periodically). Currenly the K8s task runner has to find the pod by querying k8s and grab the pod IP even though it doesn't change unless the pod dies (in which case the task would have already failed).\r\n\r\nI have tried testing this with on the order of 200 supervisor tasks and the druid console starts getting really slow. After this change I am able to go up to at least 1000 tasks without an issue on the overlord (haven't tried more than this).\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nPerformance optimization for k8s task runner.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* KubernetesPeonLifecycle\r\n\r\nI considered adding a watcher on the pod instead to be safe but I think that would also cause issues, we can revisit that in the future if we decide we need it.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

thread thus caused race condition as shown in the following code:\r\n```\r\nreturn tasks.computeIfAbsent(\r\n        task.getId(), k -> new KubernetesWorkItem(task, exec.submit(() -> runTask(task)))\r\n    ).getResult();\r\n```\r\nIn this PR we changed the KubernetesWorkItem constructor to allow TaskStatusFuture set by a method after the instance has been initialized.\r\n\r\n####

to #14131, #14634, and #14639.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSplit the KillUnusedSegmentsTask to process in smaller batches. The segment nuke runs inside a critical section inside the `TaskLockbox`. This blocks up most activity in the overlord, including allocation of new segments, while the nuke is running. If the nuke runs for a long time, it can cause issues with cluster stability.\r\n\r\nThis change relieves pressure on the `TaskLockbox` by splitting the nuke work into smaller chunks, which will allow other tasks to interleave with the lockbox.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n- `KillUnusedSegmentsTask`: partition the segments into batches of size 10000 for nuke.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n### Release notes\r\n\r\nA new optional parameter has been introduced to the kill task description, which allows to perform the kill in batches (vs all at once). This should allow better stability to issue larger and longer running tasks.","created_at":"2023-07-23T20:09:03Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:52:05Z","closed_at":"2023-07-31T19:56:27Z","merged_at":"2023-07-31T19:56:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"44d5c1a15f1a00837812393e2485c14645f06984","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

to #14634.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIntroduce batching to mitigate some scaling challenges while managing lots of segments.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changes to `IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinator` to use the JDBI PreparedBatch instead of issuing single update statements inside a transaction.\r\n\r\nContext - in our environment, bulk cleanup of old segments (O(thousands)) stalls the overlord, because the overlord is issuing delete statements. These delete statements are done while holding the TaskLockbox lock, which is done from the TaskQueue, so the whole overlord locks up until the delete statements are complete. By pushing these into a single bulk transaction we see a meaningful improvement: previously ~1000 rows/sec removed, after ~1800 rows/sec removed.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n

from [#14599](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14599).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nExtends [instructions of MM-less `druid-overlord-extension`](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/extensions-contrib/k8s-jobs.html). I've changed wording in docs of `druid.indexer.runner.peonMonitors` option, since it doesn't override Overlord's `druid.monitoring.monitors` but rather it overrides peon pod's `druid_monitoring_monitors` environment variable.\r\nFor this to work properly I use a workaround described in _Gotchas_ section, where I use `druid_monitoring_monitors` variable in definition of Overlord monitors. \r\n\r\nPossible improvement would be to avoid using `druid_monitoring_monitors` env variable and directly override `runtime.properties` that peon pod's would use. But I'm not proficient enough in java, so I'm not sure if that's possible to be implemented.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is best wording and if this workaround is good enough, but this at least clears ambiguous description that resulted in breaking errors.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nThe goal is to create a set of notebooks that walk users through all aspects of batch and streaming ingestion.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nThis PR includes the index for the ingestion folder and the batch ingestion notebook which describes many aspects of SQL based ingestion with runnable examples.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Added an index for the set of ingestion notebooks\r\n#### Added the first notebook in the set: batch ingestion \r\n#### Adjusted the environment file to use less memory in Peon JVMs because it was failing in some ingestion scenarios\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

a UX bug with typing filters where the filter inputs get a bit too many updates causing the cursor to jump to the end (or sometimes missing letters if you type fast enough.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1191\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/177816/566ed08c-ee1f-481c-b6fb-9c2b391fd614\">\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to see a manifestation of the bug is try to type in the middle of the text, the bug will put the cursor at the end.\r\n\r\n### The detailed issue (for those who care)\r\n\r\nSay `\"ka\"` is already typed and the user adds an `f`. The on change will be called with `\"kaf\"` but the table will re-render also rendering the input once with the old value of `\"ka\"` reseting the cursor at the end before the URL is updated and parsed as `\"kaf\"`.\r\n\r\n### The solution\r\n\r\nThe source of truth for the input box will now be the local state `focusedText` for the entire time the input is in focus. This means that no update thrashing will bubble up to the user while they are focused on the input. When focus is lost (onBlur) the text in the input will 'revert' to the state from the URL which should be the same as what was entered.","created_at":"2023-07-20T22:29:01Z","updated_at":"2023-07-20T23:24:17Z","closed_at":"2023-07-20T23:22:42Z","merged_at":"2023-07-20T23:22:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"295653648b2962c9b71f78880927621b507e84f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area

a issue where having data source names (or more generally task ids) that are too long cause the K8sTaskRunner to throw errors.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe K8sTaskRunner truncates task ids in order to get a valid K8s job name (less than 64 characters) and doing this can cause loss of uniqueness. I fixed this by appending a 128 bit hash onto the end of the task id which i think should be sufficient to ensure uniqueness. (Change is in KubernetesOverlordUtils).\r\n\r\nI also had to fix a related issue that was covered up by the fact that our truncation function can be applied repeatedly wihtout any affect.\r\nThe issue is the line in KubernetesPeonClient\r\nK8sTaskId taskId = new K8sTaskId(job.getMetadata().getName());.\r\nThis takes the job name from the k8s api (which has already been truncated by our truncation function since it is a job name), and then passes it into the K8sTaskId constructor as the originalTaskId. The K8sTaskId calls the truncation function a second time to generate the k8sTaskId. This is okay when our truncation function just grabs the first 63 characters of the task id since repeatedly applying this won't do anything, but with my latest changes this is no longer the case.\r\n\r\nI updated this logic to just use the job name directly from the kubernetes api (that's all it needs anyways) and I had to change a lot of function signatures to do this. I also explicitly changed the k8sTaskId field to k8sJobName since that's the only thing that field is used for.\r\n\r\nThis does make it slightly more confusing to find out which task a job corresponds to from a k8s client like k8s, but the PodTemplateTaskAdapter also applies the whole unmodified task id as a annotation.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Fixes a issue where having data source names (or more generally task ids) that are too long cause the K8sTaskRunner to throw errors.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `KubernetesOverlordUtils`\r\n * `KubernetesPeonClient`\r\n * `K8sTaskId`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nFollow up to #11717 \r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to fix the behaviour in the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n#### Case 1: Coordinator gets incorrect response in case of a quick load-drop-load\r\n1. Historical receives HTTP request to load segment S.\r\n2. Load succeeds and the cache now has an entry to the effect \"LOAD S was SUCCESS\".\r\n3. HTTP request completes with SUCCESS but the entry is still there in the cache.\r\n4. Historical receives request to drop segment S and request finishes successfully but cache still has entry for \"LOAD S was SUCCESS\"\r\n5. Historical receives request to reload segment S. Since we already have an entry in cache, historical incorrectly responds with \"LOAD S was SUCCESS\" even though the segment has already been dropped from the historical.\r\n\r\n#### Case 2: Coordinator sees a repeatedly failing load as PENDING rather than FAILED\r\n1. Coordinator requests Historical to load segment.\r\n2. Request completes while load is still in progress and gets back a PENDING response\r\n3. Then load fails and FAILED status is cached\r\n4. Coordinator checks with the Historical if it has loaded the segment.\r\n5. Since we already have a cached FAILED status, we retry the load and send back a PENDING response instead (see snippet below)\r\n6. Repeat\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/efb32810c48fd9c0bf81cefb15179f74a4cde661/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/coordination/SegmentLoadDropHandler.java#L562-L563\r\n\r\n#### Case 3:\r\n1. Coordinator requests historical to load segment.\r\n2. Historical queues load task on executor.\r\n3. Coordinator requests historical to drop segment and the Historical\r\n   - unannounces the segment immediately\r\n   - marks the drop request as a success in the cache\r\n   - adds an entry to `segmentsToDrop`\r\n   - schedules drop task on executor for 30s later\r\n4. Load task starts and removes this segment from `segmentsToDrop` and proceeds with downloading the segment.\r\n5. Load task finishes and announces the segment but is not able to update success status since the latest request is a Drop.\r\n6. Drop task does not do anything since the segment is not present in `segmentsToDrop` anymore.\r\n7. Thus the Drop request is considered a success but the segment files are never deleted.\r\n8. This might cause the Coordinator to assign this Historical beyond its disk capacity\r\n\r\nSimilarly a drop that comes before a load might result in partial or complete delete of segment files but the load task might continue to think that it succeeded.\r\n\r\n### Classes to review\r\n- `SegmentLoadDropHandler`\r\n- `SegmentLoadDropHandlerTest`\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Rename `DataSegmentChangeRequestAndStatus` to `DataSegmentChangeResponse`\r\n- Move `DataSegmentChangeResponse` out of `SegmentLoadDropHandler` as it is a POJO returned to the client and need not be tied to a specific loader implementation.\r\n- Update `requestStatuses` cache to be a map from `DataSegment` to the full `DataSegmentChangeResponse`\r\n- Remove entry from cache as soon as it is consumed to be sent back to the client\r\n- Remove entry from cache if a different type of request is received for the same segment\r\n- Rename and rearrange some methods for readability\r\n- Clean up tests and add more test cases for the new behaviour\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\nFix bug on historical when a load-drop-load of a segment happens in quick succession.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently 'auto' typed columns write out the compressed int column that holds the dictionary ids and builds the bitmap indexes during the `serialize` method of the various serializer implementations. This isn't really very chill though, and can cause heap footprints to explode for columns with high value cardinality, mainly due to the `MutableBitmap` being built on the fly. This PR switches these serializers to be more like the nested column serializers they originally came from (`GlobalDictionaryEncodedFieldColumnWriter`). These serializers now write out an uncompressed int column with the sorted dictionary ids to temp, and then iterate over this intermediate value column in the `writeTo` method to build the final compressed int column and any bitmap indexes. This shifts the heap being occupied with the `MutableBitmap` of only a single auto column at a time and only while `writeTo` is being called, trading a bit extra time in exchange for a much more predictable heap load.\r\n\r\nIn the future I would like to add a new compressed column and writer implementation that is easier to iterate over, or maybe just make it easy to just iterate over the current generic indexed based solution we have for writing compressed columns (though I would sort of like to replace using generic indexed for compression so I'd perhaps be more into doing the former). With either improvement, we could keep writing out the compressed column directly during `serialize`, and then iterate over the compressed column in `writeTo` to build the indexes.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes some bugs with the `ValueIndexes` implementation for ARRAY typed columns, as well as introduces and adds tests for `ArrayElementIndexes` used to fetch indexes for the array elements of columns.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the storage connector to interact with GCS using the API functions exposed in `google-api-services-storage`. It will allow Durable storage and MSQ's interactive APIs to work with GCS.\r\n\r\nThis also refactors the currently available S3 connector so that the chunking downloads that is currently done by the S3 connector can be extended to other connectors.\r\n\r\nDue to the current versions of libraries used, the connector has the following 3 improvement areas:\r\n\r\n1. Currently, due to the limitations of `google-api-services-storage` and the version used by it, we can't use multipart uploads or streaming uploads. Therefore GCS connector writes the intermediate contents to a file and uploads them in a single go. There are composite objects, however, the functionality seems incorrect. This can be improved once we upgrade the libraries.\r\n \r\n2. For fetching the file, there is a `isChunkedDownloads` flag which controls if we want to download in chunks using the range header, https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/xml-api/reference-headers#range, however since it can be ignored, the functionality is kept behind a flag for now. Fetching using range isn't supported in the library currently.\r\n\r\n3. All delete requests are done individually and not in a batched manner.\r\n\r\nThis implementation can be improved provided that we use the `google-cloud-storage` library instead of the `google-api-services-storage` library, though that would require a rehaul of the currently existing Google functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nTo be added\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `GoogleStorageConnector`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR adds a simple, stateless, SQL backed, data exploration view to the web console. The idea is to let users explore data in Druid with point-and-click interaction and visualizations (instead of writing SQL and looking at a table). This can provide faster time-to-value for a user new to Druid and can allow a Druid veteran to quickly chart some data that they care about.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1791\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/177816/e30e2404-864a-4b5c-a5a3-d0bd09814f43\">\r\n\r\nThe view is self contained.
