given `filter_dag_ids` is either `allowed_dag_ids`, or intersection of `allowed_dag_ids` AND `selected_dag_ids`,\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9a890fc4a32d8ce0d70cf98f7f3c2c4d648e4e29/airflow/www/views.py#L648-L651\r\n\r\n  hence, no matter if `selected_dag_ids` is `None` or not, `filter_dag_ids` should ALWAYS be considered into the SQL query.\r\n\r\n  However, currently, if `selected_dag_ids` is None, the query is actually getting the full result (then 'filter' at the end). https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9a890fc4a32d8ce0d70cf98f7f3c2c4d648e4e29/airflow/www/views.py#L727-L731\r\n  This means more (unnecessary) data travel between Airflow and DB, which should be avoided.\r\n\r\n- When we join table A and B with `A.id == B.id` (default is `INNER` join), if we always confirm ALL A.id is in a specific list,\r\n  implicitly ALL ids in the result table are already guaranteed in this specific list as well.\r\n  This is why the two redundant `.filter()` chunks are removed.\r\n\r\n I didn't do performance benchmarking, but minor performance improvement should be expected.\r\n Meanwhile, this change makes the code cleaner.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

commit unifies the mechanism of rendering output of tabular\r\ndata. This gives users a possibility to either display a tabular\r\nrepresentation of data or render it as valid json or yaml payload.\r\n\r\nCloses: #12699\r\n\r\nInstead of using [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) to render commands output we use [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich). Due to this change the `--output` argument will no longer accept formats of tabulate tables. Instead it accepts:\r\n- `table` - will render the output in predefined table\r\n- `json` - will render the output as a json\r\n- `yaml` - will render the output as yaml\r\n\r\nBy doing this we increased consistency and gave users possibility to manipulate the output programmatically (when using json or yaml).\r\n\r\nAffected commands:\r\n\r\n  - `airflow dags list`\r\n - `airflow dags report`\r\n - `airflow dags list-runs`\r\n - `airflow dags list-jobs`\r\n - `airflow connections list`\r\n - `airflow connections get`\r\n - `airflow pools list`\r\n - `airflow pools get`\r\n - `airflow pools set`\r\n - `airflow pools delete`\r\n - `airflow pools export`\r\n - `airflow role list`\r\n - `airflow providers list`\r\n - `airflow providers get`\r\n - `airflow tasks states-for-dag-run`\r\n - `airflow users list`\r\n - `airflow variables list`\r\n\r\n## Example:\r\nTable:\r\n```\r\nroot@e794bcc2d698:/opt/airflow# airflow tasks states-for-dag-run tasks_are_awesome

`pkg_resources.iter_entry_points` validates the version\nconstraints, and if any fail it will throw an Exception for that\nentrypoint.\n\nThis sounds nice, but is a huge mis-feature.\n\nSo instead of that, switch to using importlib.metadata (well, it's\nbackport importlib_metadata) that just gives us the entrypoints - no\nother verification of requirements is performed.\n\nThis has two advantages:\n\n1. providers and plugins load much more reliably.\n2. it's faster too\n\nCloses #12692\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

clarified the behaviour of --constraint flag and it turned\r\nout that the earlier behaviour where constraint files were used\r\nwas an accidental behaviour. We can have the same behaviour\r\nby switching to --requirement flag. Note that the requirement\r\nflag is not \"permanent\" it is only effective during the PIP\r\nresolving which dependencies to install now - it does not\r\nimpose requirements for the packages being installed in the\r\nfuture, which is the exact behaviour we want to get.\r\n\r\nHere is more info about deprecating the old --constraints behaviour:\r\n\r\nDEPRECATION: Constraints are only allowed to take the form of a package\r\nname and a version specifier. Other forms were originally permitted\r\nas an accident of the implementation, but were undocumented. The new\r\nimplementation of the resolver no longer supports these forms. A\r\npossible replacement is replacing\r\nthe constraint with a requirement..

refactor SQL/BigQuery Check operators to reduce duplicated code:\r\n- create `BaseSQLOperator`: it standardizes how some of the generic SQL operators retrieve DB hook with the `.get_db_hook()` method\r\n  - Add a `database` kwarg `*CheckOperators` for a consistent interface \r\n- create `_BigQueryDbHookMixin` to standardize the `.get_db_hook()` method for BigQuery\r\n- create `_QuboleCheckOperatorMixin` to remove duplicate code\r\n- replace `<class-name>.template_fields` with `_get_template_fields` in `__getattribute__` to avoid hard coding class name, and reduce duplicate code\r\n- remove and deprecate `DruidCheckOperator` the same functionality can be achieved by `SQLCheckOperator` - the deprecation method is the same for `PrestoCheckOperator`\r\n\r\nMisc:\r\n- Fix docstrings\r\n- Update deprecated Operator name and import path\r\n- Remove unnecessary `if` statements check parameters in `SQLBranchOperator`\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

\r\nA pretty quick fix on the chart for something a bit annoying.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe chart has two jobs (migrate-database & create-user).\r\nThese jobs are run post-install and post-upgrade and only deleted on success.\r\n\r\nSo if for some reason (quick reinstall / upgrade), the job fails or is stuck then helm\r\nwill fail because the job already exists.\r\n\r\nThis commit sets the `helm.sh/hook-delete-policy` to `before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded`\r\nso helm will always delete the jobs before creating them again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code

deploying with the Helm chart using an ingress for flower that has a path (`ingress.flower.path`) flower is currently unusable.\r\nFlower by default assumes that it will be serving url starting on `/` and it must be told via [url_prefix][1] if it's actual url is not based directly on `/`. \r\nCurrently there is no way (that I know of) to pass `url_prefix` to the Flower deployment/pod. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new helm chart value `flower.url_prefix` to allow for that. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#url-prefix\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for

on #12596 so only the last commit counts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe missed that when we added support\r\nfor differnet mysql versions in #7717 when we removed default\r\ncharacter set setting for the database server.\r\n\r\nThis change forces the default on database server to be\r\nutf8mb4 - regardless if MySQL 5.7 or MySQL8 is used.\r\nUtf8mb4 is default for MySQL8 but latin1 is default fo MySQL 5.7.\r\n\r\nThere was a suspected root cause of the problem:\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/charset-connection.html\r\nwhere mysql client falls back to the default collation if\r\nthe client8 is used with 5.7 database, but this should be\r\nno problem if the default DB character set is forced to be\r\nutf8mb4\r\n\r\nThis PR restores forcing the server-side encoding.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Volumes, Images resources etc. Although Kubernetes has a `restartPolicy` which is set to `never` when Airflow creates Pods, this restartPolicy only comes into effect when the container is running. Kubernetes has separate restart policies for different reasons a pod might not start. \r\n\r\nAirflow users on Kubernetes <= 1.15 can encounter [this error](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/79398) where pods that fail with reason `FailedCreatePodSandBox` will not attempt to retry due to a bug. In Airflow this manifests itself as an indefinitely queuing pod.  In later Kubernetes versions this has been resolved.\r\n\r\nThe issue is Kubernetes doesn't [give granular enough restart configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/88193#issuecomment-659858179), So there is a mismatch between Airflow controlling restarts and Kubernetes controlling restarts. In order for Airflow to be the only thing restarting, it must be ensured that before marking something as FAILED in Airflow for a retry, that the resource has been removed in Kubernetes so that Kubernetes does not retry.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nrelated: #12264\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

to a bug in Breeze initialization code, we were always running\r\nagainst Postgres 9.6 and MySQL 5.7, even when the matrix selected\r\nsomething else.\r\n    \r\n(We were overwriting the POSTGRES_VERSION and MYSQL_VERSION environment\r\nvariables in initialization code)\r\n    \r\nThere was a connected problem that hidden the utf8mb4 problem as we\r\nmigrated to MySQL client 8, where utf8mb4 in mysql client 8\r\nwas silently falling back to latin 1 on database creation time\r\nand we have not detected that.\r\n    \r\nWe also fix uf8mb4 migration problem that was hidden due to those\r\nmissing tests.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/12588\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

made `conn_id` unique, and this is effective from 2.0.*. Due to this change, `BaseHook.get_connections()` will return a List of length 1, or raise Exception.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, we should simply always get the only element from the output, and drop `random.choice()` in `BaseHook.get_connection()`, which was only applicable for the earlier setting (multiple connections is allowed for single `conn_id`, which is no longer true).\r\n\r\n### A Side Question\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/9067 is rolled out, I would question if we still need `hook.get_connections()` (note NOT `get_connection()`). This needs change in bigger scope and may be a breaking change for many users. So I'm not addressing/touching it in this PR.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
