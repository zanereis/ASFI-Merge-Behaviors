A master key has been setup using the `ambari-server setup-security` CLI (using option # 2 - Encrypt passwords stored in ambari.properties file)\r\n2. The Ambari server configuration property named `security.server.encrypt_sensitive_data` is set to `true`\r\n\r\nWIP: the API still return the encrypted form; I'm not sure if this needs to be changed...\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated unit tests and they passed:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD

expected:\r\n\r\n1. installed the latest Ambari and replaced the `setupSecurity.py` and the generated JAR then restarted the server and the agents\r\n2. configured LDAP by running `ambari-server setup-ldap` (some attributes are changed in the below sample such as server name, etc...)\r\n3. checked the database: the manager password was stored in encrypted form\r\n4. synced LDAP users successfully\r\n\r\n```\r\n[root@c7401 ~]# ambari-server setup-ldap --ambari-admin-username=admin --ambari-admin-password=admin --ldap-url=TEST_LDAP_SERVER --ldap-user-class=user

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOptionally execute the post user creation hook on existing users during LDAP sync.\r\n\r\nThe post user creation hook is executed on users when created or imported into Ambari. This hook is executed given the following criteria is met:\r\n\r\n1. The post user creation hook is enabled (ambari.properties - `ambari.post.user.creation.hook.enabled = true,` default: `false`)\r\n2. The post user creation hook is set and available (ambari.properties - `ambari.post.user.creation.hook = <path to script>`, default: `/var/lib/ambari-server/resources/scripts/post-user-creation-hook.sh`)\r\n3. HDFS is installed and running.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to have executed the LDAP sync process before all of the criteria has been met. Therefore, it would be beneficial to trigger the post user creation hook to be executed on these users when the criteria has been met.\r\n\r\nTo do this, an optional property should be set on the LDAP sync request - post_process_existing_users. The post_process_existing_users property is part of a \"spec\" object and should be set to either \"true\" or \"false\", if set at all. If set to \"true\", the post user creation hook will be executed on all user's that come back from the LDAP query that also exist in the Ambari database as LDAP users.\r\n\r\nExample REST API calls:\r\n**Sync All Users and Groups**\r\n```\r\nPOST /api/v1/ldap_sync_events\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"Event\": {\r\n      \"specs\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"principal_type\": \"users\",\r\n          \"sync_type\": \"all\",\r\n          \"post_process_existing_users\" : \"true\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"principal_type\": \"groups\",\r\n          \"sync_type\": \"all\",\r\n          \"post_process_existing_users\" : \"true\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n**Sync Specific Users**\r\n```\r\nPOST /api/v1/ldap_sync_events\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"Event\": {\r\n      \"specs\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"principal_type\": \"users\",\r\n          \"sync_type\": \"specific\",\r\n          \"names\" : \"user1, user2, user3\",\r\n          \"post_process_existing_users\" : \"true\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n**Sync Specific Groups**\r\n```\r\nPOST /api/v1/ldap_sync_events\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"Event\": {\r\n      \"specs\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"principal_type\": \"groups\",\r\n          \"sync_type\": \"specific\",\r\n          \"names\" : \"hadoop_users, hadoop_admins\",\r\n          \"post_process_existing_users\" : \"true\"\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the Ambari sync-ldap CLI, an optional argument named \"--post-process-existing-users\" may be added to enable this feature.\r\n\r\nExample CLI calls:\r\n**Sync All Users and Groups**\r\n```\r\nambari-server sync-ldap --all --post-process-existing-users\r\n```\r\n**Sync Specific Users**\r\n```\r\nambari-server sync-ldap --users users.txt --post-process-existing-users\r\n```\r\n**Sync Specific Groups**\r\n```\r\nambari-server sync-ldap --groups groups.txt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track two changes to the SPI and to Ambari:\r\n\r\n- The SPI should provide a mechanism where 'UpgradeCheck' classes can make web requests using a connection factory that is able to leverage Ambari's cookie store, truststore, and timeout values. This is now done through the `HttpURLConnectionProvider` which is backed by a `URLStreamProvider` and can provide ready-to-go `HttpURLConnection` instances.\r\n\r\n- Upgrade checks provided by a stack can be marked as 'required' in the 'UpgradeCheckInfo'. This prevents them from being explicitly defined in the upgrade pack XML. However, since Ambari loads 100's of 1000's of classes, a `ClassLoader` scan can take too long. Using the 'Reflections' library, we're able to pass in the URLs of the JARs which comprise the plugin `ClassLoader` and are able to perform the scan very quickly.\r\n\r\n- The `pom.xml` needed to be updated to include a version of `guava` which was compatible with the version of `reflections`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Unit tests updated\r\n- Tested using the old `RangerPasswordCheck` which makes several calls to Ranger in order to determine if the password Ambari stores is the correct one for logging in via the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe data of widget in the database will not be deleted when the service (for example YARN) uninstalling. And when installing,will check if the widget exists by clusterId,widget_name,user and default_section_name. The focus is on default_section_name. In the `if` statement, the default value will be set by `SECTION_NAME`. But in the `else` statement, no default value will be set. Then the widget created in the first installation can not be find in the next installation, and another widget (same with the previous) will be created repeatedly.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests.\r\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. Ex: unit tests, manual tests)\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screen-shot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review [Ambari Contributing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSupport setting `provision_action` at the service- and component-level.  The former is necessary so that the feature is available while also using layout recommendation.\n\nThe implementation uses predicates to filter the services/components/hosts for which install task should be performed or skipped.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-25006\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit test.\n\nManually tested requests with various `provision_action` settings.\n\n#### Explicit layout\n\nRequest:\n\n```\n{\n  \"operation_type\": \"ADD_SERVICE\",\n  \"components\": [\n    { \"name\": \"KAFKA_BROKER\", \"provision_action\": \"INSTALL_ONLY\",\n      \"hosts\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"c7401.ambari.apache.org\" } ]\n    },\n    { \"name\": \"KAFKA_BROKER\",\n      \"hosts\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"c7402.ambari.apache.org\" } ]\n    },\n    { \"name\": \"METRICS_COLLECTOR\",\n      \"hosts\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"c7401.ambari.apache.org\" } ]\n    },\n    { \"name\": \"METRICS_GRAFANA\", \"provision_action\": \"INSTALL_ONLY\",\n      \"hosts\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"c7402.ambari.apache.org\" } ]\n    },\n    { \"name\": \"METRICS_MONITOR\",\n      \"hosts\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"c7401.ambari.apache.org\" }, { \"fqdn\": \"c7402.ambari.apache.org\" } ]\n    }\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\nc7401:\n\nKAFKA_BROKER INSTALL\nMETRICS_COLLECTOR INSTALL\nMETRICS_MONITOR INSTALL\nMETRICS_COLLECTOR START\nMETRICS_MONITOR START\n\nc7402:\n\nKAFKA_BROKER INSTALL\nMETRICS_GRAFANA INSTALL\nMETRICS_MONITOR INSTALL\nKAFKA_BROKER START\nMETRICS_MONITOR START\n```\n\n#### Layout recommendation\n\nRequest:\n\n```\n{\n  \"operation_type\": \"ADD_SERVICE\",\n  \"provision_action\": \"INSTALL_ONLY\",\n  \"services\": [\n    { \"name\": \"AMBARI_METRICS\" },\n    { \"name\": \"KAFKA\", \"provision_action\": \"INSTALL_AND_START\" },\n    { \"name\":

\"provision_action\": \"INSTALL_AND_START\",\n      \"hosts\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"c7402.ambari.apache.org\" } ]\n    }\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nResult:\n\n```\nc7401:\n\nINFRA_SOLR INSTALL\nKAFKA_BROKER INSTALL\nMETRICS_COLLECTOR INSTALL\nMETRICS_GRAFANA INSTALL\nMETRICS_MONITOR INSTALL\nKAFKA_BROKER START\n\nc7402:\n\nINFRA_SOLR INSTALL\nINFRA_SOLR_CLIENT INSTALL\nMETRICS_MONITOR INSTALL\nINFRA_SOLR START\n```\n\n#### Invalid request\n\nRequest with conflicting settings:\n\n```\n{\n  \"operation_type\": \"ADD_SERVICE\",\n  \"components\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"METRICS_COLLECTOR\",\n      \"hosts\": [ { \"fqdn\": \"c7401.ambari.apache.org\" } ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"METRICS_MONITOR\", \"provision_action\": \"INSTALL_ONLY\",\n      \"hosts\": [ { \"fqdn\":

This is generally the accepted behavior. However, there may be cases where identities from remote clusters (using the same Kerberos realm) need to be translated to local names.\r\n\r\nA use case may be that some slave component for a service is installed on a remote cluster, but that component is not installed on the local cluster. However a master component of that service is installed on the local cluster and the slave component from the remote cluster needs to communicate with it.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to add a new property to kerberos-env, maybe named `include_all_components_in_auth_to_local_rules`, where the default value is `false`. If set to `true`, when building the auth-to-local rules, Ambari should add the rules for all components of installed services, not just the installed components (which is what it does today).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test to cover this case:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 27:55 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2018-12-13T11:14:26+01:00\r\n[INFO] Final Memory: 170M/1724M\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally the following E2E test has been executed:\r\n\r\n1. installed a cluster with HDFS (and Kafka, but it's irrelevant now since Kafka does not support our `auth to local` feature) without `NFSGateway`\r\n<img width=\"793\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-12-13 at 10 34 14 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34065904/49933551-33c2fb80-fecc-11e8-9117-01c1037b7347.png\">\r\n\r\n2. applied my changes (replaced the server JAR with the new one and edited the `kerberos-env.xml` to have the new property)\r\n3.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAllow skipping the following checks in Add Service request validation:\n\n * security type in the request must match security type of the cluster\n * Kerberos-related configs (`kerberos-env`, `krb5-conf`) should not be modified\n * Kerberos descriptor is provided only for new services being added\n\nBy default the existing, strict validation is applied.  The new one can be turned on by including `\"validation\": \"PERMISSIVE\"` in the request.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-25037\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested that:\n\n *

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd Service request can list `\"services\"` and/or `\"components\"`:\n\n * only `\"services\"`: use layout recommended by stack advisor\n * both `\"services\"` and `\"components\"`: use layout recommended by stack advisor, but pass \"partial\" layout as input to the advisor\n * only `\"components\"`: use explicit layout specified in the request\n\nThe last one currently doesn't work, recommendation is always called, and possibly adds unwanted components.\n\nThis change skips the call to layout recommendation if `\"services\"` section is not present in the request, ie. if it's an explicit layout.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-25033\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested install with explicit layout, excluding Metrics Grafana:\n\n```\n{\n  \"operation_type\": \"ADD_SERVICE\",\n  \"components\": [\n    { \"component_name\": \"METRICS_COLLECTOR\", \"fqdn\": \"c7401.ambari.apache.org\" },\n    { \"component_name\": \"METRICS_MONITOR\", \"fqdn\": \"c7401.ambari.apache.org\" }\n  ],\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"ams-site\": {\n        \"timeline.metrics.hbase.init.check.enabled\": \"false\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n$ cat /var/lib/ambari-agent/data/command-[56]?.json | jq -r '.role, .roleCommand' | xargs -n2\nMETRICS_COLLECTOR INSTALL\nMETRICS_MONITOR INSTALL\nKERBEROS_CLIENT

\"ADD_SERVICE\",\n  \"services\": [\n    { \"name\": \"AMBARI_METRICS\" }\n  ],\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"ams-site\": {\n        \"timeline.metrics.hbase.init.check.enabled\":

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix the bug that if component XY is provisioned with `START_ONLY`, and component X is a prefix of XY, then the provision action is applied to both X and XY.\n\nIn addition, refactor related code to reduce clutter in `AmbariManagementControllerImpl` a tiny bit.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-25000\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases in unit test.\n\nTested cluster deployment via blueprint, verified that only the correct component is provisioned with `START_ONLY`:\n\n```\n2018-12-10 14:22:00,642  INFO

In this case the following question(s) were being asked:\r\n1. Do you want to provide custom TrustStore for Ambari?\r\n2. Optionally: if custom trust store was set previously the tool displays the earlier configuration and asks the following: Do you want to remove these properties?\r\n\r\nTo address this issue I modified the tool to find out whether it's being executed in non-interactive mode or not. Non-interactive mode, in this respect, means that all properties which require a non-empty answer have their answers provided via CLI options.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIn addition to running unit tests I've executed several E2E tests within my vagrant environment; see test results in this file:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd Service request already has Kerberos descriptor/reference, but it was being ignored until this change.\n\n * `kerberos_descriptor` in the request was a string, which requires the actual descriptor to be escaped.  Changed it to a Map, so that it can be specified as part of the main JSON.  This is how it works in blueprints, too.\n * Load Kerberos descriptor if provided by reference\n * Validate the descriptor, including a check that it should not include any services not being added in the request (ie. existing or unknown ones)\n * Merge overrides given in the request into the user-specified Kerberos descriptor (if already exists)\n * Save the (possibly updated) descriptor as artifact\n\nMisc. fixes/improvements:\n\n * fixed bug in serialization of `SecurityConfiguration` due to interchanged field names for `kerberos_descriptor` and `kerberos_descriptor_reference`\n * extracted check-and-log methods to `LoggingPreconditions` (suggestions for a better name welcome!)\n * verify KDC credentials before creating any resources\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-25007\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested add service request with valid kerberos descriptor, both with and without previous user-specified descriptor.  Verified that user-specified descriptor is applied (eg. custom configs and keytab filename).\n\n```\n$ curl

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd request-level support for `provision_action` to the complex Add Service request.\r\n\r\nHost component-level support will be added in a later change.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-24988\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested requests with each of the 3 provision action types, as well as request without specific provision action.  For start-only, manually pre-installed all required packages.\r\n\r\nAfter the requests completed, queried the service, component, and host component states to verify they are as requested.\r\n\r\nFor start-only, also verified that no install tasks were created/executed for the services being added.","created_at":"2018-12-05T11:12:57Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T17:02:57Z","closed_at":"2018-12-05T17:00:47Z","merged_at":"2018-12-05T17:00:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"b268518b25ee9f78d00926b27516a773ea58967c","assignee":{"login":"adoroszlai","id":6454655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTQ2NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6454655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai","html_url":"https://github.com/adoroszlai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"adoroszlai","id":6454655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTQ2NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6454655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai","html_url":"https://github.com/adoroszlai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/2691/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/2691/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/2691/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/statuses/1905b07384e380d69c6f1587c86e43764485633b","head":{"label":"adoroszlai:AMBARI-24988_trunk","ref":"AMBARI-24988_trunk","sha":"1905b07384e380d69c6f1587c86e43764485633b","user":{"login":"adoroszlai","id":6454655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTQ2NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6454655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai","html_url":"https://github.com/adoroszlai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":116725725,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTY3MjU3MjU=","name":"ambari","full_name":"adoroszlai/ambari","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adoroszlai","id":6454655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTQ2NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6454655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai","html_url":"https://github.com/adoroszlai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoroszlai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adoroszlai/ambari","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHandle requests from a configured trusted proxy to identify a proxied user using Kerberos.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving a request where that caller is identified using Kerberos, check to see of the request was from a (trusted) proxy.  If so, validate the trusted proxy and set the authenticated user to the proxied user specified in the \"`doAs`\" query parameter. \r\n\r\nAfter receiving a request where the user is to be authenticated using Kerberos, perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Determine if a proxied user is specified using a \"`doAs`\" query parameter.\r\n2. Using the following Ambari configuration property, determine if a proxied user can be specified from the requesting host:\r\n    -  `ambari.tproxy.proxyuser.$username.hosts`, where $username is the username of the authenticated user (not the user specified in the doAs query parameter)\r\n3. Obtain the proxied username from the `doAs` query parameter\r\n4. Using the following Ambari configuration property, determine if the proxied user can be specified based on the user's username:\r\n    -  `ambari.tproxy.proxyuser.$username.users`, where $username is the username of the authenticated user \r\n5.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAmbari's `File()` provider creates files at the final location, then sets metadata (ownership and permissions), which makes the file visible to other processes with possibly the wrong permissions.\nThis may be a functional problem if parallel execution is enabled (due to too strict initial permissions), and a security concern (in case of too wide initial permissions).\n\nThis patch changes the order of operations:\n  1. create file in temporary location\n  2. set metadata\n  3. move to final location\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-24981\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested blueprint cluster deployment on CentOS 7.4 and Ubuntu 16.4, both with root and non-root Ambari setup.  Executed service checks after deployment.\n\nVerified order of operations in agent output:\n\n```\n2018-12-01 16:13:31,835 - File['/etc/krb5.conf'] {'owner': 'root', 'content': InlineTemplate(...),

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImproved validation of the complex Add Service request.\r\n\r\n * check for existing services being added (previously only components were checked for the same)\r\n * check if all referenced hosts are associated with the cluster\r\n * allow omitting stack name and version, use cluster's current stack in this case\r\n * move the check that handled the \"no services and no components\" case (previously it resulted in JSON parse exceptions)\r\n\r\nRefactored validation code to a separate class.\r\n\r\nAdded unit test for request validation.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-24972\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIn addition to new unit tests, tested the API manually:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ curl -X POST

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDuring a stack upgrade, it is possible for upgrade packs to specify custom Java classes which will run in order to alter configurations or perform other tasks on the cluster. The following is an example of this type of action:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<task xsi:type=\"server_action\" class=\"org.apache.ambari.server.serveraction.upgrades.RangerKmsProxyConfig\">\r\n  <summary>Adding Ranger proxy user properties under kms-site</summary>\r\n</task>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHistorically, these tasks have typically been used to alter configurations of the cluster using more complex logic than the XML markup in an upgrade pack could provide. \r\n\r\nWith stacks and mpacks being moved out of Apache source control, Ambari needs a way for 3rd party developers to provide these actions with the delivery of their stack.\r\n\r\n- The Ambari API/SPI created as part of AMBARI-24685 will need to include classes which provide retrieval and modification of configurations in addition to contracts for the server-side action\r\n- Ambari will need to scan for matching classes and register them during the upgrade\r\n\r\n**Note that a bunch of stack-specific actions were removed in this commit. They will need to be converted and compiled along with the HDP stack moving forward. This is similar to how upgrade checks operate.**\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- New unit tests written to cover the `PluginUpgradeServerAction`. \r\n- Converted one of the removed classes to use the SPI, and performed an upgrade, verifying that the class was loaded and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd service request now uses stack advisor for getting recommended component layout. \r\n\r\nUsers may chose to specify the layout for some or all components in the request. In this case the user specified layout will be passed as input to stack advisor.\r\n\r\nThe resulting topology layout is validated by stack advisor. If there are validation issues, those will be logged out on WARNING level. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- Tested manually recommendations on a single host cluster and on a three hosts cluster\r\n- Tested hostgroup strategy configuration manually\r\n- Wrote new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe Ambari kerberos wizard for Existing FreeIPA displays a warning about setting up a password policy without expiration for the kerberos principals.\r\n\r\nAs these (user and service) principals are not created with a password, the password expiration policy does not apply to them -> removed this warning.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. replaced the old `/usr/lib/ambari-server/web/javascripts/app.js` with the new one\r\n2. restarted the server\r\n3. started the `Enbable Kerberos` wizard\r\n4. selected `Existing IPA` from the KDC type options\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n<img width=\"1612\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-11-27 at 4 54 36 pm\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAllow using Add Service request in clusters with Kerberos.\n\n * Add `security` and `credentials` to the request syntax\n * Store credentials from the request, but allow the case when credential is already available (eg. from initial cluster install)\n * `security/type` is optional, but validated if specified\n\nKerberos descriptor is not stored yet.\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nDeployed secure cluster with ZooKeeper and Infra Solr via blueprint.  Added Kafka and Ambari Metrics via Add Service

Indicating whether to enable/disable LDAP authentication for Ambari itself\r\n2. Indicating whether Ambari should manage the LDAP configurations for specified services\r\n3. A comma separated list of services that are expected to be configured for LDAP (it is allowed to use `*` to indicate ALL services)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy extending existing unit tests with the new scenarios:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 25:51 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2018-11-26T19:08:08+01:00\r\n[INFO] Final Memory: 162M/874M\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to this I executed `ambari-server setup-ldap` with and without the following CLI options; the tool behaved as expected in all cases and the new data has been saved in the DB:\r\n`--ldap-enabled-ambari`\r\n`--ldap-manage-services`\r\n`--ldap-enabled-services`\r\n\r\n**Important note:** the [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-24951) indicated that we have to add a new question and CLI option to populate `User group member attribute (memberOf)` field; this change will come in a separate PR (I did not want to mix it with the service management)","created_at":"2018-11-26T18:35:45Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T09:27:04Z","closed_at":"2018-11-27T09:26:54Z","merged_at":"2018-11-27T09:26:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"4d245a1196bbcf6e2ca9b77901bf3942f3ac60f8","assignee":{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"smolnar82","id":34065904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDY1OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34065904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82","html_url":"https://github.com/smolnar82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smolnar82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zeroflag","id":641365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag","html_url":"https://github.com/zeroflag","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zeroflag/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rlevas","id":7302947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDI5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7302947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlevas","html_url":"https://github.com/rlevas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlevas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlevas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlevas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlevas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlevas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlevas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlevas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlevas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rlevas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":801664623,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MDE2NjQ2MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/labels/security","name":"security","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null},{"id":822832027,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjI4MzIwMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/labels/LDAP","name":"LDAP","color":"d8f989","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/2652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/2652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/issues/2652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ambari/statuses/a845c0e4e2d8ad0eff32ccb995aea6403bb67ba7","head":{"label":"smolnar82:AMBARI-24951","ref":"AMBARI-24951","sha":"a845c0e4e2d8ad0eff32ccb995aea6403bb67ba7","user":{"l

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTrying to create duplicate resources of some kind (users, version definitions, credentials) results in the wrong HTTP response (`HTTP 500 Internal Server Error` or `HTTP 400 Bad Request`).  For most other resources, eg. services, the response is `HTTP 409 Conflict`.  This PR changes HTTP response for duplicate credentials, users and version definitions to be consistent with the rest of Ambari Server.\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST \"http://${AMBARI_SERVER}:8080/api/v1/users/admin\"\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\n{\n  \"status\" : 500,\n  \"message\" : \"An internal system exception occurred: The requested username already exists.\"\n}\n\n$ curl -X POST -d @- \"http://${AMBARI_SERVER}:8080/api/v1/clusters/TEST/credentials/kdc.admin.principal\" <<EOF\n{\n  \"Credential\": {\n    \"type\": \"TEMPORARY\",\n    \"principal\": \"admin/admin\",\n    \"key\": \"k\"\n  }\n}\nEOF\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\n{\n  \"status\" : 500,\n  \"message\" : \"An internal system exception occurred: A credential with the alias of kdc.admin.principal already exists\"\n}\n\n$ curl -X POST -d @- \"http://${AMBARI_SERVER}:8080/api/v1/version_definitions\" <<EOF\n{\n  \"VersionDefinition\": {\n    \"version_url\": \"file:///tmp/duplicate_url.xml\"\n  }\n}\nEOF\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\n{\n  \"status\" : 500,\n  \"message\" : \"An internal system exception occurred: Base url http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/HDP/centos7/3.x/updates/3.0.0.0 is already defined for another repository version.
