Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the regression introduced by #9755, by still considering pending clustering when scheduling a new clustering plan.\r\n\r\nRefactoring of `ClusteringUtils` methods is also done to avoid confusion:\r\n- Consolidates `#isClusteringCommit`, `#isPendingClusteringInstant` into `#isClusteringInstant` to check if a requested, inflight, or completed instant of replacecommit action is a clustering operation.\r\n- Renames `#isClusteringInstant` to `#isCompletedClusteringInstant`\r\n\r\nThe tests are added to guard the fix, so that before the fix the test fails, and after the fix, the test succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n-

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe added support to deduce spurious log blocks with log block reader (https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9545 and https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9611 ) in 0.14.0. \r\nApparently there are some cases where it could lead to data loss or data consistency issues. \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9611#issuecomment-2016687160 \r\nSo, we are reverting the changes for now until we have a thorough patch where we can deduce such spurious log blocks. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo data consistency issues w/ log record reader. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixing schedule compaction bug.  \r\nLooks like when polling timeline for last successful compaction commits, we also include replace commits. So, if a user sets clustering freq to 4 and compaction freq to 5, compaction scheduling may never kick in at all. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nScheduling of compaction will be triggered at the cadence configured.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen there are repeated duplicate deletes to the partition file list in `files` partition of the MDT, the current HoodieMetadataPayload merging logic drops such \"deletion\", causing the file that is deleted from the file system and supposed to be deleted from MDT file listing still left in MDT, because the merging logic of file system metadata does not account for such a case.  Other MDT partitions have already considered repeated deletes when merging payloads.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the logic.  New tests are added around the repeated deletes (the tests fail before the fix and succeed after the fix).\r\n\r\nThe impact of this bug is that deleted files may still exist in MDT if there are repeated delete operations.  It does not cause any data loss.\r\n\r\nHere's a concrete example of how this bug causes the ingestion to fail:\r\n\r\n(1) A data file and file group are replaced by clustering.  The data file is still on the file system and in MDT file listing.\r\n\r\n(2) A cleaner plan is generated to delete the data file.\r\n\r\n(3) The cleaner plan is executed the first time, and fails before commit due to Spark job shutdown.\r\n\r\n(4) The ingestion continues and succeeds, and another cleaner plan is generated containing the same data file/file group to delete.\r\n\r\n(5) The first cleaner plan is successfully executed, incurring deletion to the file list with a metadata payload, and this is added to one log file in MDT, e.g.,\r\n```\r\nHoodieMetadataPayload {key=partition, type=2, Files: {creations=[], deletions=[7f6b146e-cd43-4fd3-9ce0-118232562569-0_63-29223-5579389_20240303214408245.parquet], }}\r\n```\r\n(6) The second cleaner plan is also successfully executed, incurring deletion to the file list with a metadata payload containing the same data file to delete, and this is added to a subsequent log file in the same file slice in MDT, e.g.,\r\n```\r\nHoodieMetadataPayload {key=partition, type=2, Files: {creations=[], deletions=[7f6b146e-cd43-4fd3-9ce0-118232562569-0_63-29223-5579389_20240303214408245.parquet], }} \r\n```\r\n(7) The replacecommit corresponds to the clustering is archived as the cleaner has deleted the replaced file groups.\r\n\r\n(8) When reading MDT or MDT compaction happens, the merging of these two metadata payloads with identical deletes leads to empty deletion, so the data file is not deleted from the partition file list in MDT.  The expected behavior is to keep the data file in the \"deletions\" field.\r\n```\r\nHoodieMetadataPayload {key=partition, type=2, Files: {creations=[], deletions=[], }}\r\n```\r\n(9) Next time, when doing upsert and indexing, the deleted data file is served by the file system view based on MDT (e.g., `7f6b146e-cd43-4fd3-9ce0-118232562569-0_63-29223-5579389_20240303214408245.parquet`), and the data file cannot be found on the file system, causing the ingestion to fail.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMDT bug fix.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe have two `@BeforeEach` in `HoodieDeltaStreamerTestBase` without any guarantees of execution ordering. The reason for this situation is that the section with all `@Before*` and `@After*` is interrupted by `prepareInitialConfigs()` and `writeCommonPropsToFile()`. Refactored annotated methods to prevent future mistakes.\r\n\r\nThis MR could be a possible fix for HUDI-7467, but I couldn't reproduce the failure from the issue locally.\r\n\r\n###

not be created successfully.\r\n\r\nWe try to fix this issue by: \r\n1. Use a unique token in `HoodiePartitionMetadata#trySave()` to support concurrent write\r\n2. Throw exception when failed to write partition metadata file.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix the concurrently write same partition metadata issue.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSort the input records based on new configs for INSERT operation.The records are globally sorted (within an input batch). This allows for efficient pruning of files (based on column stats) on the query path.\r\n\r\nBaseSparkCommitActionExecutor sorts the input records (if the configs are set) based on partition-path + sort-column. The default sort-column is the record-key.\r\n\r\nA new UpsertSortPartitioner is implemented which assigns a contiguous chunk of sorted input records to a given bucket (or spark RDD partition).\r\n\r\nThe follwoing changes are made in this PR:\r\nHoodieWriteConfig.java: Two new configs to enable/diable sorting for insert operation AND to specify custom sort columns.\r\n\r\nBaseSparkCommitActionExecutor.java: The input records are sorted (using JavaRDD::sortBy(...) lazy evaluator) here and subsequently indexed (using JavaRDD::zipWithIndex(...) lazy evaluator). The sorted records are subsequently fed to the new UpsertSortPartitioner to assign contiguous chunk of sorted records to a specific bucket (or Spark RDD partition).\r\n\r\nUpsertSortPartitioner.java: New partitioner that extends from UpsertPartitioner. There are two major changes (as compared to UpsertPartitioner). \r\n1. The partitionPath in the workload profile is extracted as a sorted list before UpsertPartitioner can assign bucket numbers to Hudi partition. Since the records are sorted on the prefix of partition-path, this ensures that a contiguous chunk of sorted  input records can be assigned to specific buckets.\r\n2. getPartition(...) method is overridden with logic so that successive indexed and sorted input records can be assigned to the same bucket i.e a contiguous chunk of input records are assigned to the same bucket.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAllows the input records to be globally sorted for insert operation. This means that the records will be bin-packed into new files in a sorted manner (allowing for efficient pruning of files in the query path). The existing small files are bin-packed first and hence those existing small files may not be efficiently pruned.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow. Existing tests and new tests should suffice. the new functionality is guarded behind a config (which is default disabled)\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNew config op[tions need to be documented.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-18T06:11:50Z","updated_at":"2024-03-27T22:11:12Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719846715,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODQ2NzE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/writer-core","name":"writer-core","color":"3F460E","default":false,"description":"Issues

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up for #9871 . We can eliminate the restrictions for 2 reasons:\r\n\r\n1. we now always generate fresh new compaction instant timestamp instead of concatenating with a special suffix, so the filtering and ordering based on the instant time is now broken(even under OCC, the compaction instant time would be greater than the instant from DT that triggers it.) The MDT reader actually checks the validity for the instants from MDT after the fix: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8797\r\n2. the rollback and cleaning for MOR table log files is simplified just as the COW table to remove log files, so the rollback is very straightforward, and there is no need for this check.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow medium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe current logic for computing offset ranges is leading to skews and negative offsets because of the way they are calculated. \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/sources/helpers/KafkaOffsetGen.java#L144 \r\n\r\nProblems faced. \r\n1. We are calculating eventsPerPartition based on available partitions this can lead to skews where one partition handles only 1-10 messages and the remaining one handles 100K messages, the idea for minPartitions is to increase the parallelism and ensure that each spark task is reading approximately the same number of events. \r\n2. remainingPartitions can become negative when finalRanges exceeds the size of minPartitions. \r\n3. Complicated fork in code when minPartitions > toOffsetsMap, this is not required IMO and the default minPartitions can always fall back toOffsetsMap.size(), this takes care of situations when the partitions increase in kafka as well. \r\n\r\n```\r\n          long remainingEvents = actualNumEvents - allocatedEvents;\r\n          long remainingPartitions = toOffsetMap.size() - allocatedPartitionsThisLoop.size();\r\n          // if need tp split into minPartitions, recalculate the remainingPartitions\r\n          if (needSplitToMinPartitions) {\r\n            remainingPartitions = minPartitions - finalRanges.size();\r\n          }\r\n          long eventsPerPartition = (long) Math.ceil((1.0 * remainingEvents) / remainingPartitions);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew Approach\r\n1. Find eventsPerPartition which would be Math.max(1L, actualNumEvents / minPartitions);\r\n2. Keep computing offsetRanges unless allocatedEvents < actualNumEvents, compute them in a round-robin manner and keep the upper limit of eventsPerPartition messages for each range.\r\n3.  Return all the offsetRanges in the end after sorting them by partition \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo change in public API, the skew in spark task  partitions and bug related to negative remainingPartitions when consuming from Kafka is being fixed.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone, the existing config KafkaSourceConfig.KAFKA_SOURCE_MIN_PARTITIONS is now being used the way it's supposed to be used. \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-14T18:42:09Z","updated_at":"2024-05-01T22:47:06Z","closed_at":"2024-03-15T19:20:53Z","merged_at":"2024-03-15T19:20:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c8488b831c6242f26b5d4bde5d3783c89dcd84e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5693784631,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABU2BCNw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.15.0","name":"release-0.15.0","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6605747796,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABibu2VA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:M","name":"size:M","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":"PR

incremental source (for S3 and GCS) performas an existance check for the object (in the object store). This can be an expensive operation. This can be replaced with two spark session configs: `spark.sql.files.ignoreMissingFiles` and `spark.sql.files.ignoreCorruptFiles`. The documentation for the same can be found in https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-generic-options.html#ignore-missing-files.\r\n\r\nOf specific interest in the documentation is these lines, \"Here, missing file really means the deleted file under directory after you construct the DataFrame.\". This seems to be the case with the existance check in `CloudObjectsSelectorCommon.java`. Specifically, if someone wants to check for the existance of a file while the dataframe itself is being created, then this will not work.\r\n\r\nAdded a test case by simulating file deletions _after_ DataFrame is created in TestCloudObjectsSelectorCommon::ignoreMissingFiles\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\nGcsEventsHoodieIncrSource.java and S3EventsHoodieIncrSource.java\r\nSet the two spark options in sparkSession iff `ENABLE_EXISTS_CHECK` is set in the property. The two options are `spark.sql.files.ignoreMissingFiles` and `spark.sql.files.ignoreCorruptFiles`.\r\n\r\nCloudObjectsSelectorCommon.java:\r\nRemove the call to `checkIfFileExists(...)` when building a URL for a file\r\n\r\nIncrSourceCloudStorageHelper.java:\r\nSet teh same spak options in the sparkSession. These functions do not seem to be used anywhere, but cleaning up the usage of file-existance-check regardless.\r\n\r\nTestCloudObjectsSelectorCommon.java: New test case for the said funtionality\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow. New tests and existing tests should suffice.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-14T09:57:30Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T01:59:28Z","closed_at":"2024-04-23T01:59:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"56cf85427ee8d17c44dd747918c8467471f13463","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2346209364,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzQ2MjA5MzY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/aws-support","name":"aws-support","color":"83b722","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3057625951,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDU3NjI1OTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/gcp-support","name":"gcp-support","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"issues

Due to discrepancy, metadata writer thought there is anew index that needs ot be initialized. This is fixed in `HoodieTableConfig#isMetadataPartitionAvailable`.\r\n2. When a functional index is updated, it fetches latest file slices, including the pending ones, in data partition. There was a typo in building the filesystem view. Instead of passing data meta client, metadata meta client was passed.\r\n\r\nAdded a test which covers both these scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes functional index bugs.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-13T17:31:42Z","updated_at":"2024-04-09T10:54:30Z","closed_at":"2024-04-09T10:54:30Z","merged_at":"2024-04-09T10:54:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"be7120d6d91c1371cb26924c94eb7b3647ff520e","assignee":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2950870088,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTUwODcwMDg4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/index","name":"index","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5167491007,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNAGnvw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-1.0.0","name":"release-1.0.0","color":"E82785","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6605747796,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABibu2VA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:M","name":"size:M","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`ConfigProperty.key()` and `ConfigOption.key()` are used for docs generating, and we need to move towards consistent naming of all parameters in Hudi. This MR proposes the first step, which is changing names of Cleaner configuration parameters only. The following table shows proposed changes.\r\n\r\n| New main key  | Previous key in `HoodieCleanConfig` | Key in `FlinkOptions`, new key as alternative |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| hoodie.clean.automatic | hoodie.clean.automatic |  |\r\n| hoodie.clean.async.enabled | hoodie.clean.async | clean.async.enabled |\r\n| hoodie.clean.multiple.enabled | hoodie.clean.allow.multiple |  |\r\n| hoodie.clean.incremental.enabled | hoodie.cleaner.incremental.mode |  |\r\n| hoodie.clean.parallelism | hoodie.cleaner.parallelism |  |\r\n| hoodie.clean.policy | hoodie.cleaner.policy | clean.policy |\r\n| hoodie.clean.commits.retained | hoodie.cleaner.commits.retained | clean.retain_commits |\r\n| hoodie.clean.fileversions.retained | hoodie.cleaner.fileversions.retained | clean.retain_file_versions |\r\n| hoodie.clean.hours.retained | hoodie.cleaner.hours.retained | clean.retain_hours |\r\n| hoodie.clean.trigger.strategy | hoodie.clean.trigger.strategy |  |\r\n| hoodie.clean.trigger.max.commits | hoodie.clean.max.commits |  |\r\n| hoodie.clean.delete.bootstrap.base.file | hoodie.cleaner.delete.bootstrap.base.file |  |\r\n| hoodie.clean.failed.writes.policy | hoodie.cleaner.policy.failed.writes |  |\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have about 900+ parameters in Hudi, as I mentioned in [HUDI-5738](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5738). Note, that my table in [HUDI-5738](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5738) contains only 899 of them, and missed, for instance, recently added TTL parameters.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nTo save backward compatibility, old keys are available, which is done by using `ConfigProperty.withAlternatives(\"...\")` for `HoodieCleanConfig`. To support new keys in `FlinkOptions`, they are added as `ConfigOption.withFallbackKeys(\"...\")`.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nCorresponding MR with updates to the `current` version of docs - [MR 10856](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/10856).\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

this RFC, we propose implementing Secondary Indexes (SI), a new capability in Hudi's metadata table (MDT) based indexing system.  SI are indexes defined on user specified columns of the table. Similar to record level indexes, SI will improve query performance when the query predicate contains secondary keys. The number of files that a query needs to scan can be pruned down using secondary indexes.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nNew RFC\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation of `HoodieSchemaUtils.deduceWriterSchema` is really complicated with many flags used in one place.\r\nTo figure out how this method is working, we need to draw directed acyclic graph. Here the current implementation:\r\n![before_refactoring](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/67073364/15507db6-92f4-4dd3-86e9-c4fa4b3c05ab)\r\n\r\nYellow is used for marking of flags, and purple is used for marking of returned schemas or exceptions.\r\n\r\nWe couldn't remove any of the used flags without changing processing logic. The only possibility is to refactor `deduceWriterSchema()` for simplification, and preparing for future removing of deprecated `hoodie.datasource.write.reconcile.schema`.\r\n\r\nThis MR proposes to consider the following changed processing schema:\r\n![after_refactoring](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/67073364/97683b54-edfb-4941-a9e9-e92a0fe34066)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRefactored `HoodieSchemaUtils.deduceWriterSchema`.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo need.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

The semantics are unclear. In fact, it is not the first 100 error messages， but the first10 file errors.\r\n2. The printing positions of partition and global exception are reversed. \r\nAnd if there is no global exception, there is no need to print null.\r\n4. Row-level exceptions. Although they are printed in the trace,  the online data traffic is usually very large,  so it is not wise to print them all.\r\n\r\nSo, I modified it to print the first 10 files with write exceptions\r\nThen print global exceptions and row-level exceptions as needed,  and if there are row-level exceptions,  only print the first 100 exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR splits tests in CI further to reduce total CI elapsed time:\r\n- GitHub Java CI: splits the spark tests into two jobs, one for Java tests only and the other for Scala tests only (`test-spark` -> `test-spark-java-tests` and `test-spark-scala-tests`, `test-spark-java17` -> `test-spark-java17-java-tests` and `test-spark-java17-scala-tests`).  This roughly cuts the total time of `test-spark` from ~2h to ~70min after parallelizing.\r\n- Azure CI: splits the job 3, `UT spark-datasource`, which takes ~3h, into two jobs, one for Java tests only (`Java UT spark-datasource`) and the other for Scala tests only (`Scala UT spark-datasource`), so after parallelizing, Azure CI takes ~2h to finish.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement added in this PR is to build only the necessary modules in Job 2-5 in Azure CI (we keep the full build in Job 1 to make sure all modules are buildable).\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n- Github Java CI wait time: ~70min\r\n<img
