issue resolved #2150\r\n\r\nIn some cases using the query builder API to create a query/update could result in an apparently valid query (when printing as a string) but the actual AST was bad.  When attempting to actually execute the query/update locally ARQ would fail to compile it as a result.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes BuildElementVisitor to avoid an oversimplification of some AST elements, specifically an ElementGroup containing a single ElementFilter that was leading to the bad AST.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [ ] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ] Commits have been squashed to remove

issue resolved #2039 \r\nThis closes #2126\r\nThis closes #2051\r\n\r\nThis PR makes language tags case insensitive.  This is mandated in RDF 1.2. In RDF 1.1, and before, language tags only had to be treated as case-insensitive values.\r\n\r\nInternally, language tags are formatted using the light-weight algorithm in [RFC 5646, section 2.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646#section-2.1.1). It does not validate language tags.\r\n\r\n`\"abc\"@en` and `\"abc\"@EN` become the same RDF term.\r\n\r\n`LANG` returns formatted language tags.\r\ne.g. `en`, `en-GB`, `en-Latn-GB`\r\n\r\nThe PR also includes the node machinery for initial text direction (RDF 1.2). It does not include API or SPARQL support.\r\n\r\nLanguage tag validation during parsing may be added later.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to

issue resolved #2094\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\n* Add field grouping (parens) to composeQField method to fix #2094 \r\n\r\nI see a similar fix with parens is also used in other paths in the code for example in line 765 and 771 of the same file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   qString = \"(\" + qString + \") AND \" + (!lang.equals(\"none\") ? langField+\":\"+lang : \"-\"+langField+\":*\");\r\n            log.trace(\"query$ ADDING LANG qString: {} \", qString) ;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  if (graphURI != null) {\r\n            String escaped = QueryParserBase.escape(graphURI) ;\r\n            qString = \"(\" + qString + \") AND \" + getDocDef().getGraphField() + \":\" + escaped ;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n*  Add a unique set to remove duplicate query clauses on propLists which is mentioned by @rvesse \r\n\r\n> It also looks like we generate duplicate query clauses when multiple properties map to the same Lucene field which might be unnecessary?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests

request Description:\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nTests like `org.apache.jena.query.TestParameterizedSparqlString#test_param_string_injection_10` makes more than one injections. `ParameterizedSparqlString.getVars()` is used to retrieve the order of injections, `getVars()` calls `this.params.keySet().iterator()` on the `ParameterizedSparqlString` object and the implementation of `params` of `ParameterizedSparqlString` is a `HashMap` which does not guarantee the order.

order.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/jena/blob/fc01d33e6c11eed68784f820bf2dd161868d1d37/jena-arq/src/main/java/org/apache/jena/query/ParameterizedSparqlString.java#L1138\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/jena/blob/fc01d33e6c11eed68784f820bf2dd161868d1d37/jena-arq/src/main/java/org/apache/jena/query/ParameterizedSparqlString.java#L141\r\n\r\n###

...\r\n```\r\nThe root cause is that two threads simultaneously called `QueryEngineRegistry.get()` for the first time.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the old initialization code in `QueryEngineRegistry` looks ok because `init()` is called during class loading:\r\n```\r\npublic class QueryEngineRegistry\r\n{\r\n    List<QueryEngineFactory> factories = new ArrayList<>();\r\n    static { init(); }        <========== THIS LOOKS LIKE IT SAFELY INITIALIZES THE REGISTRY\r\n\r\n    // Singleton\r\n    static QueryEngineRegistry registry = null; <===== EXCEPT THIS EXECUTES AFTER init() AND CLEARS THE REGISTRY!\r\n    static public QueryEngineRegistry get()\r\n    {\r\n        if ( registry == null )\r\n            init();\r\n        return registry;  <===== THIS PATTERN IS NOT THREAD-SAFE, CAN EXPOSE PARTIALLY-INITIALIZED REGISTRY\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private QueryEngineRegistry() { }\r\n\r\n    private static synchronized void init()\r\n    {\r\n        registry = new QueryEngineRegistry();\r\n        registry.add(QueryEngineMain.getFactory());\r\n        registry.add(QueryEngineFactoryWrapper.get());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if you run the static initialize blocks sequentially, you'll see that things can progress in the following order:\r\n1. Class initialization calls `init()` and sets `registry` to a valid object.\r\n2. Class initialization executes `registry = null;`\r\n3. The first call to `QueryEngineFactory.get()` sees `registry == null` and makes a second call to `init()`\r\n4. The first line of `init()` sets `registry` to an empty object.\r\n5. Before the second line `init()` executes, a concurrent call to `QueryEngineFactory.get()` sees `registry != null` and tries to use an empty registry.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the static call to `init()` and removes unnecessary lazy initialization logic from `get()`.\r\n* As far as I can tell, the only risk with simplifying `get()` would be if some other class did `QueryEngineRegistry.registry = null`, forcing the class to re-initialize itself. None of the existing Jena code does that but, to be sure, this PR changes the `static QueryEngineRegistry registry` field to `private`.\r\n* It would also be nice to make the field `final`. But that's safe only if we can guarantee that `QueryEngineRegistry.init()` will never call back into `QueryEngineRegistry.get()` via the method calls to `QueryEngineMain` or `QueryEngineFactoryWrapper`, and I didn't want to make that assumption. If it's ok to assume that, I'd be happy to update the PR to use `final`.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [ ] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ] Documentation change and updates are provided for the [Apache Jena

is a pull request for the Jena5 cycle with issues as noted in the commit messages.\r\n\r\nIt is _not_ for merging into main. \r\n\r\nThe best way forward is probably to create a \"jena5\" branch for now, keeping \"main\" as Jena 4.x.x until quite near to release Jena5 in some form.\r\n\r\nTo be safe, I've created the \"jena5\" branch and targeted this PR at it. This reduces the chance of accidentally getting material onto \"main\".\r\n\r\nThere is more work to do but this would give everyone a chance to see what is proposed and also contribute their own
