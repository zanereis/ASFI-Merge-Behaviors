Historical Resource which uses SegmentManager to process SegmentChangeRequests\n\nChanges in Coordinator - \n1) Abstract out LoadQueuePeon which handles  load/unload queue and priority for load/unload. \n2) ZKLoadQueuePeon uses zookeeper to process SegmentChangeRequests \n3) HttpLoadQueuePeon uses the new http end-points for segment management\n4) Introduce new config \"druid.coordinator.load.peon.type\" which can be set to \"zk\" or \"http\" (default is http)\n\nTODO: \n1) Add unit tests for new endpoints and HttpLoadQueuePeon  \n2) Add docs\n","created_at":"2016-02-02T13:41:47Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:35:29Z","closed_at":"2017-09-08T15:20:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4dbd48d9c499330995a017bd362eb7bb7802861b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":182900868,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODI5MDA4Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Discuss","name":"Discuss","color":"ff00ff","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/1b55a8ad170f564f1026695554115140016430c3","head":{"label":"metamx:http-segment-assignment","ref":"http-segment-assignment","sha":"1b55a8ad170f564f1026695554115140016430c3","user":{"login":"metamx","id":299329,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5OTMyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28248872,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODI0ODg3Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"metamx/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"metamx","id":299329,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5OTMyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/metamx/druid","description":"RealÂ²time

_ProtoBufInputRowParser_ always parses only the first protobuf message.\nNow, it has the same behaviour by default and in addition can parse any message if you define message name with package in the \"message\" attribute.\n\nConfig example\n\n> \"parser\":{\n>               \"type\":\"protobuf\",\n>               \"parseSpec\":{\n>                   \"format\": \"json\",\n>                   \"timestampSpec\":{...},\n>                   \"dimensionsSpec\": {\n>                       \"dimensions\":[...]\n>                   }\n>               },\n>               \"descriptor\": \"...\",\n>               **\"message\"**: \"prototest.ProtoTestEventWithMessages\"\n>           },\n> ....\n\n**2.** _ProtoBufInputRowParser_ doesn't parse embedded DynamicMessage. Thus it is not possible to parse any complex message which aggregates other messages or collections of messages.\n\nNow you can defile a deep chain access to messages and their fields using \".\" as a separator between parent field and child field.\nExample of valid dimensions:\n\n> \"id\", \"description\",\n>           \"location.country\", \"location.state\", \"location.city\", \"location.zipcode\",\n>           \"income.income\", \"income.currency\", \"income.occupationType\",\n>           \"interests.interestName\", \"interests.subInterestNames\", \"interests.interestCode.code\"\n\nSince druid supports first level multi-value columns you can get a list of values from desizered path from the collection of similar messages\nExample: interests.subInterestNames will return a list of values\n\nPlease let me know if you will need more information about this

druid doesn't have any reference manager to register or delete `LookupExtractor` objects.\nAlso Currently the only way to use `Lookup` extraction type user has to wrap it around an `ExtractionFn`, this is very verbose and make optimization very painful (Lookup exposes unapply and extraction function does not).\nThis PR:\n1 - Introduces a `LookupExtractorFactory` instance manager called `LookupReferencesManager` allowing basic operations to register/un-register/listAll or remove `LookupExtractorFactory` instances.\n2 - Provides an implementation of `LookupExtractor` that delegates the lookup functionality to a registered lookup. This implementation is set to be by default, so any query that comes with actual namespace it will try to use the `LookupReferencesManager`\n3 - Defines a new way to use Lookup directly via an implementation of `DimensionSpec` called `LookupDimensionSpec`\n4 - `LookupExtractorFactory` will manage the lifecycle and the state of LookupExtractor.\n5 - Adds to `LookupExtractor` the property `isOneToOne` to enable optimization at the broker level.\n6 - Does not introduce any performance changes.\nFYI: We decided to move away from `LookupExtractionFn` in favor of implementing `DimensionSpec` and use the lookup delegator to do the apply/unapply. \nThis has couple of advantages, lookups become less verbose, and optimaztion more easy to check for.\nThe fact that `LookupExtractor` exposes methods that are not included at the `ExtractionFn` API it doesn't make sense to use lookups via `ExtractionFN` API.\nHere is a overview of the overall roadmap of [QTL development ](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/2328)

extension is proposed as a means for \"capability\" discovery.  For this discussion any specific capability is a group of resources which can be defined by IDs and are essentially cluster-wide resources (resource with unique id across all of cluster)\n\nThe most notable example of things which would fit under \"capability\" are \n- Serving deep storage Segments for querying\n- Lookup namespaces used in querying\n- Tasks (maybe?)\n\nThis PR proposes a different paradigm for such items such that all services which can host capacity based on IDs can guarantee a very basic post/get/delete. Any extra functionality beyond a simple post/get/delete is not _guaranteed_ by this paradigm, but any implementation may wish to expose a SEPARATE endpoint with the expanded functionality. An such an implementation is encouraged to use the mechanisms in this PR for capability discovery.\n\nThis PR uses ZK/Curator ServiceDiscovery to _find_ the instances with a capability, and relies on http REST calls to manage the post/get/deletes to the instances.\n\nThis PR does not have any concept of state, and any particular implementation is expected to manage its own state and maintain its own reconciliation expectations on cluster state conflicts.\n\nAn example of a use case can be seen in https://github.com/metamx/druid/blob/queryTimeLookup_announce/extensions/namespace-lookup/src/main/java/io/druid/server/namespace/NamespacedExtractionModule.java#L262\n\nTODO:\n- ~~Reconcile this PR with https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/2242~~ ( see https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/2242#issuecomment-173422790 )\n- ~~Annotate the curator stuff so that a different ZK can be used at some point.~~ Will use #2242 instead when it is ready\n- Ensure accommodation of

suggest that if the info message \"No chathandler detected\" were changed to a warning, it might help people figure out what's wrong if they are using tranquility but have

has gone back to being noop.\n\nWhat reason is there for setting the type to noop?  I wonder if maybe it should be an error if that is done.\n\nThe history seems to be that the default was originally noop, then became announce

PR updates IncrementalIndex such that it can ingest and store Long/Float dimensions in addition to Strings. It is intended as a step towards the larger goals being discussed in the following topic:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/druid-development/obtfNJnXPDg/discussion\n- DimDim is now a generic class instead of assuming String values. The TimeAndDims grouping key class now stores dimension values as Comparable[] instead of String[].\n- The PR does not change the DimensionSelector or *Adapter interfaces to support non-String types, so query/index persist behavior is unchanged, nor does this PR provide a way for the user to specify non-String dimension types in the ingestion schema. \n- Schema-less dimension type discovery is not enabled in the PR (newly discovered dims are assumed to be Strings). \n- The PR includes a JMH benchmark that adds rows with Long/Float/String columns to an IncrementalIndex.\n\nI ran the row-adding benchmark with type discovery enabled for testing purposes and the numbers are shown below:\n\n```\njava -jar target/benchmarks.jar IncrementalIndexAddRowsBenchmark -f 1 -i 20 -wi 10\n```\n\nWith patch, non-String dims:\n\n```\nRun complete.

#2106 suggests, the way how zero-filling works seems not to meet someone's expectation. some people might expect that the result with zero-filling is continuous in a timeseries even when there are absent data points here and there.\n\nThis PR makes use of uncovered intervals refering PR #2058 to find out which intervals are absent.(However, I am aware of the fact that there is still a ambiguous point about what's the meaning of absence of data segments refering #2058 conversations). \n\nI wrote code just working right now and please check its usefulness, then I will write test code or

PR fixes https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/2040\n\n(1) makes Druid nodes(Historical, Realtime, Overlord, Coordinator,MiddleManager, Broker) use Announcer for internal announcements. In Zookeeper you can find all Druid nodes' announcement under `/druid/announcement` (assuming announcements path base is `/druid`)\n\nNow under `/druid/announcement`, there'll be \n\n```\n[historical, realtime, middleManager, coordinator, broker, overlord]\n```\n- All Druid nodes announce themselves directly under `/druid/announcement/{type}`\n\n(3) Introduce \"capability\" concept inside Druid. For example, historical and realtime nodes have the capability of serving segments, at startup, they will announce this capability under `/druid/announcement/capability`\n\n(4) Use [DruidServerDiscovery](https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/2242/files#diff-ac5f1e029209e351f7fe52c027ca14c4R30) for internal Druid server discovery. This interface allows us not rely on Zookeeper to discover/distribute internal Druid server information.\n\n(5) Allow Druid to make announcements on an external zookeeper host, which is set by `druid.zk.service.externalHost`\n\n(4) adds a ClusterInfoResource to Coordinator so that you can query for Druid nodes information through Coordinator endpoint.\n\nExample:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"router\": [],\n  \"realtime\": [],\n  \"coordinator\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"localhost:8082\",\n      \"host\": \"localhost:8082\",\n      \"maxSize\": 0,\n      \"type\": \"coordinator\",\n      \"tier\": \"_default_tier\",\n      \"priority\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"localhost:9082\",\n      \"host\": \"localhost:9082\",\n      \"maxSize\": 0,\n      \"type\": \"coordinator\",\n      \"tier\": \"_default_tier\",\n      \"priority\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"historical\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"localhost:8081\",\n      \"host\": \"localhost:8081\",\n      \"maxSize\": 50000000000,\n      \"type\": \"historical\",\n      \"tier\": \"_default_tier\",\n      \"priority\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"localhost:9081\",\n      \"host\": \"localhost:9081\",\n      \"maxSize\": 50000000000,\n      \"type\": \"historical\",\n      \"tier\": \"second_tier\",\n      \"priority\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"broker\": [],\n  \"overlord\": [\n
