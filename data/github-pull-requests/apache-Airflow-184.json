DockerOperator by default mounts temporary folder to inside\r\nthe container in order to allow to store files bigger than\r\ndefault size of disk for the container, however this did not work\r\nwhen remote Docker engine or Docker-In-Docker solution was used.\r\n\r\nThis worked before the #15843 change, because the /tmp has\r\nbeen ignored, however when we change to \"Mounts\", the \"/tmp\"\r\nmount fails when using remote docker engine.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds parameter that allows to disable this temporary\r\ndirectory mounting (and adds a note that it can be replaced\r\nwith mounting existing volumes). Also it prints a warning\r\nif the directory cannot be mounted and attempts to re-run\r\nsuch failed attempt without mounting the temporary\r\ndirectory which brings back backwards-compatible behaviour\r\nfor remote engines and docker-in-docker.\r\n\r\nFixes: #16803\r\nFixes: #16806\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR closes #16669.\r\n\r\n**Why:**\r\n\r\nAuthentication by personal token was not working properly since the Tableau provider's creation due to how the Tableau server client works (it invalidates previous personal token connection if one or more parallel are opened). Therefore, we decided to deprecate it.\r\n\r\n*Changes:*\r\n\r\n1. Remove `_auth_via_token` method from the `TableauHook` and make the documentation notes about the deprecation.\r\n2. Fix `get_all` method of `TableauHook` to raise a  verbose error when there is wrong object type was supplied.\r\n3. Deprecate the usage of `TableauJobStatusSensor` in case of blocking `TableauRefreshWorkbookOperator` execution to remove the creation of duplicated connection (which is done by a sensor) and to improve the conformity of the class to SRP. Also fix some small documentation issues.\r\n4. Deprecate testing of the personal token authentication and add change the logic of \"blocked\" task test.","created_at":"2021-07-09T19:25:22Z","updated_at":"2021-07-15T06:29:32Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T06:29:32Z","merged_at":"2021-07-15T06:29:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"53246ebef716933f71a28901e19367d84b0daa81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?

PR closes the #16836 and is related to #12315\r\n\r\n**Why:**\r\n\r\nThere was an inconsistency in the UI where the presence of XCOM value was checked by `elif item[value] != None`. That caused a failure in XCOMs view when the user was trying to return not castable to bool XCOM objects (e.g. pandas data frames). Moreover, the method of comparison is not recommended by PEP8:\r\n\r\n```Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with is or is not, never the equality operators.```\r\n\r\nThe bug was uncovered by @turbaszek but was not fixed for some reason (probably due to the focus change).\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n\r\nChange the comparison operator from `!=` to `is not`, which is recommended approach.","created_at":"2021-07-08T19:19:01Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T14:23:09Z","closed_at":"2021-07-12T14:23:07Z","merged_at":"2021-07-12T14:23:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"dcc7fb56708773e929f742c7c8463fb8e91e7340","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay to merge","color":"64e05c","default":false,"description":"It's ok to merge this PR as it does not require more tests"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

default `docker-compose.yaml` file exposes Redis to the host by specifying port mapping of `6379:6379`.\r\n\r\nSince Redis is unauthenticated by default and runs as root, this poses a risk and will likely be overlooked by users deploying Airflow using docker compose in VPSes or other instances that are publicly facing, even though it's not meant for production use.\r\n\r\nI could not find a reason to have Redis be accessible through the host, so I'm proposing to restrict this port from being accessible via the hypervisor.\r\n\r\nRedis can be made to write files into the file system using techniques such as [CONFIG SET](https://redis.io/commands/config-set), on a VPS, this will result in a system compromise by a bot within a few hours if not minutes.

PR adds a new provider to Airflow for executing SQL queries against an Apache Drill instance.  This is useful because, while its primary use case is interactive analysis that often avoids the need for ETL, Drill's CTAS statements and support for querying a large variety of data sources also make it a very capable ETL tool.  What is lacking to use Drill this way is worklow management, and that gap is one that Airflow fills perfectly.","created_at":"2021-07-08T11:00:35Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T18:32:08Z","closed_at":"2021-07-12T17:59:35Z","merged_at":"2021-07-12T17:59:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"8808b641942e1b81c21db054fd6d36e2031cfab8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

to #10285\r\n\r\n- Updated example DAG files such that `xcom_pull()` calls use an operator's `.output` property\r\n- Added comments to which task dependencies, if any, are handled and/or created via `XComArgs` for transparency\r\n- Removed or refactored the `default_args` pattern where necessary as requested by @ashb (i.e. removed a separated `default_args` declaration for deference for declaration as part of the `DAG` object)\r\n- Other miscellaneous updates based on `.output` refactoring\r\n\r\n>**Note:** There are several instances where the `xcom_pull()` call was not updated.  These instances involve accessing a specific value within the `XCom` or calling user-defined macros with an `XCom` value.  Reference #16618 for an open issue to enhance the `XComArg` functionality to provide similar behavior as the classic `xcom_pull()` method.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Not all DAGs were tested functionally (i.e. with hard integrations to source systems and executed), however each DAG was tested to compile and generate a DAG graph as expected locally.\r\n\r\nAn detailed summary of all changes made as part of this PR can be found below:\r\n| DAG File | Converted `xcom_pull()`? | Other Updates? | Comments |\r\n| ---------| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------- |\r\n| airflow/providers/google/leveldb/example_dags/example_leveldb.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/providers/google/marketing_platform/example_dags/example_campaign_manager.py | No | No | Current `XComArg` object does not support accessing specific values of an iterable `XCom` value elegantly.

to #10285\r\n\r\n- Updated example DAG files such that `xcom_pull()` calls use an operator's `.output` property as well access of `TaskInstance` objects from context to use `get_current_context()` function\r\n- Added comments to which task dependencies, if any, are handled and/or created via `XComArgs` for transparency\r\n- Removed or refactored the `default_args` pattern where necessary as requested by @ashb (i.e. removed a separated `default_args` declaration for deference for declaration as part of the `DAG` object)\r\n- Other miscellaneous updates based on `.output` refactoring\r\n\r\n>**Note:** There are several instances where the `xcom_pull()` call was not updated.  These instances involve accessing a specific value within the `XCom` or calling user-defined macros with an `XCom` value.  Reference #16618 for an open issue to enhance the `XComArg` functionality to provide similar behavior as the classic `xcom_pull()` method.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Not all DAGs were tested functionally (i.e. with hard integrations to source systems and executed), however each DAG was tested to compile and generate a DAG graph as expected locally.\r\n\r\nAn detailed summary of all changes made as part of this PR can be found below:\r\n| DAG File | Converted `xcom_pull()`? | Other Updates? | Comments |\r\n| ---------| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------- |\r\n| airflow/providers/google/cloud/example_dags/example_automl_nl_text_classification.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`. |\r\n| airflow/providers/google/cloud/example_dags/example_automl_nl_text_extraction.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`. |\r\n| airflow/providers/google/cloud/example_dags/example_automl_nl_text_sentiment.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`. |\r\n| airflow/providers/google/cloud/example_dags/example_automl_tables.py | Yes ** | Yes | ** Current `XComArg` object does not support accessing specific values of an iterable `XCom` value elegantly.

to #10285\r\n\r\n- Updated example DAG files such that `xcom_pull()` calls use an operator's `.output` property\r\n- Added comments to which task dependencies, if any, are handled and/or created via `XComArgs` for transparency\r\n- Removed or refactored the `default_args` pattern where necessary as requested by @ashb (i.e. removed a separated `default_args` declaration for deference for declaration as part of the `DAG` object)\r\n- Other miscellaneous updates based on `.output` refactoring\r\n\r\n>**Note:** There are several instances where the `xcom_pull()` call was not updated.  These instances involve accessing a specific value within the `XCom` or calling user-defined macros with an `XCom` value.  Reference #16618 for an open issue to enhance the `XComArg` functionality to provide similar behavior as the classic `xcom_pull()` method.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Not all DAGs were tested functionally (i.e. with hard integrations to source systems and executed), however each DAG was tested to compile and generate a DAG graph as expected locally.\r\n\r\nAn detailed summary of all changes made as part of this PR can be found below:\r\n| DAG File | Converted `xcom_pull()`? | Other Updates? | Comments |\r\n| ---------| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------- |\r\n| airflow/providers/jenkins/example_dags/example_jenkins_job_trigger.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`. </br></br>Refactored `grab_artifact_from_jenkins()` function to take an input `XComArgs` from a previous task. </br></br>Refactored `default_args` pattern. |\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead

to #10285\r\n\r\n- Updated example DAG files such that `xcom_pull()` calls use an operator's `.output` property as well access of `TaskInstance` objects from context to use `get_current_context()` function\r\n- Added comments to which task dependencies, if any, are handled and/or created via `XComArgs` for transparency\r\n- Removed or refactored the `default_args` pattern where necessary as requested by @ashb (i.e. removed a separated `default_args` declaration for deference for declaration as part of the `DAG` object)\r\n- Other miscellaneous updates based on `.output` refactoring\r\n\r\n>**Note:** There are several instances where the `xcom_pull()` call was not updated.  These instances involve accessing a specific value within the `XCom` or calling user-defined macros with an `XCom` value.  Reference #16618 for an open issue to enhance the `XComArg` functionality to provide similar behavior as the classic `xcom_pull()` method.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Not all DAGs were tested functionally (i.e. with hard integrations to source systems and executed), however each DAG was tested to compile and generate a DAG graph as expected locally.\r\n\r\nAn detailed summary of all changes made as part of this PR can be found below:\r\n| DAG File | Converted `xcom_pull()`? | Other Updates? | Comments |\r\n| ---------| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------- |\r\n| airflow/providers/docker/example_dags/example_docker_copy_data.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`. <br/><br/>Refactored `default_args` pattern.

to #10285\r\n\r\n- Updated example DAG files such that `xcom_pull()` calls use an operator's `.output` property\r\n- Added comments to which task dependencies, if any, are handled and/or created via `XComArgs` for transparency\r\n- Removed or refactored the `default_args` pattern where necessary as requested by @ashb (i.e. removed a separated `default_args` declaration for deference for declaration as part of the `DAG` object)\r\n\r\n>**Note:** There are several instances where the `xcom_pull()` call was not updated.  These instances involve accessing a specific value within the `XCom` or calling user-defined macros with an `XCom` value.  Reference #16618 for an open issue to enhance the `XComArg` functionality to provide similar behavior as the classic `xcom_pull()` method.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Not all DAGs were tested functionally (i.e. with hard integrations to source systems and executed), however each DAG was tested to compile and generate a DAG graph as expected locally.\r\n\r\nAn detailed summary of all changes made as part of this PR can be found below:\r\n| DAG File | Converted `xcom_pull()`? | Other Updates? | Comments |\r\n| ---------| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------- |\r\n| airflow/providers/apache/beam/example_dags/example_beam.py | No | No | Current `XComArg` object does not support accessing specific values of an iterable `XCom` value elegantly.

to #10285\r\n\r\n- Updated example DAG files such that `xcom_pull()` calls use an operator's `.output` property as well access of `TaskInstance` objects from context to use `get_current_context()` function\r\n- Added comments to which task dependencies, if any, are handled and/or created via `XComArgs` for transparency\r\n- Removed or refactored the `default_args` pattern where necessary as requested by @ashb (i.e. removed a separated `default_args` declaration for deference for declaration as part of the `DAG` object)\r\n\r\n>**Note:** There are several instances where the `xcom_pull()` call was not updated.  These instances involve accessing a specific value within the `XCom` or calling user-defined macros with an `XCom` value.  Reference #16618 for an open issue to enhance the `XComArg` functionality to provide similar behavior as the classic `xcom_pull()` method.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Not all DAGs were tested functionally (i.e. with hard integrations to source systems and executed), however each DAG was tested to compile and generate a DAG graph as expected locally.\r\n\r\nAn detailed summary of all changes made as part of this PR can be found below:\r\n| DAG File | Converted `xcom_pull()`? | Other Updates? | Comments |\r\n| ---------| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------- |\r\n| airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_dms_full_load_task.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`.</br></br>Refactored  `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_dms_full_load_task.py | No | Yes | Refactored  `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_emr_job_flow_automatic_steps.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`. </br></br>Refactored  `default_args` pattern. |\r\nairflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_emr_job_flow_manual_steps.py |  Yes ** | Yes | ** Current `XComArg` object does not support accessing specific values of an iterable `XCom` value elegantly.

to #10285\r\n\r\n- Updated example DAG files such that `xcom_pull()` calls use an operator's `.output` property\r\n- Added comments to which task dependencies, if any, are handled and/or created via `XComArgs` for transparency\r\n- Removed or refactored the `default_args` pattern where necessary as requested by @ashb (i.e. removed a separated `default_args` declaration for deference for declaration as part of the `DAG` object)\r\n\r\n>**Note:** There are several instances where the `xcom_pull()` call was not updated.  These instances involve accessing a specific value within the `XCom` or calling user-defined macros with an `XCom` value.  Reference #16618 for an open issue to enhance the `XComArg` functionality to provide similar behavior as the classic `xcom_pull()` method.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Not all DAGs were tested functionally (i.e. with hard integrations to source systems and executed), however each DAG was tested to compile and generate a DAG graph as expected locally.\r\n\r\nAn detailed summary of all changes made as part of this PR can be found below:\r\n| DAG File | Converted `xcom_pull()`? | Other Updates? | Comments |\r\n| ---------| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------- |\r\n| airflow/providers/airbyte/example_dags/example_airbyte_trigger_job.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`.<br/><br/>Removed unneeded `default_args`

to #10285\r\n\r\n- Removed or refactored the `default_args` pattern where necessary as requested by @ashb (i.e. removed a separated `default_args` declaration for deference for declaration as part of the `DAG` object)\r\n- Updated example DAG files such that `xcom_pull()` calls use an operator's `.output` property as well access of `TaskInstance` objects from context to use `get_current_context()` function\r\n- Added comments to which task dependencies, if any, are handled and/or created via `XComArgs` for transparency\r\n\r\nAn detailed summary of all changes made as part of this PR can be

Previously the tests were using the method `_create_dag_models` to generate test DAGs and when I changed to use the same DAGs from the tests on `TestGetDagDetails` the tests started failing because of tags for instance and then I noticed that tags are defined differently on `dag_schema` and `dag_detail_schema` and I felt like I needed to update `dag_schema` to use the same configuration. \r\n\r\nThere is also the behavior that using DAGs from DagBag instead of directly inserting a DagModel on the database through the session the attributes `is_paused` and `is_active` come up as None instead of False/True.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I noticed is that on TestGetDag there is a test related to the details endpoint [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/tests/api_connexion/endpoints/test_dag_endpoint.py#L204).

#10285\r\n\r\n- Updated example DAG files such that `xcom_pull()` calls use an operator's `.output` property as well access of `TaskInstance` objects from context to use `get_current_context()` function\r\n- Added comments to which task dependencies, if any, are handled and/or created via `XComArgs` for transparency\r\n- Removed or refactored the `default_args` pattern where necessary as requested by @ashb (i.e. removed a separated `default_args` declaration for deference for declaration as part of the `DAG` object)\r\n- Other miscellaneous updates based on `.output` refactoring\r\n\r\n>**Note:** There are several instances where the `xcom_pull()` call was not updated.  These instances involve accessing a specific value within the `XCom` or calling user-defined macros with an `XCom` value.  Reference #16618 for an open issue to enhance the `XComArg` functionality to provide similar behavior as the classic `xcom_pull()` method.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** Not all DAGs were tested functionally (i.e. with hard integrations to source systems and executed), however each DAG was tested to compile and generate a DAG graph as expected locally.\r\n\r\nAn detailed summary of all changes made as part of this PR can be found below:\r\n| DAG File | Converted `xcom_pull()`? | Other Updates? | Comments |\r\n| ---------| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------- |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_bash_operator.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_branch_datetime_operator.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_branch_day_of_week_operator.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_branch_operator.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_branch_python_dop_operator_3.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_dag_decorator.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_kubernetes_executor_config.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_kubernetes_executor.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_passing_params_via_test_command.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_python_operator.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_python_operator.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_short_circuit_operator.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_skip_dag.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_trigger_controller_dag.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_trigger_target_dag.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. </br></br>Updated to use `get_current_context()`.|\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_xcom.py | Yes | Yes | Included examples for context retrieval using `get_current_context()` based on previous PR comments to show new and old means of `XCom` access.<br/><br/>Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`. <br/><br/>Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/example_xcomargs.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/tutorial_etl_dag.py | No | No | Not updated based on earlier comment to keep this file unchanged during initial PR. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/tutorial_taskflow_api_etl_virtualenv.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/example_dags/tutorial_taskflow_api_etl.py | No | Yes | Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/providers/airbyte/example_dags/example_airbyte_trigger_job.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`.<br/><br/>Removed unneeded `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_dms_full_load_task.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`.</br></br>Refactored  `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_dms_full_load_task.py | No | Yes | Refactored  `default_args` pattern. |\r\n| airflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_emr_job_flow_automatic_steps.py | Yes | Yes | Removed explicit task dependencies that are created via `XComArgs`. </br></br>Refactored  `default_args` pattern. |\r\nairflow/providers/amazon/aws/example_dags/example_emr_job_flow_manual_steps.py |  Yes ** | Yes | ** Current `XComArg` object does not support accessing specific values of an iterable `XCom` value elegantly.

change allows specifying queues while using the DaskExecutor to route tasks to specific subsets of workers. Tests and docs updated.\r\n\r\nThis can introduce breaking changes, since with this change if the dask workers are not started with complementary resources to match the specified queues, it will now result in an AirflowException, whereas before it would have just ignored the queue argument. I think this is an acceptable breaking change since it reduces ambiguity in how the DAGs are executed.\r\n\r\ncloses:

PR adds the possibility to set [specific Glue job properties for a run instance](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/glue.html#Glue.Client.start_job_run) of an `AwsGlueJobOperator` without the need to recreate or update the  job.\r\nFollows the same approach of the existing `create_job_kwargs` argument.\r\n\r\nThis is really useful because you can use the same job with different profiles.\r\n\r\nE.g: you can specify a different timeout (`Timeout`) and size (`WorkerType` / `NumberOfWorkers`) for a given table.\r\n```python\r\n# ...\r\nfrom airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.glue import AwsGlueJobOperator\r\n# ...\r\nscript_args = {\r\n    \"--timestamp\": \"{{ ts }}\",\r\n    \"--table\": job_table,\r\n}\r\nrun_job_kwargs = {\r\n    \"Timeout\": job_timeout,\r\n    \"NumberOfWorkers\": job_workers,\r\n    \"WorkerType\": job_workers_type,\r\n}\r\n\r\nupsert_table = AwsGlueJobOperator(\r\n    task_id=\"upsert_table\",\r\n    job_name=\"upsert-table\",\r\n    script_args=script_args,\r\n    run_job_kwargs=run_job_kwargs,\r\n)\r\n# ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Breeze to use Github Container Registry\r\n    \r\nBreeze used traditionally DockerHub to pull images, because\r\nthey were public and GitHub Packages were not. With GitHub Container\r\nRegisry however, we can switch fully to using GitHub Container\r\nRegistry also for Breeze.\r\n\r\nThanks to moving to Github Container Registry we can remove\r\na lot of code responsible for maintaining different naming\r\nand different versions of the images in DockerHub and\r\nGitHub Container Registry. Also it streamlines and simplifies\r\nthe process of refreshing the images when new python versions\r\nare released - the CI push builds will check if the new Python\r\nimage is released in DockerHub and it will rebuild the base\r\nimage automatically if needed (and push it as cache)\r\n\r\nThe CI documentation (including sequence diagrams) has been\r\nrefreshed to reflect those changes (and other changes done in\r\nthe meantime). The flows are now simplified as DockerHub is\r\nlargely moved out of the picture.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining DockerHub Images now are:\r\n\r\n* images used during CI for integrations (airflow-ci)\r\n* officially released Production Airflow images (airflow)\r\n\r\nThe integration images will be moved to GitHub Container Registry\r\nin a subsequent PR and the only images remaining in DockerHub\r\nwill be the officially released Production Airflow images.\r\n\r\nPart of

It re-orders the list to move DSA to the last format to be tried\r\n   (which is now not widely used)\r\n2.
