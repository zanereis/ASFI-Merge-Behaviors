Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch is a followup of SPARK-35463. In SPARK-35463, we output a message to stdout and now we redirect it to stderr.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAll `echo` statements in `build/mvn` should redirect to stderr if it is not followed by `exit`. It is because we use `build/mvn` to get stdout output by other scripts. If we don't redirect it, we can get invalid output, e.g. got \"Skipping checksum because shasum is not installed.\" as `commons-cli` version.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. Dev only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually test on internal system.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-23T00:32:44Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:25:11Z","closed_at":"2021-05-23T02:13:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52cb8b4e740dd93beca0af5f707f68b4a02c137c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32637/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32637/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32637/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ddf59dbd0d454b04cf7b6bbac90d2997382b3b2c","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-build","ref":"fix-build","sha":"ddf59dbd0d454b04cf7b6bbac90d2997382b3b2c","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackporting changes from #26331 to Spark 2.4, in a similar fashion, executor's `bindAddress` is passed as an input parameter for `RPCEnv.create`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also ensure `YarnAllocator` use the config when allocating new executor and use default hostname when its not configured.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecently we've came across [this issue](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/27900) with Spark running on Yarn in Istio enabled Kubernetes cluster. As I understand it, Spark 2.4 is a stepping stone for teams moving away from Scala 2.11 to Scala 2.12 and then moving to Spark 3.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, new config is added and relevant doc is updated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI will run this on Kubenetes and Istio.","created_at":"2021-05-22T12:02:35Z","updated_at":"2021-05-23T15:18:28Z","closed_at":"2021-05-23T10:02:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c1378b81d8d53eff84e787a8d7f393fccc70ef6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/99c360c146431b1c0f6509c72c80c22949cb56c7","head":{"label":"gedeh:executor-bind-address","ref":"executor-bind-address","sha":"99c360c146431b1c0f6509c72c80c22949cb56c7","user":{"login":"gedeh","id":6280668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODA2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6280668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh","html_url":"https://github.com/gedeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":369588765,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjk1ODg3NjU=","name":"spark","full_name":"gedeh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gedeh","id":6280668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyODA2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6280668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh","html_url":"https://github.com/gedeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gedeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gedeh/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the name in the comment in `jdbc.OracleIntegrationSuite` and `v2.OracleIntegrationSuite`.\r\nThe script is for creating oracle docker image.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe name of the script is `buildContainerImage`, not `buildDockerImage` now.\r\n- https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/commit/d918f5a4c6da9b0f294afb8650d1f6f951964262#diff-be303ab32e74192aca829e5ea259a0aec07aac23a6049120fb337ec4efa601b0\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed that I can build the image with `./buildContainerImage.sh -v 18.4.0

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe PR is proposed to introduce ArrayOps, MapOps and StructOps to handle data-type-based operations for StructType, ArrayType, and MapType separately.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nStructType, ArrayType, and MapType are not accepted by DataTypeOps now.\r\n\r\nWe should handle these complex types. Among them:\r\n\r\n- ArrayType supports concatenation: for example, ps.Series([[1,2,3]]) + ps.Series([[4,5,6]]) should work the same as pd.Series([[1,2,3]]) + pd.Series([[4,5,6]]), as concatenation.\r\n\r\n- StructOps will be helpful to make to/from pandas conversion data-type-based.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore the change:\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> from pyspark.pandas.config import set_option\r\n>>> set_option(\"compute.ops_on_diff_frames\", True)\r\n>>> ps.Series([[1, 2, 3]]) + ps.Series([[0.4, 0.5]])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Type object was not understood.\r\n>>> ps.Series([[1, 2, 3]]) + ps.Series([[4, 5]])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Type object was not understood.\r\n>>> ps.Series([[1, 2, 3]]) + ps.Series([['x']])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Type object was not understood.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the change:\r\n```py\r\n>>> import pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n>>> from pyspark.pandas.config import set_option\r\n>>> set_option(\"compute.ops_on_diff_frames\", True)\r\n>>> ps.Series([[1, 2, 3]]) + ps.Series([[0.4, 0.5]])\r\n0    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.4, 0.5]                                                  \r\ndtype: object\r\n>>> ps.Series([[1, 2, 3]]) + ps.Series([[4, 5]])\r\n0    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\ndtype: object\r\n>>> ps.Series([[1, 2, 3]]) + ps.Series([['x']])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Concatenation can only be applied to arrays of the same type\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nKeyword:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen a memory reservation triggers a self-spill, `ExecutionMemoryPool#releaseMemory()` will immediately notify waiting tasks that memory has been freed. If there are any waiting tasks with less than 1/2N of the memory pool, they may acquire the newly-freed memory before the current task has a chance to do so. This will cause the original memory reservation to fail. If the initial spill did not release all available memory, the reservation could have been satisfied by asking it to spill again.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to TaskMemoryManager to detect this case and retry.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis bug affects queries with a MemoryConsumer that can spill part of its memory, such as BytesToBytesMap. If the MemoryConsumer is using all available memory and there is a waiting task, then attempting to acquire more memory on the MemoryConsumer will trigger a partial self-spill. However, because the waiting task gets priority, the attempt to acquire memory will fail even if it could have been satisfied by another spill.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test to MemoryManagerSuite that previously failed and now

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nmost spark conf keys are case sensitive, including `spark.blockManager.port`, we can not get the correct port number with `spark.blockmanager.port`.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the wrong key to `spark.blockManager.port` in `BasicExecutorFeatureStep`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also ensures a fast fail when the port value is invalid for executor containers. When 0 is specified(it is valid as random port, but invalid as a k8s request), it should not be put in the `containerPort` field of executor pod desc. We do not expect executor pods to continuously fail to create because of invalid requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbugfix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31671\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31671 qualifies the warehouse at the beginning, which may fail Spark startup if something goes wrong, like the underlying FileSystem can't be initialized.\r\n\r\nThis PR falls back to the old behavior and leave the warehouse path unqualified if qualifying fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a regression. It's important to be always able to start Spark app (e.g. spark-shell), so that we can debug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\na new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to avoid wrapping if-else to the constant literals for `percentage` and `accuracy` in `percentile_approx`. They are expected to be literals (or foldable expressions).\r\n\r\nPivot works by two phrase aggregations, and it works with manipulating the input to `null` for non-matched values (pivot column and value).\r\n\r\nNote that pivot supports an optimized version without such logic with changing input to `null` for some types (non-nested types basically). So the issue fixed by this PR is only for complex types.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = Seq(\r\n  (\"a\", -1.0), (\"a\", 5.5), (\"a\", 2.5), (\"b\", 3.0), (\"b\", 5.2)).toDF(\"type\", \"value\")\r\n  .groupBy().pivot(\"type\", Seq(\"a\", \"b\")).agg(\r\n    percentile_approx(col(\"value\"), array(lit(0.5)), lit(10000)))\r\ndf.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve 'percentile_approx((IF((type <=> CAST('a' AS STRING)), value, CAST(NULL AS DOUBLE))), (IF((type <=> CAST('a' AS STRING)), array(0.5D), NULL)), (IF((type <=> CAST('a' AS STRING)), 10000, CAST(NULL AS INT))))' due to data type mismatch: The accuracy or percentage provided must be a constant literal;\r\n'Aggregate [percentile_approx(if ((type#7 <=> cast(a as string))) value#8 else cast(null as double), if ((type#7 <=> cast(a as string))) array(0.5) else cast(null as array<double>), if ((type#7 <=> cast(a as string))) 10000 else cast(null as int), 0, 0) AS a#16, percentile_approx(if ((type#7 <=> cast(b as string))) value#8 else cast(null as double), if ((type#7 <=> cast(b as string))) array(0.5) else cast(null as array<double>), if ((type#7 <=> cast(b as string))) 10000 else cast(null as int), 0, 0) AS b#18]\r\n+- Project [_1#2 AS type#7, _2#3 AS value#8]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|    a|    b|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n|[2.5]|[3.0]|\r\n+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make percentile_approx work with pivot as expected\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nChange the type of `DATASET_ID_TAG` from `Long` to `HashSet[Long]` to allow the logical plan to match multiple datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDuring the transformation from one Dataset to another Dataset, the DATASET_ID_TAG of logical plan won't change if the plan itself doesn't change:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b5241c97b17a1139a4ff719bfce7f68aef094d95/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L234-L237\r\n\r\nHowever, dataset id always changes even if the logical plan doesn't change:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b5241c97b17a1139a4ff719bfce7f68aef094d95/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L207-L208\r\n\r\nAnd this can lead to the mismatch between dataset's id and col's __dataset_id. E.g.,\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  test(\"SPARK-28344: fail ambiguous self join - Dataset.colRegex as column ref\") {\r\n    // The test can fail if we change it to:\r\n    // val df1 = spark.range(3).toDF()\r\n    // val df2 = df1.filter($\"id\" > 0).toDF()\r\n    val df1 = spark.range(3)\r\n    val df2 = df1.filter($\"id\" > 0)\r\n\r\n    withSQLConf(\r\n      SQLConf.FAIL_AMBIGUOUS_SELF_JOIN_ENABLED.key -> \"true\",\r\n      SQLConf.CROSS_JOINS_ENABLED.key -> \"true\") {\r\n      assertAmbiguousSelfJoin(df1.join(df2, df1.colRegex(\"id\") > df2.colRegex(\"id\")))\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSets up the `mypy` configuration to enable `disallow_untyped_defs` check for pandas APIs on Spark module.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently many functions in the main codes in pandas APIs on Spark module are still missing type annotations and disabled `mypy` check `disallow_untyped_defs`.\r\n\r\nWe should add more type annotations and enable the mypy check.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nThis PR adds more type annotations in pandas APIs on Spark module, which can impact interaction with development tools for users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe mypy check with a new configuration and existing tests should pass.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-20T23:02:21Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T18:03:47Z","closed_at":"2021-05-21T18:03:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3cf10f291fcd3c5aa615ce6712c2cf7ac8863457","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9f870fe10acb1c4e4a348742b301035923bc799b","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-35465/disallow_untyped_defs","ref":"issues/SPARK-35465/disallow_untyped_defs","sha":"9f870fe10acb1c4e4a348742b301035923bc799b","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch is a follow-up of SPARK-26848 (#23747). In SPARK-26848, we decided to open possibility to let end users set individual timestamp per partition. But in many cases, specifying timestamp represents the intention that we would want to go back to specific timestamp and reprocess records, which should be applied to all topics and partitions.\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to provide a way to set a global timestamp across topic-partitions which the source is subscribing to, so that end users can set all offsets by specific timestamp easily. To provide the way to config the timestamp easier, the new options only receive \"a\" timestamp for start/end timestamp.\r\n\r\nNew options introduced in this PR:\r\n\r\n* startingTimestamp\r\n* endingTimestamp\r\n\r\nAll two options receive timestamp as string.\r\n\r\nThere're priorities for options regarding starting/ending offset as we will have three options for start offsets and another three options for end offsets. Priorities are following:\r\n\r\n* starting offsets: startingTimestamp -> startingOffsetsByTimestamp -> startingOffsets\r\n* ending offsets: startingTimestamp -> startingOffsetsByTimestamp -> startingOffsets\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExisting option to specify timestamp as offset is quite verbose if there're a lot of partitions across topics. Suppose there're 100s of partitions in a topic, the json should contain 100s of times of the same timestamp. \r\n\r\nAlso, the number of partitions can also change, which requires either:\r\n\r\n* fixing the code if the json is statically created\r\n* introducing the dependencies on Kafka client and deal with Kafka API on crafting json programmatically\r\n\r\nBoth approaches are even not \"acceptable\" if we're dealing with ad-hoc query; anyone doesn't want to write the code more complicated than the query itself. Flink [provides the option](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/connectors/datastream/kafka/#kafka-consumers-start-position-configuration) to specify a timestamp for all topic-partitions like this PR, and even doesn't provide the option to specify the timestamp per topic-partition.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, end users are only required to provide a single timestamp value. No more complicated JSON format end users need to know about the structure.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR introduces two new options, described in above section.\r\n\r\nDoc changes are following:\r\n\r\n![스크린샷 2021-05-21 오후 12 01 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/119076244-3034e680-ba2d-11eb-8323-0e227932d2e5.png)\r\n![스크린샷 2021-05-21 오후 12 01 12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/119076255-35923100-ba2d-11eb-9d79-538a7f9ee738.png)\r\n![스크린샷 2021-05-21 오후 12 01 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/119076264-39be4e80-ba2d-11eb-8265-ac158f55c360.png)\r\n![스크린샷 2021-05-21 오후 12 06 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/119076271-3d51d580-ba2d-11eb-98ea-35fd72b1bbfc.png)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs covering new functionalities.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOverride `getJDBCType` method in `MySQLDialect` so that `FloatType` is mapped to `FLOAT` instead of `REAL`\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMySQL treats `REAL` as a synonym to `DOUBLE` by default (see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/numeric-types.html). Therefore, when creating a table with a column of `REAL` type, it will be created as `DOUBLE`. However, currently, `MySQLDialect` does not provide an implementation for `getJDBCType`, and will thus ultimately fall back to `JdbcUtils.getCommonJDBCType`, which maps `FloatType` to `REAL`. This change is needed so that we can properly map the `FloatType` to `FLOAT` for MySQL.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nPrior to this PR, when writing a dataframe with a `FloatType` column to a MySQL table, it will create a `DOUBLE` column. After the PR, it will create a `FLOAT` column.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test case in `JDBCSuite` that verifies the mapping.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when a map is parsed in a from_json function, only StringType key is supported. If you try to parse other type, it results on a cast exception.\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nSeq((s\"\"\"{\"2021-05-05T20:05:08\": \"sampleValue\"}\"\"\"))\r\n  .toDF(\"value\")\r\n  .withColumn(\"value1\", from_json(col(\"value\"),  MapType(TimestampType, StringType)))\r\n  .show\r\n```\r\nThis PR proposes to support for the key, the same types thar are supported for the value in the map.\r\n\r\nOnly BinaryType is excluded because it depends on the encoding and it needs a more complex solution\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe allow to cast different types for the key of the map, so it's interesting to suppot them\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nFix the explained case\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit testing and manual testing\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-20T01:05:38Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T18:38:18Z","closed_at":"2021-07-26T18:38:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a91e54b143be3546b3d09ef5a6e89868594e16bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32599/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32599/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32599/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b8a2bfea30d9d1750362588d5455557642d0dcad","head":{"label":"planga82:bugfix/spark35320_from_json_key_map_types","ref":"bugfix/spark35320_from_json_key_map_types","sha":"b8a2bfea30d9d1750362588d5455557642d0dcad","user":{"login":"planga82","id":12819544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82","html_url":"https://github.com/planga82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182507758,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1MDc3NTg=","name":"sparkFork","full_name":"planga82/sparkFork","private":false,"owner":{"login":"planga82","id":12819544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82","html_url":"https://github.com/planga82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/planga82/sparkFork","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids using f-string format that's a new feature in Python 3.6. Although it's legitimate to use this syntax because Apache Spark supports Python 3.6+, this breaks unofficial support of Python 3.5.\r\n\r\nThis specific f-string format looks something unnecessary, and doesn't look worth enough to remove such unofficial support because of one string format in an error message.\r\n\r\n**NOTE** that this PR doesn't mean that we're maintaining Python 3.5 since we dropped. It just looks like too much to remove that unofficial support only because of one string format and error message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep unofficial Python 3.5 support\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nOfficially nope.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan the linters.","created_at":"2021-05-20T01:03:55Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:53:53Z","closed_at":"2021-05-20T01:47:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"312ba859325d9acbc08f986c94deadda5c2f735b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7a464783b314557152feee9ea5a530d7cdbab4df","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-35408=followup","ref":"SPARK-35408=followup","sha":"7a464783b314557152feee9ea5a530d7cdbab4df","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

However, for a statement to be in \"all branches\" of a CaseWhen statement, it must also be in the elseValue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a bug where a subexpression can be created and run for branches of a conditional that don't pass. This can cause issues especially with a UDF in a branch that gets executed assuming the condition is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, fixes a potential bug where a UDF could be eagerly executed even though it might expect to have already passed some form of validation. For example:\r\n```\r\nval col = when($\"id\" < 0, myUdf($\"id\"))\r\nspark.range(1).select(when(col > 0, col)).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n`myUdf($\"id\")` is considered a subexpression and eagerly evaluated, because it is pulled out as a common expression from both executions of the when clause, but if `id >= 0` it should never actually be run.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR improves the interaction between partition coalescing and skew handling by moving the skew join rule ahead of the partition coalescing rule and making corresponding changes to the two rules:\r\n1. Simplify `OptimizeSkewedJoin` as it doesn't need to handle `CustomShuffleReaderExec` anymore.\r\n2. Update `CoalesceShufflePartitions` to support coalescing non-skewed partitions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's a bit hard to reason about skew join if partitions have been coalesced. A skewed partition needs to be much larger than other partitions and we need to look at the raw sizes before coalescing.\r\n\r\nIt also makes `OptimizeSkewedJoin` more robust, as we don't need to worry about a skewed partition being coalesced with a small partition and breaks skew join handling.\r\n\r\nIt also helps with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31653 , which needs to move `OptimizeSkewedJoin` to an earlier phase and run before `CoalesceShufflePartitions`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew UT and existing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake the conversion from/to pandas (for non-ExtensionDtype) data-type-based.\r\nNOTE: Ops class per ExtensionDtype and its data-type-based from/to pandas will be implemented in a separate PR as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35614.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe conversion from/to pandas includes logic for checking data types and behaving accordingly.\r\nThat makes code hard to change or maintain.\r\nSince we have introduced the Ops class per non-ExtensionDtype data type, we ought to make the conversion from/to pandas data-type-based for non-ExtensionDtypes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nKeyword:

supports marking secrets and config maps as immutable to gain performance. \r\n\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/#configmap-immutable\r\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-immutable\r\n\r\nFor K8s clusters that run many thousands of Spark applications, this can yield significant reduction in load on the kube-apiserver.\r\n\r\nFrom the K8s docs:\r\n\r\n> For clusters that extensively use Secrets (at least tens of thousands of unique Secret to Pod mounts), preventing changes to their data has the following advantages:\r\n> - protects you from accidental (or unwanted) updates that could cause applications outages\r\n> - improves performance of your cluster by significantly reducing load on kube-apiserver, by closing watches for secrets marked as immutable.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor any secrets and config maps we create in Spark that are immutable, we could mark them as immutable by including the following when building the secret/config map\r\n```\r\n.withImmutable(true)\r\n```\r\nThis feature has been supported in K8s as beta since K8s 1.19 and as GA since K8s 1.21\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch sorts equivalent expressions based on their child-parent relation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`EquivalentExpressions` maintains a map of equivalent expressions. It is `HashMap` now so the insertion order is not guaranteed to be preserved later. Subexpression elimination relies on retrieving subexpressions from the map. If there is child-parent relationships among the subexpressions, we want the child expressions come first than parent expressions, so we can replace child expressions in parent expressions with subexpression evaluation.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have two different expressions `Add(Literal(1), Literal(2))` and `Add(Literal(3), add)`.\r\n\r\nCase 1: child subexpr comes first.\r\n```scala\r\naddExprTree(add)\r\naddExprTree(Add(Literal(3), add))\r\naddExprTree(Add(Literal(3), add))\r\n```\r\n\r\nCase 2: parent subexpr comes first. For this case, we need to sort equivalent expressions.\r\n```\r\naddExprTree(Add(Literal(3), add))  => We add `Add(Literal(3), add)` into the map first, then add `add` into the map\r\naddExprTree(add)\r\naddExprTree(Add(Literal(3), add))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we are going to sort equivalent expressions at all, we don't need `LinkedHashMap` but just do sorting.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-19T03:46:08Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:25:10Z","closed_at":"2021-05-21T17:49:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4225b9cb65112570629979372f7f15016b116e5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3819bf3e544a316234f94292a2acdb8aae1d9ab1","head":{"label":"viirya:use-listhashmap","ref":"use-listhashmap","sha":"3819bf3e544a316234f94292a2acdb8aae1d9ab1","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove partition filtering speed and reduce metastore pressure.\r\nWe can first pull all the partition names, filter by expressions, and then obtain detailed information about the corresponding partitions from the MetaStore Server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen `convertFilters` cannot take effect, cannot filter the queried partitions in advance on the hive MetaStore Server. At this time, `getAllPartitionsOf` will get all partition details.\r\n\r\nWhen the Hive client cannot use the server filter, it will first obtain the values of all partitions, and then filter.\r\n\r\nWhen we have a table with a lot of partitions and there is no way to filter it on the MetaStore Server, we will get all the partition details and filter it on the client side. This is slow and puts a lot of pressure on the MetaStore Server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports SPARK-35425 (#32573).\r\n\r\nThe following two things are done in this PR.\r\n\r\n* Add note about Jinja2 as a required dependency for document build.\r\n* Add Jinja2 dependency for the document build to `spark-rm/Dockerfile`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-35375(#32509) confined the version of Jinja to <3.0.0.\r\nSo it's good to note about it in `docs/README.md` and add the dependency to `spark-rm/Dockerfile`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confimed that `make html` succeed under `python/docs` with dependencies installed by both of the following commands.\r\n```\r\npip install sphinx==2.3.1 mkdocs==1.0.4 numpy==1.18.1 jinja2==2.11.3\r\npip install 'sphinx<3.5.0' mkdocs numpy

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nTo pass the TPCDS-related plan stability tests in scala-2.13, this PR proposes to fix two things below;\r\n - (1) Sorts elements in the predicate `InSet` and the source filter `In` for printing their nodes.\r\n - (2) Formats nested collection elements (`Seq`, `Array`, and `Set`) recursively in `TreeNode.argString`.\r\n\r\nAs for (1), it seems v2.12/v2.13 prints `Set` elements with a different order, so we need to sort them explicitly. As for (2), the `Seq` implementation is different between v2.12/v2.13, so we need to format nested  `Seq` elements correctly to hide the name of its implementation (See an example below);\r\n```\r\n (74) Expand [codegen id : 20]\r\n Input [5]: [sales#41, RETURNS#42, profit#43, channel#44, id#45]\r\n-Arguments: [ArrayBuffer(sales#41, returns#42, ...    <-- scala-2.12\r\n+Arguments: [Vector(sales#41, returns#42, ...         <-- scala-2.13\r\n\r\n+Arguments: [[(sales#41, returns#42, ...              <--  the proposed fix to hide the name of its implementation\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo pass the tests in Scala v2.13.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this fix changes query explain strings.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemove commons-httpclient as a direct dependency.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark is pulling in commons-httpclient as a dependency directly. commons-httpclient went EOL years ago and there are most likely CVEs not being reported against it, thus we should remove it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Existing unittests\r\n- Checked the dependency tree before and after introducing the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix test failure under Scala 2.13 by making test `ScalaFunction` `StrLenMagic` public.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA few tests are failing when using Scala 2.13 with error message like the following:\r\n```\r\n[info]   Cause: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 35, Column 121: failed to compile: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 35, Column 121: No a\r\npplicable constructor/method found for actual parameters \"org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String\"; candidates are: \"public int org.apache.spark.sql.connector.DataSourceV2FunctionSuite$StrLenMagic$.invoke(org.apache.spark.\r\nunsafe.types.UTF8String)\"\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.compilerError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:387)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.CodeGenerator$.org$apache$spark$sql$catalyst$expressions$codegen$CodeGenerator$$doCompile(CodeGenerator.scala:1415)\r\n[info]   at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.CodeGenerator$$anon$1.load(CodeGenerator.scala:1501)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to be caused by the fact that the `StrLenMagic` is using `private` scope. After removing the `private` keyword the tests are now passing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *.DataSourceV2FunctionSuite\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd tests to check the `EXCEPTION` rebase mode explicitly in the datasources:\r\n- Parquet: `DATE` type and `TIMESTAMP`: `INT96`, `TIMESTAMP_MICROS`, `TIMESTAMP_MILLIS`\r\n- Avro: `DATE` type and `TIMESTAMP`: `timestamp-millis` and `timestamp-micros`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To improve test coverage\r\n2. The `EXCEPTION` rebase mode should be checked independently from the default settings.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe following two things are done in this PR.\r\n\r\n* Add note about Jinja2 as a required dependency for document build.\r\n* Add Jinja2 dependency for the document build to `spark-rm/Dockerfile`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-35375(#32509) confined the version of Jinja to <3.0.0.\r\nSo it's good to note about it in `docs/README.md` and add the dependency to `spark-rm/Dockerfile`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confimed that `make html` succeed under `python/docs` with the following command.\r\n```\r\nsudo pip install 'sphinx<3.1.0' mkdocs numpy pydata_sphinx_theme ipython nbsphinx numpydoc 'jinja2<3.0.0'\r\n```","created_at":"2021-05-17T12:39:57Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T07:49:47Z","closed_at":"2021-05-18T07:48:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"514c302b2f4bd7052f4869edc52ab3e440ff2795","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db1257dce192e0d4d2e39e83ddfe57d0c727017c","head":{"label":"sarutak:required-module-for-python-doc","ref":"required-module-for-python-doc","sha":"db1257dce192e0d4d2e39e83ddfe57d0c727017c","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

would say more than 99%. For 1% case, we can guide developers to enable this configuration for further debugging.\r\n\r\nIn Databricks, it has been enabled for around 6 months, and I have had zero negative feedback on it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo show simplified exception messages to end users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will hide the internal Python worker traceback.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test cases should cover.","created_at":"2021-05-17T06:03:09Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:53:54Z","closed_at":"2021-05-18T03:27:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6b2cc24f4afa4bbcf0e7c5667dc2cf4eca27170","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32569/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32569/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32569/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8c7af840b9f3da34f00a415159de7b9e79f6ec2f","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-35419","ref":"SPARK-35419","sha":"8c7af840b9f3da34f00a415159de7b9e79f6ec2f","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a new configuration, `spark.kubernetes.driver.reusePersistentVolumeClaim`, to reuse driver-owned `PersistentVolumeClaims` of the **deleted** executor pods. \r\n\r\nNote also that `driver-owned PersistentVolumeClaims` is controlled by `spark.kubernetes.driver.ownPersistentVolumeClaim` which is recently added.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPVC creations take some times. This feature can reduce it by reusing it.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can start `Pi` app with two executors with PVCs.\r\n```\r\n$ k logs -f pi | grep ExecutorPodsAllocator\r\n21/05/16 23:36:32 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Going to request 2 executors from Kubernetes for ResourceProfile Id: 0, target: 2 running: 0.\r\n21/05/16 23:36:32 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Found 0 reusable PVCs from 0 PVCs\r\n21/05/16 23:36:32 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Trying to create PersistentVolumeClaim pi-exec-1-pvc-0 with StorageClass scaleio\r\n21/05/16 23:36:33 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Trying to create PersistentVolumeClaim pi-exec-2-pvc-0 with StorageClass scaleio\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter killing one executor, Spark is trying to look up the reusable PVCs, but the dead-executor's PVC may not returned yet because K8s works asynchronously. In this case, Spark is trying to create a new PVC as a normal operation.\r\n```\r\n21/05/16 23:38:51 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Going to request 1 executors from Kubernetes for ResourceProfile Id: 0, target: 2 running: 1.\r\n21/05/16 23:38:51 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Found 0 reusable PVCs from 2 PVCs\r\n21/05/16 23:38:51 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Trying to create PersistentVolumeClaim pi-exec-3-pvc-0 with StorageClass scaleio\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter killing another executor, Spark found one reusable PVC, `pi-exec-1-pvc-0`, and reuse it.\r\n```\r\n21/05/16 23:39:18 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Going to request 1 executors from Kubernetes for ResourceProfile Id: 0, target: 2 running: 1.\r\n21/05/16 23:39:18 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Found 1 reusable PVCs from 3 PVCs\r\n21/05/16 23:39:18 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Reuse PersistentVolumeClaim pi-exec-1-pvc-0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, we can easily notice the remounted PVC because `ClaimName`, `pi-exec-1-pvc-0`, doesn't have the prefix of pod name, `pi-exec-4`.\r\n```\r\n$ k describe pod pi-exec-4 | grep pi-exec-1-pvc-0\r\n    ClaimName:  pi-exec-1-pvc-0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but this is a new feature which is disabled by the new conf.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly added test case.\r\n\r\nK8S IT test also passed.\r\n```\r\nKubernetesSuite:\r\n- Run SparkPi with no resources\r\n- Run SparkPi with a very long application name.\r\n- Use SparkLauncher.NO_RESOURCE\r\n- Run SparkPi with a master URL without a scheme.\r\n- Run SparkPi with an argument.\r\n- Run SparkPi with custom labels, annotations, and environment variables.\r\n- All pods have the same service account by default\r\n- Run extraJVMOptions check on driver\r\n- Run SparkRemoteFileTest using a remote data file\r\n- Verify logging configuration is picked from the provided SPARK_CONF_DIR/log4j.properties\r\n- Run SparkPi with env and mount secrets.\r\n- Run PySpark on simple pi.py example\r\n- Run PySpark to test a pyfiles example\r\n- Run PySpark with memory

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. replace executeCollectIterator() by executeCollectIteratorFuture() in SparkPlan.scala to run collect query in async way and return the future of

\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n#31269 gives a partial fix to SPARK-33933, which is not a perfect solution. This changes can make sure the broadcast collect job is submitted before shuffle map jobs. #31269 ensure the calling of materialize() of BroadcastQueryStage is before ShuffleQueryStage.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes an issue when dealing with common expressions in conditional expressions such as `CaseWhen` during subexpression elimination.\r\n\r\nFor example, previously we find common expressions among conditions of `CaseWhen`, but children expressions are also counted into. We should not count these children expressions as common expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf the redundant children expressions are counted as common expressions too, they will be redundantly evaluated and miss the subexpression elimination opportunity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTill now there is no support in infer schema for the DateType format while reading the CSV/json. In this PR, code change is done to support the DateType when inferschema set true in the options\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMany times there are multiple columns which are DateType but after inferred from schema they are added as StringType in the schema and than there is need to convert into to_date before we start the running any query. After this change DateType will be added in the schema instead of the StringType\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test added , also testing is done while running read command on spark

New line characters are escaped by default in spark3.2, hence plan is not showing in the tree structure. In this PR, we are preventing skipping meta characters in case of Explain command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`scala>sql(\"EXPLAIN COST SELECT item.i_brand, count(1),

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen creating `Invoke` and `StaticInvoke` for `ScalarFunction`'s magic method, set `propagateNull` to false.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen `propgagateNull` is true (which is the default value), `Invoke` and `StaticInvoke` will return null if any of the argument is null. For scalar function this is incorrect, as we should leave the logic to function implementation instead.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Now null arguments shall be properly handled with magic method.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new tests.","created_at":"2021-05-14T17:49:09Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T15:01:17Z","closed_at":"2021-05-18T08:46:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0e71ca50debc9d393f02611609deadcf5707493","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fb0d959fa2ba7ced2370840e3bb9fd53321b921b","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-35389","ref":"SPARK-35389","sha":"fb0d959fa2ba7ced2370840e3bb9fd53321b921b","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

As for aggregates, this rule is applied in the physical planning phase because all the grouping exprs are not extracted during the logical phase (This is the same restriction with `NormalizeFloatingNumbers`).\r\n\r\nThe major differences from `NormalizeFloatingNumbers` are as follows;\r\n - The rule covers all the binary comparisons (`EqualTo`, `GreaterThan`, ...) and `In`/`InSet` in a plan (`NormalizeFloatingNumbers` is applied only into the `EqualTo` comparison in a join plan, an equi-join).\r\n - This rule does not apply `normalize` recursively and just adds a `SortMapKeys` expr just on each top-level expr (e.g., top-level grouping expr and left/right side expr of binary comparisons).\r\n - This rule additionally handles `SortOrder`s in sort-related plans.\r\n\r\nFor sorting map entries, I reused the array ordering logic (See: `MapType.compare` and `CodegenContext.genComp`) because keys and values in map entries follow the array format; it checks if key arrays in two maps are the same first, an then check if value arrays are the same. \r\n\r\nNOTE: Adding duplicate `SortMapKeys` exprs in a binary comparison tree is a known issue; for example, in a query below, `MapType`'s column, `a`, is sorted twice;\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq((Map(1->1), Map(1->2), Map(1->1))).toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\").write.saveAsTable(\"t\")\r\nscala> sql(\"select * from t where a = b and a = c\").explain()\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Filter ((sortmapkeys(a#35) = sortmapkeys(b#36)) AND (sortmapkeys(a#35) = sortmapkeys(c#37)))\r\n+- FileScan parquet default.t[a#35,b#36,c#37] Batched: false, DataFilters: [(sortmapkeys(a#35) = sortmapkeys(b#36)), (sortmapkeys(a#35) = sortmapkeys(c#37))], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/maropu/Repositories/spark/spark-master/spark-warehouse/t], PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<a:map<int,int>,b:map<int,int>,c:map<int,int>>\r\n```\r\nBut, I don't have a smart idea to avoid it in this PR for now. Probably, I think common subexpression elimination in filter plans can solve it, but Spark does not have the optimization now. (Fro more details, see the previous @viirya PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30565).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe main code change is:\r\n* Change rule `DemoteBroadcastHashJoin` to `DynamicJoinSelection` and add shuffle hash join selection code.\r\n* Specify a join strategy hint `PREFER_SHUFFLE_HASH` or `SHUFFLE_HASH` if AQE think a join can be converted to SHJ.\r\n* Skip `preferSortMerge` config check in AQE side if a join can be converted to SHJ.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUse AQE runtime statistics to decide if we can use shuffled hash join instead of sort merge join. Currently, the formula of shuffled hash join selection dose not work due to the dymanic shuffle partition number.\r\n\r\nAdd a new config `spark.sql.adaptive.maxShuffledHashJoinLocalMapThreshold` to decide if join can be converted to shuffled hash join safely.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, add a new config.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd test.","created_at":"2021-05-14T08:11:31Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T13:05:50Z","closed_at":"2021-05-26T14:16:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae83d24ded16d7d280451952b71f18e3e6c2ef35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32550/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32550/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32550/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/957215452e9df57f5e0424f63556897ea928744f","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-35282-2","ref":"SPARK-35282-2","sha":"957215452e9df57f5e0424f63556897ea928744f","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes move ORC data source options from Python, Scala and Java into a single page.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSo far, the documentation for ORC data source options is separated into different pages for each language API documents. However, this makes managing many options inconvenient, so it is efficient to manage all options in a single page and provide a link to that page in the API of each language.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the documents will be shown below after this change:\r\n\r\n- \"ORC Files\" page\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-05-21 at 2 07 14
