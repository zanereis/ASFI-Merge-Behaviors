Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

Invoke `refreshTable()` from `AlterTableRenamePartitionCommand.run()` after partitions renaming. In particular, this re-creates the cache associated with the modified table.\r\n2. Refresh the cache associated with tables from v2 table catalogs in the `ALTER TABLE .. RENAME TO PARTITION` command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issues portrayed by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (col0 int, part0 int) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (part0);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION (part0=0) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION (part0=1) SELECT 1;\r\nspark-sql> CACHE TABLE tbl1;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n0\t0\r\n1\t1\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl1 PARTITION (part0=0) RENAME TO PARTITION (part=2);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n0\t0\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\nThe last query must not return `0\t2` since `0  0` was renamed by previous command.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChanged the cost function in CBO to match documentation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe parameter `spark.sql.cbo.joinReorder.card.weight` is documented as:\r\n```\r\nThe weight of cardinality (number of rows) for plan cost comparison in join reorder: rows * weight + size * (1 - weight).\r\n```\r\nThe implementation in `JoinReorderDP.betterThan` does not match this documentaiton:\r\n```    \r\ndef betterThan(other: JoinPlan, conf: SQLConf): Boolean = {\r\n      if (other.planCost.card == 0 || other.planCost.size == 0) {\r\n        false\r\n      } else {\r\n        val relativeRows = BigDecimal(this.planCost.card) / BigDecimal(other.planCost.card)\r\n        val relativeSize = BigDecimal(this.planCost.size) / BigDecimal(other.planCost.size)\r\n        relativeRows * conf.joinReorderCardWeight +\r\n          relativeSize * (1 - conf.joinReorderCardWeight) < 1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis different implementation has an unfortunate consequence:\r\ngiven two plans A and B, both A betterThan B and B betterThan A might give the same results. This happes when one has many rows with small sizes and other has few rows with large sizes.\r\n\r\nA example values, that have this fenomen with the default weight value (0.7):\r\nA.card = 500, B.card = 300\r\nA.size = 30, B.size = 80\r\nBoth A betterThan B and B betterThan A would have score above 1 and would return false.\r\n\r\nThis happens with several of the TPCDS queries.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation does not have this behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew and existing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChanged the cost function in CBO to match documentation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe parameter `spark.sql.cbo.joinReorder.card.weight` is documented as:\r\n```\r\nThe weight of cardinality (number of rows) for plan cost comparison in join reorder: rows * weight + size * (1 - weight).\r\n```\r\nThe implementation in `JoinReorderDP.betterThan` does not match this documentaiton:\r\n```    \r\ndef betterThan(other: JoinPlan, conf: SQLConf): Boolean = {\r\n      if (other.planCost.card == 0 || other.planCost.size == 0) {\r\n        false\r\n      } else {\r\n        val relativeRows = BigDecimal(this.planCost.card) / BigDecimal(other.planCost.card)\r\n        val relativeSize = BigDecimal(this.planCost.size) / BigDecimal(other.planCost.size)\r\n        relativeRows * conf.joinReorderCardWeight +\r\n          relativeSize * (1 - conf.joinReorderCardWeight) < 1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis different implementation has an unfortunate consequence:\r\ngiven two plans A and B, both A betterThan B and B betterThan A might give the same results. This happes when one has many rows with small sizes and other has few rows with large sizes.\r\n\r\nA example values, that have this fenomen with the default weight value (0.7):\r\nA.card = 500, B.card = 300\r\nA.size = 30, B.size = 80\r\nBoth A betterThan B and B betterThan A would have score above 1 and would return false.\r\n\r\nThis happens with several of the TPCDS queries.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation does not have this behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew and existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use python3 instead of python in SQL documentation build.\r\nAfter SPARK-29672, we use `sql/create-docs.sh` everywhere in Spark dev. We should fix it in `sql/create-docs.sh` too.\r\nThis blocks release because the release container does not have `python` but only `python3`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo unblock the release.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually ran the script

in script transform, we parse column name  to avoid this problem

think in `InsertIntoHiveDirComman`, we should do same thing too. And I have verified this method can make spark-2.4 work well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMore save use serde\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

in script transform, we parse column name  to avoid this problem

think in `InsertIntoHiveDirComman`, we should do same thing too. And I have verified this method can make spark-2.4 work well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMore save use serde\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

Accumulate the `totalSpillBytes` when merging two `UnsafeExternalSorter`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28780:\r\n\r\n> It happends when hash aggregate downgrades to sort based aggregate.\r\n`UnsafeExternalSorter.createWithExistingInMemorySorter` calls spill on an `InMemorySorter` immediately, but the memory pointed by `InMemorySorter` is acquired by outside `BytesToBytesMap`, instead the allocatedPages in `UnsafeExternalSorter`. So the memory spill bytes metric is always 0, but disk bytes spill metric is right.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR also fixes the `UnsafeExternalSorter.merge` by accumulating the `totalSpillBytes` of two sorters. Thus, we can report the correct spilled size in `HashAggregateExec.finishAggregate`.\r\n\r\nIssues can be reproduced by the following step by checking the SQL metrics in UI:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-shell --driver-memory 512m --executor-memory 512m --executor-cores 1 --conf \"spark.default.parallelism=1\"\r\nscala> sql(\"select id, count(1) from range(10000000) group by id\").write.csv(\"/tmp/result.json\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"200\" alt=\"WeChatfe5146180d91015e03b9a27852e9a443\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16397174/103625414-e6fc6280-4f75-11eb-8b93-c55095bdb5b8.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"200\" alt=\"WeChat42ab0e73c5fbc3b14c12ab85d232071d\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16397174/103625420-e8c62600-4f75-11eb-8e1f-6f5e8ab561b9.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users can see the correct spill metrics after this PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested manually and added

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to strip auto-generated cast. The main logic is:\r\n1. Add tag if Cast is specified by user.\r\n2. Wrap `PrettyAttribute` in usePrettyExpression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake sql consistent with dsl. Here is an inconsistent example before this PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- output field name: FLOOR(1)\r\nspark.emptyDataFrame.select(floor(lit(1)))\r\n\r\n-- output field name: FLOOR(CAST(1 AS DOUBLE))\r\nspark.sql(\"select floor(1)\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that, we don't remove the `Cast` so the auto-generated `Cast` can still work. The only changed place is `usePrettyExpression`, we use `PrettyAttribute` replace `Cast` to give a better sql string.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the default field name may change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNow the spark-sql does not support parse the sql statements with bracketed comments.\r\nFor the sql statements:\r\n```\r\n/* SELECT 'test';

one is illegal.\r\nIn this PR, we ignore the content in bracketed comments while splitting the sql statements.\r\nBesides, we ignore the comment without any content.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This backport comes

Looks like there is a regression in scala-maven-plugin somewhere between 4.4.0 and 4.3.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo unblock the release.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt can be tested as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./dev/create-release/do-release-docker.sh -d $WORKING_DIR\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-05T07:50:06Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T07:31:51Z","closed_at":"2021-01-05T08:20:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"49beb01280f48f336f243b8dcc18c125ed7180fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31031/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31031/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31031/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4812cd50b9e243e249ca1f39ae296068fcd99273","head":{"label":"apache:SPARK-34007","ref":"SPARK-34007","sha":"4812cd50b9e243e249ca1f39ae296068fcd99273","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR makes `AppStatusListener` update the peak memory metrics for each Executor on task end like other peak memory metrics (e.g, stage, executors in a stage).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen `AppStatusListener#onExecutorMetricsUpdate` is called, peak memory metrics for Executors, stages and executors in a stage are updated but currently, the metrics only for Executors are not updated on task end.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Executor peak memory metrics is updated more accurately.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAfter I run a job with `local-cluster[1,1,1024]` and visited `/api/v1/<appid>/executors`, I confirmed `peakExecutorMemory` metrics is shown for an Executor even though the life time of each job is very short .\r\nI also modify the json files for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29703.\r\nIt renames `HADOOP_VERSION` environment variable to `PYSPARK_HADOOP_VERSION` in case `HADOOP_VERSION` is already being used somewhere. Arguably `HADOOP_VERSION` is a pretty common name.

However, after we add the PaddingAndLengthCheckForCharVarchar rule which will rewrite the query output, thus, the `resolved agg` cannot match original attributes anymore. \r\n\r\nIt causes some dissociative sort attribute to be pushed in and fails the query\r\n\r\n\r\n``` logtalk\r\n[info]   Failed to analyze query: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: expression 'testcat.t1.`v`' is neither present in the group by, nor is it an aggregate function.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr add support reorder predicates based on selectivity and compute cost.\r\n\r\n1. Conjunctive predicates\r\n   Formula: `(selectivity - 1.0) / expression cost`\r\n2. Disjunctive predicates\r\n   Formula: `(-selectivity) / expression cost`\r\n\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove filter performance. Many mainstream databases support this

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed the following command successfully finish with JDK8 and JDK11.\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver -Pyarn

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen sparkR is run at log level INFO, a summary of how the worker spent its time processing the partition is printed. There is a logic error where it is over-reporting the time inputting rows.\r\n\r\nIn detail: the variable inputElap in a wider context is used to mark the end of reading rows, but in the part changed here it was used as a local variable for measuring the beginning of compute time in a loop over the groups in the partition. Thus, the error is not observable if there is only one group per partition, which is what you get in unit tests.\r\n\r\nFor our application, here's what a log entry looks like before these changes were applied:\r\n\r\n`20/10/09 04:08:58 INFO RRunner: Times: boot = 0.013 s, init = 0.005 s, broadcast = 0.000 s, read-input = 529.471 s, compute = 492.037 s, write-output = 0.020 s, total = 1021.546 s`\r\n\r\nthis indicates that we're spending more time reading rows than operating on the rows.\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n`20/12/15 06:43:29 INFO RRunner: Times: boot = 0.013 s, init = 0.010 s, broadcast = 0.000 s, read-input = 120.275 s, compute = 1680.161 s, write-output = 0.045 s, total = 1812.553 s\r\n`\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMetrics shouldn't mislead?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAside from no longer misleading, no\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit tests passed.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThere are many v2 commands such as `SHOW TABLES`, `DESCRIBE TABLE`, etc. that require creating `InternalRow`s. Currently, the code to create `InternalRow`s are duplicated across many commands and it can be moved into `V2CommandExec` to remove duplicate code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor `AllJobsPage `class, `AllJobsPage` gets the schedulingMode of enumerated type by loading the `spark.scheduler.mode `configuration from Sparkconf, but an enumeration conversion error occurs when I set the value of this configuration to lowercase.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this problem is that the value of the `SchedulingMode `enumeration class is uppercase, which occurs when I configure `spark.scheduler.mode` to be lowercase.\r\n\r\nI saw that the `#org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSchedulerImpl` class convert the `spark. scheduler.mode` value to uppercase, so I think it should be converted in `AllJobsPage `as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAn enumerated conversion error occurred with Spark when I set

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to upgrade cloudpickle from 1.5.0 to 1.6.0.\r\nIt virtually contains one fix:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/commit/4510be850d55bc60decf86953324f98bc3199f9e\r\n\r\nFrom a cursory look, this isn't a regression, and not even properly supported in Python:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pickle\r\n>>> pickle.dumps({}.keys())\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nTypeError: cannot pickle 'dict_keys'

In particular, this re-creates the cache associated with the modified table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issues portrayed by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (col0 int, part0 int) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (part0);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION (part0=0) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION (part0=1) SELECT 1;\r\nspark-sql> CACHE TABLE tbl1;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n0\t0\r\n1\t1\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl1 DROP PARTITION (part0=0);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n0\t0\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\nThe last query must not return `0\t0` since it was deleted by previous command.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes for the example above:\r\n```sql\r\n...\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl1 DROP PARTITION (part0=0);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove flaky NaiveBayes test\r\n\r\nCurrent test may sometimes fail under different BLAS library.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR add an `add_hours` function.  Here's how users currently need to add hours to a time column:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.withColumn(\"plus_2_hours\", expr(\"first_datetime + INTERVAL 2 hours\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe don't want to make users manipulate strings in their Scala code.  We also don't want to force users to pass around column names when they should be passing around Column objects.\r\n\r\nThe `add_hours` function will make this logic a lot more intuitive and consistent with the rest of the API:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.withColumn(\"plus_2_hours\", add_hours(col(\"first_datetime\"), lit(2)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [Stackoverflow question on this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40883084/adding-12-hours-to-datetime-column-in-spark) has 21,000 views, so this feature will be useful for a lot of users.\r\n\r\n[Spark 3 made some awesome improvements to the dates / times APIs](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/07/22/a-comprehensive-look-at-dates-and-timestamps-in-apache-spark-3-0.html) and this PR is one example of an improvement that'll continue making these APIs easier to use.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are the `INTERVAL` and UDF work-arounds, so this isn't strictly needed, but it makes the API a lot easier to work with when performing hour-based computations.  It'll also make the answer easier to find.  It's not easy to find the `INTERVAL` solution in [the docs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions$.html).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this adds the `add_hours` function to the `org.apache.spark.sql.functions` object which is a public facing API.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.getFinalPhysicalPlan, when newStages are generated, sort the new stages by class type to make sure BroadcastQueryState precede others.\r\nIt can make sure the broadcast job are submitted before map jobs to avoid waiting for job schedule and cause broadcast timeout. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen enable AQE, in getFinalPhysicalPlan, spark traversal the physical plan bottom up and create query stage for materialized part by createQueryStages and materialize those new created query stages to submit map stages or broadcasting. When ShuffleQueryStage are materializing before BroadcastQueryStage, the map job and broadcast job are submitted almost at the same time, but map job will hold all the computing resources. If the map job runs slow (when lots of data needs to process and the resource is limited), the broadcast job cannot be started(and finished) before spark.sql.broadcastTimeout, thus cause whole job failed (introduced in SPARK-31475).\r\nThe workaround to increase spark.sql.broadcastTimeout doesn't make sense and graceful, because the data to broadcast is very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Add UT\r\n2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove special handling of `CacheTable` in `TestHiveQueryExecution. analyzed` because it does not allow to support of `spark_catalog` in Hive table names. `spark_catalog` could be handled by a few lines below:\r\n```scala\r\n      case UnresolvedRelation(ident, _, _) =>\r\n        if (ident.length > 1 && ident.head.equalsIgnoreCase(CatalogManager.SESSION_CATALOG_NAME)) {\r\n```\r\nadded by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30883.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To have feature parity with v1 In-Memory catalog.\r\n2. To be able to write unified tests for In-Memory and Hive external catalogs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the test suite with new UT:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdded the `RemoveNoopOperators` rule to optimization batch `Union`.  Also made sure that the `RemoveNoopOperators` would be idempotent. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn several TPCDS queries the `CombineUnions` rule does not manage to combine unions, because they have noop `Project`s between them.\r\nThe `Project`s will be removed by `RemoveNoopOperators`, but by then `ReplaceDistinctWithAggregate` has been applied and there are aggregates between the unions. Adding a copy of `RemoveNoopOperators` earlier in the optimization chain allows `CombineUnions` to work on more queries.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew UTs and the output of

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes an incorrect condition when comparing offset range size and min partition config.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen calculating offset ranges, we consider `minPartitions` configuration. If `minPartitions` is not set or is less than or equal the size of given ranges, it means there are enough partitions at Kafka so we don't need to split offsets to satisfy min partition requirement. But the current condition is `offsetRanges.size > minPartitions.get` and is not correct. Currently `getRanges` will split offsets in unnecessary case.\r\n\r\nBesides, in non-split case, we can assign preferred executor location and reuse `KafkaConsumer`. So unnecessary splitting offset range will miss the chance to reuse `KafkaConsumer`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\nManual test in Spark cluster with Kafka.","created_at":"2021-01-02T17:59:18Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:28:26Z","closed_at":"2021-01-03T09:29:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32b6f3712ded007927de90faae1e7977378fa71e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add latest offset to source progress for streaming queries.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently we record start and end offsets per source in streaming process. Latest offset is an important information for streaming process but the progress lacks of this info. We can use it to track the process lag and adjust streaming queries. We should add latest offset to source progress.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, for new metric about latest source offset in source progress.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n- Adds as small  hierarchy of warnings to be used in PySpark applications. These extend built-in classes and top level `PySparkWarning`.\r\n- Replaces `DeprecationWarnings` (intended for developers) with PySpark specific subclasses of `FutureWarning` (intended for end users).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- To be more precise and add users additional control (in addition to standard module level filters) over PySpark warnings handling.\r\n- Correct semantics (at the moment we use `DeprecationWarning` in user-facing API, but it is intended \"for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are intended for other Python developers\").\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Code can raise different type of warning than before.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-31T15:32:51Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T15:09:17Z","closed_at":"2021-01-18T00:33:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"362f0d64e9fffec93aa957fde0ceffe58c5dd9b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30985/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30985/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30985/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/33db203f2a6364837ebe9851f0665e66fab0644d","head":{"label":"zero323:SPARK-33730","ref":"SPARK-33730","sha":"33db203f2a6364837ebe9851f0665e66fab0644d","user":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43824676,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzgyNDY3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"zero323/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zero323/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds support for json / jsonb expression as PushableColumnBase.\r\n\r\nWith this change, SupportsPushDownFilters implementation would be able to push Filter down to DB.\r\n\r\nThe activation of this enhancement is controlled by nestedPredicatePushdownEnabled flag.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently implementation of SupportsPushDownFilters doesn't have a chance to perform pushdown even if third party DB engine supports json expression pushdown.\r\n\r\nThis poses challenge when table schema uses json / jsonb to encode large amount of data.\r\n\r\nHere is some background on how I came about the current approach.\r\n\r\nCanonical json expression is something like: phone->code or phone->>code where phone is the json(b) column and code is the field.\r\nHowever, the json expression is rejected by:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedException: Invalid call to toAttribute on unresolved object, tree: unresolvedalias(lambdafunction(code, lambda 'phone, false), None)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedAlias.toAttribute(unresolved.scala:463)\r\n    at

Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWith this change, plus corresponding changes in spark-cassandra-connector, Filter involving json expression can be pushed down.\r\n\r\nHere is the plan prior to predicate pushdown:\r\n```\r\n2020-12-26 03:28:59,926 (Time-limited test) [DEBUG -

In particular, this invalidates the cache associated with the modified table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issues portrayed by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (col0 int, part0 int) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (part0);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION (part0=0) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO tbl1 PARTITION (part0=1) SELECT 1;\r\nspark-sql> CACHE TABLE tbl1;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n0\t0\r\n1\t1\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl1 DROP PARTITION (part0=0);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n0\t0\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\nThe last query must not return `0\t0` since it was deleted by previous command.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes for the example above:\r\n```sql\r\n...\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE tbl1 DROP PARTITION (part0=0);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM tbl1;\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInvoke `refreshTable()` from `AlterTableDropPartitionCommand.run()` after partitions dropping. In particular, this invalidates the cache associated with the modified table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile querying the table, to not return data from the dropped partitions. See the example in SPARK-33941.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, Spark doesn't return the dropped partition data:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl2 (id int, part int) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (part)\")\r\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\nscala> sql(\"INSERT INTO tbl2 PARTITION (part=0) SELECT 0\")\r\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\nscala> sql(\"INSERT INTO tbl2 PARTITION (part=1) SELECT 1\")\r\n\r\nscala> val df1 = spark.table(\"tbl2\")\r\ndf1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [id: int, part: int]\r\nscala> val df2 = spark.table(\"tbl2\")\r\ndf2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChange `Column.named` code to let expression check  if exists `UnresolvedExtractValue` and use `UnresolvedAlias` to assign name.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's more reasonable to treat user specify expression as unresolved expression then we should assign name after analyze.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have this code\r\n```\r\nspark.range(1).selectExpr(\"id as id1\", \"id as id2\")\r\n  .selectExpr(\"cast(struct(id1, id2).id1 as int)\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nbefore this PR, the field name is `CAST(struct(id1, id2)[id1] AS INT)`.\r\n\r\nAfter, the field name is `CAST(struct(id1, id2).id1 AS INT)`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the default field name may be changed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd test.","created_at":"2020-12-30T10:07:47Z","updated_at":"2021-06-07T09:02:40Z","closed_at":"2021-01-19T09:36:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1b502383ebf97464cdda6400889b691af6c0fc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30974/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30974/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30974/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1b00b8537cd4c2be4ad7715f4106947c3dc9a53a","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-33939-0","ref":"SPARK-33939-0","sha":"1b00b8537cd4c2be4ad7715f4106947c3dc9a53a","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposed to make worker/executor decommission signal configurable.\r\n\r\n* Added confs: `spark.worker.decommission.signal` / `spark.executor.decommission.signal`\r\n* Rename `WorkerSigPWRReceived`/ `ExecutorSigPWRReceived` to `WorkerDecomSigReceived`/ `ExecutorDecomSigReceived`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current signal `PWR` can't work on macOS since it's not compliant with POSIX while macOS does.  So the developers currently can't do end-to-end decommission test on their macOS environment.\r\n\r\nBesides, the configuration becomes more flexible for users in case the default signal (`PWR`) gets conflicted with their own applications/environment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo (it's a new API for 3.2)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nChanged the cost function in CBO to match documentation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe parameter `spark.sql.cbo.joinReorder.card.weight` is documented as:\r\n```\r\nThe weight of cardinality (number of rows) for plan cost comparison in join reorder: rows * weight + size * (1 - weight).\r\n```\r\nThe implementation in `JoinReorderDP.betterThan` does not match this documentaiton:\r\n```    \r\ndef betterThan(other: JoinPlan, conf: SQLConf): Boolean = {\r\n      if (other.planCost.card == 0 || other.planCost.size == 0) {\r\n        false\r\n      } else {\r\n        val relativeRows = BigDecimal(this.planCost.card) / BigDecimal(other.planCost.card)\r\n        val relativeSize = BigDecimal(this.planCost.size) / BigDecimal(other.planCost.size)\r\n        relativeRows * conf.joinReorderCardWeight +\r\n          relativeSize * (1 - conf.joinReorderCardWeight) < 1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis different implementation has an unfortunate consequence:\r\ngiven two plans A and B, both A betterThan B and B betterThan A might give the same results. This happes when one has many rows with small sizes and other has few rows with large sizes.\r\n\r\nA example values, that have this fenomen with the default weight value (0.7):\r\nA.card = 500, B.card = 300\r\nA.size = 30, B.size = 80\r\nBoth A betterThan B and B betterThan A would have score above 1 and would return false.\r\n\r\nThis happens with several of the TPCDS queries.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation does not have this behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew and existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Replace `SessionCatalogAndNamespace` by `DatabaseInSessionCatalog` in resolving database name from v1 session catalog.\r\n2. Throw more precise errors from `DatabaseInSessionCatalog`\r\n3. Fix expected error messages in `v1.ShowTablesSuiteBase`\r\n\r\nCloses #30947\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent error message \"multi-part identifier cannot be empty\" may confuse users. And this error message is just a consequence of \"incorrectly\" applied an implicit class. For example, `SHOW TABLES IN spark_catalog`:\r\n\r\n1. Spark cuts off `spark_catalog` from namespaces in `SessionCatalogAndNamespace`, so, `ns == Seq.empty` here: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0617dfce7beb34662ab30a607721e9b46e65c21e/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/ResolveSessionCatalog.scala#L365\r\n2. Then `ns.length != 1` is `true` and Spark tries to raise the exception at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0617dfce7beb34662ab30a607721e9b46e65c21e/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/ResolveSessionCatalog.scala#L367\r\n3.  ... but `ns.quoted` triggers implicit wrapping `Seq.empty` by `MultipartIdentifierHelper`, and hit to the second check `if (parts.isEmpty)` at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/156704ba0dfcae39a80b8f0ce778b73913db03b2/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connector/catalog/CatalogV2Implicits.scala#L120-L122\r\n\r\nSo, Spark throws the exception at third step instead of `new AnalysisException(s\"The database name is not valid: $quoted\")` on the second step. And even on the second step, the exception doesn't show actual reason as it is pretty generic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes in the case of v1 DDL commands when a database is not specified or nested databases is set.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *DDLSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *ShowTablesSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2020-12-29T11:52:03Z","updated_at":"2020-12-30T08:16:09Z","closed_at":"2020-12-30T07:52:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f086236beab50e9634a32ae4c39de18082cd1066","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30963/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30963/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30963/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ffe2b86e85ceeb48459082337a4b678cd9a2fef4","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:database-in-session-catalog","ref":"database-in-session-catalog","sha":"ffe2b86e85ceeb48459082337a4b678cd9a2fef4","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch cleans up KafkaOffsetReader API document.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFilter out the driver entity when updating the exclusion status of live executors(including the driver), so the UI won't be marked as excluded in the UI even if the node that hosts the driver has been marked as excluded.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore this change, if we run spark with the standalone mode and with spark.blacklist.enabled=true. The driver will be marked as excluded when the host that hosts that driver has been marked as excluded. While it's incorrect because the exclude list feature will exclude executors only and the driver is still active.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26694233/103238740-35c05180-4911-11eb-99a2-c87c059ba0cf.png)\r\nAfter the fix, the driver won't be marked as excluded.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26694233/103238806-6f915800-4911-11eb-80d5-3c99266cfd0a.png)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen creating an external table, if the location is not specified, an error will be reported, which
