Change Logs\r\n\r\nRemoved `HoodieSnapshotCopier` with `TestHoodieSnapshotCopier`, as it was deprecated and disabled more than 3 years ago.  \r\n\r\n`HDFSParquetImporter` was also deprecated at the same time as HoodieSnapshotCopier, and should be removed in 0.11.0. For compatibility support of hudi-cli API (import/upsert) I did not delete `HDFSParquetImporter`, but moved it from hudi-utilities to hudi-cli module (with deletion of some useless code, as it is not a separate utility anymore). Now it is used only in hudi-cli by SparkMain `IMPORT` and `UPSERT` commands.  \r\n\r\nAlso removed deprecated `HDFSParquetImportCommand` with `ITTestHDFSParquetImportCommand` from hudi-cli.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that the INSERT SQL statement with a subset of columns fails on Hudi table in Spark 3.5. The same succeeds in Spark 3.4.\r\n\r\nIn Spark 3.5, the following Resolution rules are removed, `ResolveUserSpecifiedColumns` and `ResolveDefaultColumns` (see code changes in [[org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer]] from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41262). The same logic of resolving the user-specified columns and default values, which are required for a subset of columns as user-specified compared to the table schema to work properly, are deferred to `PreprocessTableInsertion` for v1 INSERT.\r\n \r\nNote that `HoodieAnalysis` intercepts the `InsertIntoStatement` after Spark's built-in Resolution rules are applies, the logic of resolving the user specified columns and default values may no longer be applied. To make INSERT with a subset of columns specified by user to work, the custom resolution rule `HoodieSpark35ResolveColumnsForInsertInto` is added to achieve the same, before converting `InsertIntoStatement` into `InsertIntoHoodieTableCommand`.  Here's the behavior different before and after the fix on Spark 3.5, when `InsertIntoStatement` is intercepted\r\n\r\nBefore the fix, query in the relation for `InsertIntoStatement`\r\n```\r\nLocalRelation [col1#128, col2#129, col3#130, col4#131]\r\n```\r\nAfter the fix, query in the relation for `InsertIntoStatement`\r\n```\r\nProject [id#140, name#139, price#146, ts#147L, dt#137]\r\n+- Project [null AS _hoodie_commit_time#141, null AS _hoodie_commit_seqno#142, null AS _hoodie_record_key#143, null AS _hoodie_partition_path#144, null AS _hoodie_file_name#145, id#140, name#139, null AS price#146, cast(ts#138 as bigint) AS ts#147L, dt#137]\r\n   +- Project [col1#133 AS dt#137, col2#134 AS ts#138, col3#135 AS name#139, col4#136 AS id#140]\r\n      +- LocalRelation [col1#133, col2#134, col3#135, col4#136]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew tests are added in `TestInsertTable`.`\"Test Insert Into with subset of columns\"` and `\"Test Insert Into with subset of columns on Parquet table\"`.  The test on Hudi table fails before the fix and passes after the fix.\r\n\r\nReproducing the failure in Spark 3.5 (this is added as tests in `TestInsertTable`.`\"Test Insert Into with subset of columns\"` and `\"Test Insert Into with subset of columns on Parquet table\"`):\r\nCreate table:\r\n```\r\n     create table $tableName (\r\n       id int,\r\n       dt string,\r\n       name

        insert into $tableName (dt, ts, name, id)\r\n         values ('2025-01-04', 4000, 'a4', 4)\r\n```\r\nIt fails with\r\n```\r\n[INSERT_COLUMN_ARITY_MISMATCH.NOT_ENOUGH_DATA_COLUMNS] Cannot write

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Reduce listing calls required to perform table services when initializing the metadata writer. \r\n- Reduce redundant listing calls in the metadata writer\r\n- Reduce listing in clean planner\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Added some basic counters for listing in the `/metadata` directory and see over 20% reduction in listing calls in the DeltaStreamer test suite.\r\n- In case where the cleaner does not have anything to clean, we remove an extra listing call. This will apply to both data and metadata timelines.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nEnsure partitions created by async indexer are not deleted by regular writers.\r\n\r\n- Add a new metadata config to declare what metadata partitions to delete.\r\n- Fix the condition for checking whether MDT partition needs to be deleted in `HoodieTable`\r\n- Add a test in `TestHoodieIndexer`\r\n\r\nLet's understand the interplay between index enable/disable boolean flag and the new config. For illustration prupose, we will assume, `files` and column_stats` are enabled by ingestion writer, and `record_index` is created using async indexer. \r\n\r\nExisting boolean configs: `hoodie.metadata.enable`, `hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.enable` and `hoodie.metadata.record.index.enable`.\r\nNew string config: `hoodie.metadata.index.drop` (this takes the index name/MDT partition name as value)\r\n\r\n1. Regular ingestion writer has `hoodie.metadata.enable` and `hoodie.metadata.index.column.stats.enable` set to true. And, `files` and `column_stats` index are present.\r\n2. Async indexer starts with setting only `hoodie.metadata.enable` and `hoodie.metadata.record.index.enable` to true. It checks the available partitions and automatically sets the columns stats config to true as well - https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/c049e9befcbbc056aa8cdebe3c59cd8dbbfee7cf/hudi-utilities/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/utilities/HoodieIndexer.java#L182\r\n3. Indexer continues to build the record_index and that is now part of inflight metadata partitions in table config.\r\n4. Ingestion writer continue to log updates for files, column_stats, and record_index (which is already inflight a this point), while indexer catches up with ingestion writer commit. Note that at this point, regular ingestion writer does not set `hoodie.metadata.index.drop` config, so even though the `hoodie.metadata.record.index.enable` is false in ingestion writer config, the record_index is not deleted.\r\n5. Indexer has caught up. Ingestion writer notices that in addition to files and column_stats, we have record_index fully available (not inflight) in the table config. It logs updates for all 3 indexes now.\r\n6. In case users want to delete record_index in future, they need to set not only `hoodie.metadata.record.index.enable=false` but also `hoodie.metadata.index.drop=record_index`.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, there is a boolean flag for enabling.disabling an index, and there is a string config to explicitly specify what index to delete. The interplay between these two decides finally, whether index needs to be disabled/dropped or not.\r\n```\r\n(boolean, string) -> enabled\r\ntrue, null or non-matching -> true\r\nfalse, null or no-matching -> true\r\ntrue, record_index -> true\r\nfalse, record_index -> false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnsure partitions created by async indexer are not deleted by regular writers.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

There is no sense to RCA a test failed 2 years ago.\r\n\r\nAlso verified that from the point of randomness of the test data we generated, that could not affect the test stability - the test data always go to the same fixed partition path and the test just try to delete a deterministically created partition.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nbetter test coverage\r\n### Risk level (write none, low

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe culprit leads to validation issue is because instead of extracting the commit time from the data file and compare, we just treat the whole file name as a string and check if the string contains the commit instant time string. This causes issue if the commit instant time string is short (like \"002\") as the file name is generated with UUID and it can contain this string by chance.\r\n\r\nThe fix is we explicitly extract the commit time from the file name and compare, this eliminates any ambiguity of the validation we are doing.\r\n\r\nAlso we should write more informative error message, containing as many context on what we validated as possible. It saves tons of time reproducing the issue.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nfixed flaky test\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIntroduced API that correctly retrieve the table schema `getTableSchemaFromLatestCommitMetadataV2`. Compared to what we previously do it only focuses on instants that can evolve table schema. We need the rest of the RFC-82 code change to be in place in order for this API to be fully functional.\r\n\r\nAlso for inline clustering it is now hard wired to use table schema as the write schema.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nTable service will never use a wrong writer schema \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12376 - we attempted to revert the optimization for single file slice, and do the computation such as getRecordByKeys, etc. over executors even if it is for a single file slice. This means when listing files using metadata files index, even if the data partition has only one file slice, it happens over the executor and the request is sent to the timeline server (RemoteFileSystemView). However, we noticed that the timeline server did not respond and the request timed out in the case of bootstrap of a MOR table having multiple partition fields.\r\n\r\nThe PR reverts the single file slice optimisation and also fixes the test failure in TestBootstrapRead.testBootstrapFunctional. The test was failing because all spark threads are used up in the list calls for the partition.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the test coverage around the following cases:\r\n(1) For `UPDATE SET` clause in `MERGE INTO` statement, it can contain different field names from the source table, as long as the assignment clause associates the source and target table fields properly, e.g., `UPDATE SET price = source.new_price`.\r\n(2) Table schema should not be evolved in any case for `INSERT INTO` or `MERGE INTO` statements.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves test coverage on the above cases.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, If there are unresolved columns in the `MERGE INTO` statement using Hudi, currently Spark 3.5 throws the exception below which is not

Spark 3.5 (specifically from this PR [SPARK-44244] https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41788), from `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2309` to `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION`, and `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2309` is removed.  Spark 3.4 and below are not affected.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, `HoodieSpark35CatalystPlanUtils#failAnalysisForMIT` now uses `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION` error class to align with Spark 3.5, and the error message looks like behow. A new test is added to validate the behavior.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION] A column or function parameter with name new_col cannot be resolved.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nLooking up in partition stats index only for indexed cols. We take into account left and right side of expr and ensure we do lookup if its feasible if there is a mix of cols indexed and non-indexed. \r\n\r\nLets walk through an example to understand this in detail\r\n\r\nc1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\r\n\r\nSay this is the filter expression in the query issued and there is no partition predicate provided \r\n\r\ncase 1:\r\nwhen all 3 cols are indexed w/ col stats:\r\nexpected col stats lookup expression is\r\n\r\n(((('c1_minValue <= 619sdc) AND ('c1_maxValue >= 619sdc)) OR (('c2_minValue <= 100) AND ('c2_maxValue >= 100))) AND (('c3_minValue <= 200) AND ('c3_maxValue >= 200)))\r\ni.e. all 3 cols will be looked up.\r\n\r\ncase 2:\r\nonly c1 and c2 are indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nsince left of AND exp is indexed, we can ignore c3 which is not indexed (right expr of AND).\r\nwe translate to\r\n\r\n((('c1_minValue <= 619sdc) AND ('c1_maxValue >= 619sdc)) OR (('c2_minValue <= 100) AND ('c2_maxValue >= 100)))\r\nand lookup in col stats translated df.\r\n\r\ncase 3:\r\nonly c1 and c3 are indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nAmong c1 and c2, c2 is not indexed. So, left Expr of (c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100) is deemed as not indexed. But the right expr of 'c3 = 200' is indexed. and so, we translate this to\r\n\r\n(('c3_minValue <= 200) AND ('c3_maxValue >= 200))\r\nand lookup in col stats translated df.\r\n\r\ncase 4:\r\nonly c2 and c3 are indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nSame as case 3\r\nSo, we translate it to\r\n\r\n(('c3_minValue <= 200) AND ('c3_maxValue >= 200))\r\nand lookup in col stats translated df.\r\n\r\ncase 5:\r\nonly c2 is indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nSince either of Or clause is not indexed, we have to bypass looking up in col stats.\r\n\r\ncase 6:\r\nonly c3 is indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nSince either of Or clause is not indexed, we have to bypass looking up in col stats.\r\n\r\ncase 7:\r\nonly c1 is indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nSince either of Or clause is not indexed, we have to bypass looking up in col stats.\r\n\r\ncase 8:\r\nonly c2 is indexed for filter \"c1 = 619sdc or c2 = 100 and c3 = 200\":\r\nSince either of Or clause is not indexed, we have to bypass looking up in col stats.\r\n\r\nWhenever we deem as PSI (Partition stats Index) should not be looked up, we return all partitions without pruning. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Looking up in partition stats index only for indexed cols. Unnecessary overhead if cut down in partition stats lookup for non indexed files. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

enough, and class-files version is switched correspondingly.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCreated a new file format `HoodieFileGroupReaderBasedFileFormat` to support multiple base file formats, which is guarded by the existing configuration. The main change that we do is to \r\n1. create a class SparkOrcReaders for Spark3.5, Spark3.4 and Spark3.3.\r\n2. use a map to contain both orc and parquet readers and pass it to Spark file group reader.\r\n\r\nThe orc file reader implementation is based on Spark orc reader implemenation.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSupport multiple base file format: orc and parquet for Spark3.3, Spark3.4 and Spark3.5\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the logging from MDT validator to avoid oversized log message that can cause OpenSearch to throw error on indexing the logs.\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe length of [log] field of [1252665] doc of [logstash-%{[url][path]}-2024.11.29] index has exceeded [1000000] - maximum allowed to be analyzed for highlighting. This maximum can be set by changing the [index.highlight.max_analyzed_offset] index level setting. For large texts, indexing with offsets or term vectors is recommended!\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n- Introduces `StringUtils#toStringWithThreshold` to limit the size of String when converting the list of objects to String;\r\n- Improves logging in the validation of metadata listing to limit the list of metadata items to show using `StringUtils#toStringWithThreshold` or only show necessary item that causes mismatch;\r\n- Improves logging statements.\r\n\r\nNew tests are added to validate that the new logging of capping log size works.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nLogging improvement\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\nThere are 3 configs at interplay:\r\n\r\ntable config `hoodie.table.version` - can be 6 or 8\r\nwriter config `hoodie.write.table.version` - can be 6 or 8\r\nwriter config `hoodie.write.auto.upgrade` - boolean flag to control transition during upgrade, avoiding unintended upgrades.\r\n`hoodie.table.version` reflects the **actual state** of the table.\r\n`hoodie.write.table.version` defines the **intended state** of data written by the writer.\r\n\r\nDuring upgrade, the initial phase for writers should be configured with `hoodie.write.auto.upgrade=false` and `hoodie.write.table.version=6 `until when users are ready to start writing in the new format (i.e. after all readers have been upgraded).\r\n\r\nFor creating new tables using 1.0, by default i.e. when none of the writer configs are set, hoodie.table.version should be 8. `hoodie.write.table.version` is automatically inferred to be 8.\r\n\r\nWith my change that explicitly set the write version, when user does not override the config, the version would be 8 automatically.\r\n\r\nFor creating new tables using 1.0, if there is a need to create one with older format, then writers should be configured with `hoodie.write.auto.upgrade=false` and `hoodie.write.table.version=6`. In this case, hoodie.table.version should also be 6.\r\n\r\nIt means in hudi 1.0, if a user wants to create version 6 table, they would set the config above and the system should honor that configuration in metaClient.initTable. This is why this change enforces when metaClient is created, we set the table version to write version. This is what is missing without the change\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen we specify write table version as 6\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE hudi_14_table_sql_005 (\r\n    event_id INT,\r\n    event_date STRING,\r\n    event_name STRING,\r\n    event_ts STRING,\r\n    event_type STRING\r\n) USING hudi\r\n OPTIONS(\r\n    type = 'cow', -- or 'mor'\r\n    primaryKey = 'event_id,event_date',\r\n    preCombileField = 'event_ts',\r\n    hoodie.write.table.version = 6\r\n)\r\nPARTITIONED BY (event_type)\r\nLOCATION 's3://<some_bucket>/hudi_14_table_sql_005';\r\n```\r\nthe hoodie.properties said the version is 8.\r\n\r\nIt is because when building the meta client table version is not set according to the write table version. Found similar misses else where, fixed as well with test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nhoodie.write.table.version will also contribute to hoodie.table.version.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn Hudi, when scheduling Compaction and Clustering, the default behavior is to scan all partitions under the current table. When there are many historical partitions, such as 640,000 in our production environment, this scanning and planning operation becomes very inefficient. For Flink, it often leads to checkpoint timeouts, resulting in data delays.\r\nAs for cleaning, we already have the ability to do cleaning for incremental partitions.\r\n\r\nThis RFC will draw on the design of Incremental Clean to generalize the capability of processing incremental partitions to all table services, such as Clustering and Compaction.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\ncompaction and clustering\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

The table config `hoodie.record.merge.mode` is changed to have no default.\r\n- If the write merge mode (through write config or Hudi streamer command-line argument) is not set by the user, the table's merge mode `hoodie.record.merge.mode` is inferred with the following new logic:\r\n  - If the precombine field is not set, COMMIT_TIME_ORDERING is used;\r\n  - If the precombine field is set, EVENT_TIME_ORDERING is used;\r\n  - If the precombine field is not set and EVENT_TIME_ORDERING is specified by the user, the merging logic uses the default ordering value (a warning message is printed);\r\n  - If the precombine field is set and COMMIT_TIME_ORDERING is specified by the user, the merging logic still follows the COMMIT_TIME_ORDERING and ignores the precombine field set (a warning message is printed).\r\n- Flink's merging logic still uses EVENT_TIME_ORDERING by default for streaming processing.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nChanges the default merge mode to COMMIT_TIME_ORDERING without requiring precombine field set.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe'll update the config and release docs to reflect this default change when the merge mode or the precombine/ordering field is not set.  For users explicitly setting the precombine/ordering field or merge mode there is no behavior change.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-08T04:16:57Z","updated_at":"2025-01-31T05:06:33Z","closed_at":"2025-01-28T16:19:24Z","merged_at":"2025-01-28T16:19:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"4bea55a644154618b3a25dad2618b13a400dfcce","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Enabling cols stats by default on writer in SPARK engine \r\n- Added support for timestamp, Date, LocalDate, Decimal. \r\n\r\nFew features/tests where col stats is disabled:\r\n- Bootstrap feature is not yet supported. We need to fix it for whole of metadata table. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8774\r\n- Schema evolution w/ partition stats is not yet tackled in this patch. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8587\r\n- Some tests w/ test table infra does not support. Bcoz, whole premise w/ test table infra is to just mock the functionality w/ empty files. And so both col stats and partition stats are not supported. \r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8774 (more complex data types) \r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8814 Enabling col stats and partition stats by default in flink and java. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnabling col stats by default on the writer will improve query performance. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-08T01:49:43Z","updated_at":"2025-01-10T10:20:51Z","closed_at":"2025-01-10T10:20:50Z","merged_at":"2025-01-10T10:20:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"7c1431dce45a46ee5f543a42303f068968484192","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Enabling cols stats by default on writer in SPARK engine \r\n- Added support for timestamp, Date, LocalDate, Decimal. \r\n\r\nFew features/tests where col stats is disabled:\r\n- Bootstrap feature is not yet supported. We need to fix it for whole of metadata table. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8774\r\n- Schema evolution w/ partition stats is not yet tackled in this patch. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8587\r\n- Some tests w/ test table infra does not support. Bcoz, whole premise w/ test table infra is to just mock the functionality w/ empty files. And so both col stats and partition stats are not supported. \r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8774 (more complex data types) \r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8814 Enabling col stats and partition stats by default in flink and java. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnabling col stats by default on the writer will improve query performance. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-08T01:24:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-16T16:37:34Z","closed_at":"2025-01-16T16:37:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6607932904,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABid0N6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:L","name":"size:L","color":"D15409","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen NBCC or async compaction happens, there is a chance that the positions generated at the time of writing the log blocks can be inaccurate for the snapshot read or compaction at a later time due to new file slicing.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the problem is that when generating the positions, it is based on the current base file available; the snapshot read or compaction at a later time can rebase the log file onto a new base file based on the completion time-based file slicing. If the new base file is generated from the old base file with deletes in log files, the positions will be wrong, and the merging results will also be wrong.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, the proposed solution is to add the base instant time of the positions generated against to the log block header. When doing merging, if the base instant time for positions does not match the base file instant time, do not use positions for merging the records in this log block. This is simple and straightforward and can avoid any confusion if file slicing, particularly the base file, has changed for a log file and block from the time of write to the time of read.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the following code changes are made:\r\n- In `HoodieLogBlock`, a new log header metadata type is introduced for the base file instant time of record positions: `BASE_FILE_INSTANT_TIME_OF_RECORD_POSITIONS(HoodieTableVersion.EIGHT)`;\r\n- In `HoodieAppendHandle`, if the write record position is enabled, the base file instant time of the record positions is derived from the latest base file based on the file system view, and if the base file instant time exists, it is written to the log block header, and further passed down to the data or delete log block for processing (the new header metadata now determines whether record positions should be added to the log block header, without requiring an additional feature flag);\r\n- The logic of auto-disabling write record positions (`BaseHoodiewriteClient#maybeDisableWriteRecordPositions`) and callers of it are removed; as long as the record positions can be derived, the positions are written to the data and delete log blocks if the write record position feature is enabled (which is the default);\r\n- The feature of writing record positions is enabled by default (`hoodie.merge.use.record.positions` write config has default `true`);\r\n- Disables writing record positions for MDT as there is no benefit;\r\n- Code refactoring around the logic of determining whether to write record positions, which is simplified;\r\n- When instantiating file group reader buffer, if there is no base file for merging, do not use position-based merging; if there is a base file for merging, the instant time of the base file is passed to the `HoodiePositionBasedFileGroupRecordBuffer`; inside it, when the record positions need to be extracted, the logic now compares the base file instant time of the record positions from the log block header with the base file to merge in the record buffer.  If they do not match, the record positions are not used, and the merging falls back to key-based.\r\n\r\nNew tests are added in `TestHoodieLogFormat`, `TestHoodiePositionBasedFileGroupRecordBuffer` (unit tests), and `TestMORDataSourceStorage` (end-to-end functional tests).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes position-based merging to be always correct with the new log header metadata of base file instant time of the record positions.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe'll update the release doc and tech spec.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

insert query; and\r\nif its value is `none` or by default, we do not do dedup.
