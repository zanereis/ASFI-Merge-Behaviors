Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe main problem we face for delete logic is that some `DeleteRecord` do not have valid `orderingVal` field. This is not a problem for processing time based merging, but it breaks the event time based one. The fundamental solution is to ensure valid `orderingValue` field for `DeleteRecord`, which may not be possible or easy in reality. We don't attempt to achieve that in this PR. Instead we focus on making the delete logic reasonable and consistent across fg and non-fg readers, spark/avro record types. This problem is mainly for MOR table.\r\n\r\nFor a given record key RK, suppose we have a series of operations on it, like insert, update, delete, update, delete, update, etc. That is, we have a series of records, i.e., br1, lfr1, lfr2, lfr3, lfr4, etc. \r\n(1) If all records have valid orderingVal values, we can successfully merge based on event time, which is the happy path.\r\n(2) If lfr3 is a delete record without ordering value, we don't have enough information to merge it with other records based on event time. \r\n\r\nTo resolve this difficulty, we utilize a reasonable assumption: all records before this delete record, i.e., whose commit time is smaller than that of the delete record, can be considered as processing time based and removed by the delete record. But records that are newer than the delete record, can keep merging based on their event time. In this way, we combined processing time and event time in a logical way, which is universal for all Spark/Avro, COW/MOR, with FG or without FG.\r\n\r\nTo implement, we create a metadata entry \"DELETE_FOUND_WITHOUT_ORDERING_VALUE\" to indicate that a processing time based delete has been found; any further merging should be skipped.\r\n(1) For non-fg reader, we store the flag into the HoodieRecord.metadata field. For further merging, this flag is kept, which is used to skip merging with base file record.\r\n(2) For fg reader, we store the the flag into the metadata field of the record buffer. All further merging should be skipped.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMake the delete logic consistent across different record types, and fg and non-fg readers.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nDuring optimization found out that current bucketing using timestamps is wrong. Described in the comment below:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12120#issuecomment-2428125344\r\n\r\n`KeyGenUtils::extractRecordKeysByFields` is used in Flink stream processing with buckets. Optimization of this part is critical because it's called from `BucketStreamWriteFunction::processElement`, which means it's called for each record.\r\n\r\n**Before changes**:\r\n![09 - string](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a14d49f-5702-401e-8e8f-14e82a65e5c0)\r\n\r\n**After changes**:\r\n![16 - optimized extract - 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ae303ba-879b-4c89-84d5-80400fd08af9)\r\n\r\nAlso, fix for HUDI-5302 introduced complex behavior depending on combination and sequence of `,` and `:`.\r\nActually, a sequence of `,` is not supported. For instance, key `col1:val1,,,col2:val2` with hash fields `col2` will be processed in the following way:\r\n- parsed key value pair: `col1:val1`, `:null`, `:null`, `col2:val2`,\r\n- after filtering by hash fields: `:null`, `:null`, `col2:val2`,\r\n- hash calculation using `null`, `null`, and `val2`.\r\n\r\nThis is wrong behavior, because `col1` in this case has value `val1,,`, and we should skip it due to set hash fields. And use for hash `val2` only.\r\n\r\nIn the comment below, I showed, that for timestamps used for bucketing it could lead to only one bucket for all data.\r\n\r\nThis MR fix this behavior, and propose full support of `,` and `:` in composite key values.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMemory allocation optimized when buckets are used.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo need\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Removes `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView` and instead allows existing `FileSystemView` implementations to incorporate a `HoodieTableMetadata` implementation for loading the file slices.\r\n- Exposes a `fileListingBasedFileSystemView` method for constructing views that rely on file listing so it is more clear that the view is relying on file listing instead of the Hoodie Metadata Table.\r\n- Improves performance of the `SpillableMapBasedFileSystemView` by avoiding the serialization of the timeline. This allows us to use a single instance of the timeline in the view whereas before when we deserialized the value, it would be a new instance and result in increased memory usage.\r\n- Marks `DiskMap` as `AutoCloseable` so that caller can use the instances with try-with-resources. This can also help with static analysis to determine when an instance is not closed properly.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Allows users to leverage `SpillableMapBasedFileSystemView` or `RocksDbBasedFileSystemView` with the Hoodie Metadata Table which provides support for larger tables while also running with a lower memory footprint in the server running managing the table.\r\n- Improved performance for `SpillableMapBasedFileSystemView` with the improved `HoodieFileGroupSerializer`\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium, this change impacts the `FileSystemView` which is a critical component of Hudi. The changes are largely refactoring and do not change any of the core logic so I would not classify it as a high risk.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-16T03:30:38Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T03:20:31Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b72cfd7f266ef8e39a22aed99f876519f03586a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6615577906,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilG1Mg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:XL","name":"size:XL","color":"C50833","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Support bootstrapping of col stats for MOR table. \r\n- Fix clean operation with col stats. Even though stats are nullified, the records apparently were not deleted from the col stats partition. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWe could enable col stats for MOR table at any given state. \r\nRan into other issues along the way which I had to fix to get the patch ready. \r\n- DirectoryInfo was not accounting for files fetched from MDT. When a new MDT partition is initialized, to fetch file info, we poll MDT rather than doing FS based listing. This had some a bug and had to fix it. \r\n- When clean from data table is applied to MDT, we were nullifying the stats or marking it as deleted, but the record as such is not deleted from col stats partition and was lingering. Fixed the same in this patch. \r\n\r\nTests covered: \r\n- bootstrapping of both COW and MOR table. \r\n- Covered both partitioned and non-partitioned table. \r\n- Ensure log files w/ delete block, partially failed log blocks and rollback blocks are accounted for in tests. \r\n- Added tests to validate clean does remove the entry from col stats for both table types and partition and non-partitioned table. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`DataBucket::preWrite` sets new current location, using `fileID` from `DataBucket`, only for first record in the bucket. But `fileID` is set only during `DataBucket` initialization, where we use passed first record. So, we actually don't need to call `preWrite`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe delete metadata records for a restore operation. Currently, anything other than FILES and RECORD_INDEX are deleted. The method `MetadataPartitionType.shouldDeletePartitionOnRestore` holds the logic for which partitions to delete. Added a test for column stats, partition stats, sec index with files and record index.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMake index correct.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\nCurrently for HoodieStreamer, spark app name is created using `streamer-<target-table-name>`\r\n\r\n2 Different databases can have same tables & using the current spark app name convention, 2 tables with same name will end up having same spark app name.\r\nThe proposed idea to resolve this by adding a new config `--spark-app-name`.\r\n\r\nThis will make sure that existing things stays as is while providing user with a config to override spark app name\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nInstead of glob path, which might have some inefficiencies due to listing, this patch uses base file reader or HoodieUnMergedLogRecordScaner to get records (for selected columns) while building column stats. Then, the lsit of HoodieRecord is converted to Dataset<Row>. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAvoid glob path.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nReading will fail if a parquet log block for some schema evolutions.  Now we will return the records in the requested schema when reading log files. \r\n\r\nI modeled HoodieSparkParquetReader after HoodieAvroParquetReader and I reused some of the schema evolution utils that we use for reading base files in the fg reader.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAllow reading uncompacted mor table with schema evolution.\r\n\r\n(Also might fix most schema evolution issues when writing with spark records but has not been tested)\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThere are two issues with the test:\r\n\r\n1. Originally we use `insert` operation for concurrent writes. Since most of the time, these two writes have conflicts, only one write could succeed and another one fails. In such case, there are no test failures, and it is not very meaningful for the purpose of the test.\r\n2. When we use `bulk_insert` operation, two concurrent writes could both succeed; but there is a test failure. The failure is caused by the race condition between two concurrent updates on the latestSnapshot. After adding the `synchronized` keyword, the problem is resolved. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMore coverage.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCreated a new sync-tool to sync hoodie tables with [Onehouse's lakeview](https://www.onehouse.ai/product/lakeview). This also includes another set of sync-tools to sync hoodie tables in both lakeview & hive/glue. These composite sync tools will be helpful in standard Spark jobs where hudi only supports only one SyncTool.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers will be able to sync their hoodie tables with Lakeview as well. This will help users in capturing table level metrics such as table size, number of partitions, file groups etc.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocumentation update is required for detailed instructions related using LakeViewSyncTool & using it along with Hive/Glue SyncTools.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8313\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAfter #11994, the integration tests are unstable in Github CI due to larger docker image size and large disk usage causing no space on disk. This PR reduces the docker image size for docker demo and integration tests:\r\n- Removes `hadoop-2.8.4/share/doc` which contains docs only in the image.  This occupies 423MB out of 679MB in the Hadoop installation.\r\n```\r\nroot@adhoc-1:/opt/hadoop-2.8.4/share# du -d 1 -h .\r\n257M\t./hadoop\r\n423M\t./doc\r\n679M\t.\r\n```\r\n- Avoids storing Hudi bundle jars in the image which account for ~300MB.  Based on our docker demo guide and integration test flow, the bundle jars are always built based on the code base and dynamically referenced, so there is no point storing pre-built bundle jars.\r\n```\r\ntarget:\r\ntotal 314188\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root        96 Oct  5 05:54 antrun\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  43788437 Oct  5 05:24 hoodie-hadoop-mr-bundle.jar\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root

hoodie-utilities.jar\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root        96 Oct  5 05:54 maven-shared-archive-resources\r\n```\r\n- Fixes `docker/hoodie/hadoop/pom.xml` so the bundle jars are ready before copying.\r\n\r\nDocker image size comparison:\r\n| Image | Before | After |\r\n|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| base | 382.4 MB | 350.01 MB | \r\n| datanode | 382.4 MB | 350.02 MB | \r\n| history | 382.4 MB | 350.02 MB | \r\n| hivebase | 889.93 MB | 572.12 MB | \r\n| sparkbase | 1.25 GB | 965.9 MB | \r\n| sparkadhoc | 1.41 GB | 1.1 GB | \r\n| sparkmaster | 1.25 GB | 965.9 MB | \r\n| sparkworker | 1.25 GB | 965.9 MB | \r\n\r\nAll new images are pushed to the Docker Hub already:\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-base`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-datanode`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-history`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3-sparkbase_3.5.3`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3-sparkadhoc_3.5.3`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3-sparkmaster_3.5.3`\r\n- `apachehudi/hudi-hadoop_2.8.4-hive_2.3.3-sparkworker_3.5.3`\r\n\r\nImages are tested with `bullseye` tag by #12062 before pushing to the `latest` tag.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nReduces the docker image size and the size of files on disk occupied with the docker instance, making `integration-tests` in GH CI much more stable, avoiding no space on disk.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, `StreamWriteFunction` uses buffer with `DataBucket`s consisting of `DataItem`s, which are transformed `HoodieRecord`s. And when we need to flush bucket, we convert `DataItem`'s back to `HoodieRecord`s in `DataBucket::writeBuffer`.\r\n\r\nWe could use `HoodieRecord`s directly to reduce number of objects in the heap, and decrease GC workload. In a result, Flink stream write is quicker in total.\r\n\r\n|  | Before | After |\r\n| -- | -- | -- |\r\n| GC mainly related CPU samples | 66.7K | 43.6K |\r\n| Memory allocation | 2.04 TB | 2.04 TB

https://github.com/twitter/chill, this PR includes the proto one as well.\r\n\r\nAdded another class `ProtobufDynamicMessageSerializer` to handle dynamic messages as the default available in chill library uses `parseFrom(byte[]..)` method available in compiled proto messages. DynamicMessage doesn't have this method, and we need to handle this serialization through descriptors.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact on existing functionality, improving

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe [min, max] range in column stats or partition stats can keep widening with udpates or deletes, because we simply take min of all mins' and max of maxs' while merging the stats. This can lead to a degenerative case where all partitions qualify for a predicate based on stats, even though actually very few partitions meet the predicate based on actual data. It defeats the purpose of pruning/skipping using stats. To fix this problem, we need to bring the range to a tighter bound. In order to do so, this PR:\r\n \r\n1. Adds a flag in column stats metadata payload - `isTightBound` - to indicate whether min/max range is a tighter bound based on latest snapshot or not. It is false by default and set to true during compaction or clustering.\r\n2. Adds a config to disable calculating tight bounds. Enabled by default for compaction and clustering.\r\n3. To calculate tight bound, we look at the colstats partition for the uncompacted or unclustered files and then merge the colstats with that of the compacted or clustered files. Most of the changes are in `HoodieTableMetadataUtil`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMore effective partition pruning for non-partition key fields.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\nScans unmerged log records during compaction or clustering.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSame as https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/12033 for 0.x branch. \r\n- Fix Log record reading with rollback blocks having higher timestamps compared to maxInstant configured.  \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nLogRecordReader takes in a maxInstant time beyond which log blocks are ignored. But w/ rollbacks, there are chances it could lead to data consistency issues. \r\n\r\nLets go through an illustration: \r\n\r\nSay, we have t1.dc, t2.dc and t2.dc crashed mid way.  \r\nCurrent layout is, \r\n```\r\nbase file(t1), lf1(partially committed data w/ t2 as instant time)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we start t5.dc say. just when we start t5.dc, hudi detects pending commit and triggers a rollback. And this rollback will get an instant time of t6 (t6.rb). Note that rollback's commit time is greater than t5 or current ongoing delta commit. \r\nSo, once rollback completes, this is the layout.\r\n```\r\nbase file, lf1(from t2.dc partially failed), lf3 (rollback command block with t6). \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd once t5.dc completes, this is how the layout looks like \r\n```\r\nbase file, lf1(from t2.dc partially failed), lf3 (rollback command block with t6). lf4 (from t5) \r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point in time, when we trigger snapshot read or try to trigger tagLocation w/ global index, maxInstant is set to last entry among commits timeline which is t5. So, while LogRecordReader while processing all log blocks, when it reaches lf3, it detects the timestamp of t6 > t5 (i.e max instant time) and bails out of for loop. So, in essence it may even read lf4 in above scenario. \r\n\r\nThis patch attempts the fix the same. \r\n\r\nFix: \r\nWe only hold the constraint true for any data blocks and relax it for other block types. For eg, any data blocks > max instant time will be ignored. But all rollback blocks are taken into consideration. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Fix Log record reading with rollback blocks having higher timestamps compared to maxInstant configured.  \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nLogRecordReader takes in a maxInstant time beyond which log blocks are ignored. But w/ rollbacks, there are chances it could lead to data consistency issues. \r\n\r\nLets go through an illustration: \r\n\r\nSay, we have t1.dc, t2.dc and t2.dc crashed mid way.  \r\nCurrent layout is, \r\n```\r\nbase file(t1), lf1(partially committed data w/ t2 as instant time)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we start t5.dc say. just when we start t5.dc, hudi detects pending commit and triggers a rollback. And this rollback will get an instant time of t6 (t6.rb). Note that rollback's commit time is greater than t5 or current ongoing delta commit. \r\nSo, once rollback completes, this is the layout.\r\n```\r\nbase file, lf1(from t2.dc partially failed), lf3 (rollback command block with t6). \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd once t5.dc completes, this is how the layout looks like \r\n```\r\nbase file, lf1(from t2.dc partially failed), lf3 (rollback command block with t6). lf4 (from t5) \r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point in time, when we trigger snapshot read or try to trigger tagLocation w/ global index, maxInstant is set to last entry among commits timeline which is t5. So, while LogRecordReader while processing all log blocks, when it reaches lf3, it detects the timestamp of t6 > t5 (i.e max instant time) and bails out of for loop. So, in essence it may even read lf4 in above scenario. \r\n\r\nThis patch attempts the fix the same. \r\n\r\nFix: \r\nWe only hold the constraint true for any data blocks and relax it for other block types. For eg, any data blocks > max instant time will be ignored. But all rollback blocks are taken into consideration. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

there is a 50% probability that Compaction will not complete, resulting in unit test failures.\r\nOf course, the failure probability depends on the machine's performance. By increasing the wait time to 35 seconds, the success rate reaches 100%.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSignificantly reduce the failure rate of ITTestDataStreamWrite.\r\nFor example, a PR addressing the

This PR adds a test to validate the scenario mentioned in the ticket, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Writer 1 is performing an index update for a specific commit instant, fetching the latest file slices and their corresponding log files.\r\n- Writer 2 is aggressively cleaning older file slices, including log files that Writer 1 might rely on for the index update.\r\n- If Writer 2 removes file slices or log files before Writer 1 finishes the index update, there is a potential for a `FileNotFoundException`, blocking Writer 1’s operation.\r\n\r\nThe issue is fixed in the linked patch as the file system view fetched in the `getFileSystemView` call is always fresh, instead of the one that was computed when `HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter` was initialized, meaning Writer 1 should have an up-to-date view of the latest file slices and not face a `FileNotFoundException`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nTest a multi writer scenario with index update.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf hive style partitioning is enabled, then url encoding is also enabled. We need to do so otherwise the partition structure is awkward in some cases. For example, a `partition` field with values like \"dd/mm/yy\" will be written as three-level directory where the first level is `partition=dd` and then its child is `mm`, and then `yy`. \r\n```\r\npartition=dd\r\n                     |- mm\r\n                           |- yy\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith URL encoding enabled, it will be `partition=dd%2Fmm%2Fyy`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCorrect partition strucutre. However, for a small subset of users who had partitions in above format and hiev style paritioning enabled, this is going to be a physical layout change.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nDue to schema evolution, some edge cases for MIT, and spark using UTF8String, the ordering values of records can be different types. Now, we cast the ordering type into the reader type, which should be possible because of backwards compatible schema evolution.\r\n\r\nDidn't implement this for hive. But schema evolution will already cause issues for hive. We can implement those both in 1 pr in the future https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-8261\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo failure because of source ordering field type differences.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's
