BigQuery hook and operator tests and it passed.  Also did local tests that uploaded data from GCS to BigQuery using the `schema_update_options` field and also without using the field.

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-536\r\n\r\nThis issue was reported by @aoen.\r\n\r\nCurrently only a single DAG run is scheduled when a DAG file is parsed \r\nby an iteration of the scheduler loop. Which means scheduling N pending\r\nDAG runs will require N scheduler loop iterations (separated by \r\nfile_process_interval waits). Modify the logic to schedule all pending DAG \r\nruns instead.\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Added a unit test test_schedule_multiple_dag_runs that fakes the current \r\ndate to a week after the start date of the test DAG. Running a single \r\niteration of the scheduler loop should schedule 7 task instances associated \r\nwith the DAG runs for each day.\r\n- Modified unit tests test_scheduler_reschedule and test_dag_with_system_exit \r\nthat implicitly assumed a single DAG run scheduled per scheduler loop, by \r\nexplicitly faking the current date.\r\n- Created a test DAG with a start date of 2016-11-24 and ran the scheduler on\r\n2016-11-29. Verified on the tree view of the webserver that DAG runs from\r\n2016-11-24 to 2016-11-28 got scheduled.","created_at":"2016-11-29T15:32:21Z","updated_at":"2019-04-25T04:17:11Z","closed_at":"2018-09-11T22:01:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"149b7757a30d59a053193a3a0922d89c2be14331","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4a033e5642de8743252221bee565cbfb07a5a336","head":{"label":"vijaysbhat:improve_dagrun_scheduler","ref":"improve_dagrun_scheduler","sha":"4a033e5642de8743252221bee565cbfb07a5a336","user":{"login":"vijaysbhat","id":907344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/907344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat","html_url":"https://github.com/vijaysbhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70178559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDE3ODU1OQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"vijaysbhat/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vijaysbhat","id":907344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/907344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat","html_url":"https://github.com/vijaysbhat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijaysbhat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vijaysbhat/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- *(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-654)*\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Tested in the following system with wireshark: Ubuntu 16.04, Airflow 1.7.1.3, celery[auth] 4.0\r\n- No unit test because not helpful without a remote broker to test handshake\r\n- System implementations can vary, but follows celery+rabbitmq conventions\r\n\r\n\r\n- Add BROKER_USE_SSL config to give option to send AMQP messages over SSL\r\n- Should be easier to maintain and use than pub/private keys for SSH tunnels, especially in automation system\r\n- Can be set using usual airflow options (e.g. airflow.cfg, env vars, etc.) for the following vars: CELERY_SSL_KEY, CELERY_SSL_CERT, CELERY_SSL_CACERT.  Namespace chosen to be similar and differentiable to the upcoming webserver SSL patch vars, to keep in mind formal networking terms, and to be consistent with RabbitMQ

\r\n\r\nUse DAG runs to construct the list of dates to display in the tree view. The old logic used execution dates from task instances to construct the list of dates, which meant that empty DAG runs would not show up in the UI.\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Run the scheduler for the example_bash_operator DAG and clear out all task instances for a particular date (11/12 in the screenshot). Before the fix, the 11/12 DAG run doesn't show up in the tree view and after the fix, it does.

GoogleCloudStorageToBigQueryOperator and BigQueryBaseCursor to enable use of the \"schemaUpdateOptions\" when loading data into BigQuery.  The options passed to this field allow BigQuery to make modifications to a table's schema as a side-effect of an upload.  The parameter is optional and if it is not specified, it does not change the current behavior of the operator or the cursor.\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- I successfully managed to load data into BigQuery with these changes.  I also added a unit-test to verify that the checks I have in place to verify the validity of `schemaUpdateOptions` values

@artwr \r\n\r\nDear Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-633\r\n\r\nShow task instance properties in addition to task properties in the task instance view. The primary reason for this is so that we can see things like the host a task ran on without opening the log file (which is huge in the case of long-running/persistent jobs, especially e.g due to the constant airflow heartbeat). Pagination of the log would help too but this change is still necessary and a quicker win.\r\n\r\nI think ideally we want to only show an explicit subset of fields, but for now making behavior consistent with how task (not task instance) attributes are displayed. Going to merge to open source once this is merged.\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Airbnb production webserver\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1200\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-11-15 at 11 34 30 am\"

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-626\r\n\r\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs.

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- Add Stackspace to airflow users list\r\n\r\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs.

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-619\r\n\r\nIn the Gantt view, if a TaskInstance has no end_date, replace the end_date with datetime.now() before returning the result to the render so we don't call methods on None.\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\nLoad Gannt chart view of a DagRun which has running task instances, got exception before the fix.   After the fix the bar for the running task goes up to the current datetime and is correctly coded bright green.  Also verified that none of the other DAG views have a problem with running TaskInstances.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n\r\n> Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-41\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests added\r\n\r\n- Also verified in manual testing:\r\n   * Added a 60s delay in the worker loop, such that it takes 60s more time per loop to pick up a task and which amplifies the race condition.\r\n   * Configured for 6 workers in total.\r\n   * 1s scheduler loop\r\n   * After removal of ti_dep : PoolHasSpaceDep\r\n\r\nOriginal situation (with PoolHasSpaceDep):\r\n- Scheduler would send tasks to the queue for \"open minus running\" instances. If the task eventually gets picked up and sees (race condition, because multiple tasks could compete for slot) that a slot is free, it would run the task. If the slot was not free, the task would be set back to QUEUED (or SCHEDULED), anyway, returned to the scheduler for another run. In specific cases, there'd be a couple of task instances that suffer from the non-atomic read and be run anyway.\r\n\r\nIntermediate situation (without PoolHasSpaceDep):\r\n- Scheduler would send tasks to the queue for \"open minus running\" instances. All instances would get executed as long as there's a worker not doing any work.\r\n\r\nSituation as per this PR (without PoolHasSpaceDep):\r\n- The dependency is no longer needed, because the scheduler does not send instances to the executor queue unless there is a slot free. This means using open_slots = num_slots - running_slots - queued_slots.\r\n- Tested using the above 60s delay and not perceived a violation of the rule.\r\n- Benefit: PoolHasSpaceDep is a db call and consumes resources. In the previous situation, when there's a lot of 'task pressure', like many dags started or restarted, for example when a scheduler has been down for a while, it could lead to an avalanche of tasks to execute and queued for execution. Only when the dep fires, would they see the slots are full, pool oversubscription and other issues. \r\n\r\nThis cycling of tasks between scheduler -> execution -> scheduler -> etc... would continue until tasks are satisfied. \r\n\r\nIn this new situation, only the scheduler sees a very long list of tasks that should potentially be sent to an executor. This can be dealt with in other ways, for example through a \"TOP\" statement along with \"parallellism\" amount.\r\n\r\nMore info and analysis in the JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-07T20:07:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T20:42:45Z","closed_at":"2016-11-29T20:42:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"934c5390af81f28d2f5872fbf9d1dcebd51360ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1872/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1872/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1872/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/ca82319bc9f1811cd4cfe7c7cadf3ae526187abf","head":{"label":"gtoonstra:feature/AIRFLOW-41","ref":"feature/AIRFLOW-41","sha":"ca82319bc9f1811cd4cfe7c7cadf3ae526187abf","user":{"login":"gtoonstra","id":441978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/441978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra","html_url":"https://github.com/gtoonstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtoonstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e1bc5169181e7fcf6b8068f7da309c35b87a05b7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

an error condition, that apparently wasn't called. It will lead to a scheduler crash, because self.logging is not an attribute. self.logger is.)\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Tested through UI and running the scheduler (LocalExecutor mode). Results:\r\n  * max_active_runs is respected. Because the \"find\" on dagrun uses an order-by, it is safe to use the max_active_runs check as done in the code, because that forces the dagruns to be processed in order.\r\n  * Tested for max_active_runs=1 and 3. Both are processed correctly.\r\n  * Tested with 5 intermediately cleared dags. The scheduler first reprocesses those cleared dags, then continues to add more dagruns at the very end.\r\n\r\n- Unittest

accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- AIRFLOW-571\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n\r\nNo unittests added but I'm open to ideas on how to accomplish this.  This PR is adding a command line feature to pass `--forwarded-allow-ips STRING` along to gunicorn.  This fixes an issue when airflow webserver and gunicorn are run on one machine but a load balancer or reverse proxy is run on another, and https requests that are re-directed are changed to http requests.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nThis allows the webserver to run on a separate machine from a load balancer and still handle set secure headers.  It adds the option '--forwarded_allow_ips' to 'airflow webserver' and passes to value to gunicorn if present.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\nhttp://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#forwarded-allow-ips\r\n\r\nI ran into a similar problem with airbnb/caravel:

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-614\r\n\r\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-03T04:45:16Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T05:35:23Z","closed_at":"2016-11-03T05:34:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"79df26e4791ed3fee66e02608081c28f7dac188e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1866/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1866/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1866/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f208c1cea5cd59b514a4b350afce59fbeffa3f30","head":{"label":"mbreining:master","ref":"master","sha":"f208c1cea5cd59b514a4b350afce59fbeffa3f30","user":{"login":"mbreining","id":615182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/615182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining","html_url":"https://github.com/mbreining","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72708665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MjcwODY2NQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"mbreining/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbreining","id":615182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/615182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining","html_url":"https://github.com/mbreining","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbreining/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbreining/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- *(replace with a link to AIRFLOW-X)*\r\n\r\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-02T20:48:36Z","updated_at":"2016-11-08T18:14:24Z","closed_at":"2016-11-08T18:14:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0332d67daf1a4f160bc7a533eaab3983d409022","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1865/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1865/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1865/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4007c7d510ec7f4d835f84ba8b68afff16ff7483","head":{"label":"lucafuji:clean","ref":"clean","sha":"4007c7d510ec7f4d835f84ba8b68afff16ff7483","user":{"login":"lucafuji","id":1295785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji","html_url":"https://github.com/lucafuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53085439,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzA4NTQzOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"lucafuji/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lucafuji","id":1295785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU3ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji","html_url":"https://github.com/lucafuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucafuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lucafuji/airflow","description":"Airflow

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-613\r\n\r\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-11-02T20:08:00Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T15:23:58Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T20:38:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b9e2b1cfbb411d1a5fdf85e0932e781d0973849","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7191c4978f2c4943da67eaf8aa6230a812ea88c5","head":{"label":"astronomer:master","ref":"master","sha":"7191c4978f2c4943da67eaf8aa6230a812ea88c5","user":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65323404,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTMyMzQwNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"astronomer/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"astronomer","id":12449437,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNDQ5NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12449437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer","html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astronomer/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/astronomer/airflow","description":"Apache

live running postgres instance.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef test_dummy(**kwargs):\r\n    hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id='postgres_default')\r\n    conn = hook.get_conn()\r\n    time.sleep(20)\r\n```\r\nand then \r\n\r\n`SELECT * from pg_stat_activity;`\r\n\r\nfrom within postgres.\r\n\r\nThis works for DAGS and operators using the hook. If running airflow on the same pg instance, you'll get internally generated connections through sqlalchemy which will not use the same connection parameters and also won't have the application_name

Airflow Maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\r\n- *(replace with a link to AIRFLOW-X)*\r\n\r\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\r\n\r\nTesting Done:\r\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\r\nspecify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\r\ncoverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\r\n\r\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\r\n* Your PR's title must reference an issue on \r\n[Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \r\nFor example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \r\nissue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\r\n\r\n* For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\r\n\r\n* Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \r\nSummarized as follows:\r\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\r\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\r\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\r\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\r\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\r\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2016-10-31T19:25:30Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T19:26:14Z","closed_at":"2016-10-31T19:26:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1860/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1860/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1860/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/527e3ecdb8adf9d7a2f40c3ce2c30f2ccaf1924a","head":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"527e3ecdb8adf9d7a2f40c3ce2c30f2ccaf1924a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-585\n\nAtomically read all task instance states for a DAG run at the beginning of every iteration of the inner loop. This avoids race conditions that create spurious deadlocks. This is a fix for the random build failures that have been happening on Travis for some time now.\n\nHere's an example of how such a deadlock can happen - let's say we have a DAG with tasks A and B, with B dependent on A (A -> B) and A has been picked up by a worker (but not completed), which means B is not ready to run. The backfill / local executor process is actively running .\n1. Let tasks_to_run be read as [B, A] in BackfillJob._execute\n2. In the while loop, B is inspected first, and it's correctly identified as not runnable (since A hasn't succeeded yet). B is added to not_ready. Now, not_ready = [B]\n3. The backfill / local executor process gets interrupted and control is given to the worker process, which then runs task A and marks it as complete in the DB (in the TaskInstance run method).\n4. Control is given back to the backfill / local executor process that goes on to inspect task A. It calls ti.refresh_from_db, and finds A is complete, so it pops it off the tasks_to_run list. Now, tasks_to_run = [B]\n5. The following code segment in the loop incorrectly marks the DAG run as deadlocked and the backfill job is marked failed\n\nSince we are now reading the state for all task instances for a DAG run atomically, we get rid of the race condition.\n\nAlso put in additional logging to track down similar issues more easily in the wild.\n\nTesting Done:\n- All existing unit tests pass. No spurious deadlock failures on Travis yet.\n- Ran a few example backfills from the CLI\n\nI am unsure how to add an isolated unit test for this specific race condition since there are so many interacting parts.

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\n\nTesting Done:\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\n  specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\n  coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots.

issue is that `self.cli.pull()` returns `bytes()`, and not a string. Then,\nwhen we try to pass that to `json.loads()`, it raises an exception.\n\nThe fix is to convert the bytes to a string by decoding it as \"utf-8\". We're\nhardcoding the encoding because, by the JSON schema, a JSON should encoded in\nUTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. Considering we're only pulling images from Docker\nservers, we can be relatively safe that they'll behave correctly.\n\nFixes

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-561\n\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\n\nTesting Done:\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\n  specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\n  coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- For all PRs with UI changes, you must provide screenshots. If the UI changes are not obvious, either annotate the images or provide before/after screenshots.\n- Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n  Summarized as follows:\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs.

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- AIRFLOW-548\n\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\n\nTesting Done:\n- Local testing\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n  Summarized as follows:\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\n\nA recent commit has changed the scheduler behavior that it now\nalways stops after a specified period of time. The operation scripts\n(systemd etc) are not updated for this behavior and many users actually\nprefer to run the scheduler continously.\n\nSecondly the default behavior was changed to not pickup new DAGs\nimmediately, this has lead to confusion with users.\n\n@plypaul @mistercrunch @aoen @r39132 @btallman

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-139\n\nRe-posting from the JIRA comment:\n\nThis indeed causes problems with (for example) Redshift. \nI agree special cases should be discouraged though the current implementation definitely feels like a special case handling. \nThere was no issue attached to the original commit (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/commit/28da05d860147b5e0df37d998f437af6a5d4d178) but I'm supposing it came due to https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/static/release-7-4.html.\nThe documentation states:\n\"The server-side autocommit setting was removed and reimplemented in client applications and languages. Server-side autocommit was causing too many problems with languages and applications that wanted to control their own autocommit behavior, so autocommit was removed from the server and added to individual client APIs as appropriate.\"\nAs far as I can see, psycopg2 supports setting autocommit and I'd be very surprised if it didn't handle it well.\nI tested it locally and I can confirm it works well with 9.5.4 with the following code:\n\n```\n>>> import psycopg2\n>>> conn_string = \"host='127.0.0.1' dbname='db' user='user' password='pwd'\"\n>>> conn = psycopg2.connect(conn_string)\n>>> conn.autocommit = True\n>>> cursor = conn.cursor()\n>>> cursor.execute('SELECT VERSION();')\n>>> cursor.fetchall()\n[('PostgreSQL 9.5.4 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 4.9.2-10) 4.9.2, 64-bit',)]\n```\n\nIn all honesty, I'm not sure what was the purpose of the original fix and I think those lines should be removed.\n\nWith regards to tests, I can't find where tests for hooks exist at the moment and what kind of things we might want to test. Also, are there any best practices on how we test against databases if at all? I think the added code should have had unit-tests, not really sure what we might want to test by removing the code, that `Postgres.Hook.autocommit = True`?\n","created_at":"2016-10-05T12:04:32Z","updated_at":"2021-09-01T13:33:57Z","closed_at":"2017-01-24T14:52:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"235538fb27f387aa76bb23c181706d305af918e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1821/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1821/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1821/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0619a73eef7d899ddccc73388de1b3df013fb9b4","head":{"label":"Memrise:AIRFLOW-139_vacuum_operator","ref":"AIRFLOW-139_vacuum_operator","sha":"0619a73eef7d899ddccc73388de1b3df013fb9b4","user":{"login":"Memrise","id":872608,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg3MjYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/872608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Memrise","html_url":"https://github.com/Memrise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Memrise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Memrise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Memrise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Memrise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Memrise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Memrise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Memrise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Memrise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Memrise/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"365af16b4960c02f227cd797434259f7dcc706ea","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache
