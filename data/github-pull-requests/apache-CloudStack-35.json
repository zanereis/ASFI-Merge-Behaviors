Description\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- makes the global setting \"secstorage.max.migrate.sessions\" non dynamic - as it requires a restart to take effect\r\n- removes an hard-coded value being passed for CopyCommand: This is done so that concurrency can be achieved at the SSVM end. With executeInsequence being set to 'true' while from the MS end it attempts to send multiple copy requests for data migration, at the agent end, it still handles the requests sequentially. Hence, to mitigate this behavior, change has been made to fallback on what is configured on the GS for  executing in sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR  fixes: #4462\r\n\r\nProblem Statement: \r\nIn case of VMware, when a VM having multiple data disk is destroyed (without expunge) and tried to recover the VM then the previous data disks are not attached to the VM like before destroy. Only root disk is attached to the VM.\r\n\r\nRoot cause:\r\nAll data disks were removed as part of VM destroy. Only the volumes which are selected to delete (while destroying VM) are supposed to be detached and destroyed.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nDuring VM destroy, detach and destroy only volumes which are selected during VM destroy. Detach the other volumes during expunge of VM.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [x] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nTest cases covered:\r\n1.

on wrong interfaces after rebooting vpc vrs\r\nWhen add new vpc tier, create private gateway, associated IP in new range to a VPC, nics will be plugged  to VPC VRs.\r\nHowever, when reboot(or start) a VPC VR, the nics will be added by order: Public IP (source nat), other Public IP range, private gateway, VPC tiers. so the device_id of nics are different before stopping VR.\r\n\r\nI have created a PR for this issue #4467 \r\n\r\n(2) remove first public ip will remove all ips on the nic\r\nWhen use more public IPs in new public IP range (not same as source nat), a nic will be plugged to VPC VR. All public IPs used by the VPC will be attached to the nic.\r\nHowever, when we release the first public IP of the nic, it will remove the nic, all other IPs on the nic will be gone as well.\r\n\r\n(3) public ip is not marked as \"add: false\" in /etc/cloudstack/ips.json when release it.\r\nWhen use a public IP in new range to VPC VR, a nic will be plugged to VPC VR.\r\nWhen remove the public from VPC, the nic will be unplugged. however, the ip is still marked as \"add: true\" in /etc/cloudstack/ips.json\r\nso when we add a new nic to the VPC, the (old) public ip will be added back to the nic.\r\n\r\n(4) When a VPC VR is stopped, we cannot add/remove new nic to VPC VR.\r\n\r\n(5) Static NAT with multiple public interfaces uses wrong outgoing IP #4234\r\nThis is a regression of the fix for #3604 \r\nwe need to revert the commit \"Fix Policy Based Routing for private gateway static routes (#3604)\"\r\n\r\n(6) There is no ACL rule for private gateway\r\nThis is a regression of the fix for #3402 \r\nprivate gateway is changed to 'public' in commit \"vpc: set traffic type of private gateway IP to Public to fix ke… (#3851)\"\r\nso we need to add ACL rules.\r\n\r\n(7) servers in private gateway cannot reach internet via the VPC VR if it is gateway\r\nWhen add private gateway and use VPC as gateway (private gateway IP = gateway IP), the servers in private gateway network cannot reach internet via VPC VR.\r\nneed to add rule to accept packet if VPC VR is used as gateway.\r\n\r\n(8) INBOUND rules for traffic between vm and private gateway servers does not work.\r\nEven rules are added to fix bug (6), the incoming traffic between vm and private gateway network is always accepted.\r\nfor example, if the ACL of vm disallow traffic from private gateway network, vm still accepts traffic from private gateway network.\r\nneed to add rules to check the INBOUND ACL rules.\r\n\r\n(9) vm with static nat cannot connect to private gateway network.\r\nAs the fix is reverted to fix (5), the issue described in #3604 is back. \r\nthis PR introduced another way to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that

[ ] init structure need re-design. the nose override configure(self, options, conf) is not called in nose2 instead a callback is provided for cli args being passed. (preferred is config file, but our tests are to dynamicly dependent on env definition and tags)\r\n1. [ ] __init__() now is filling internal data with None, should be resonable defaults according to the nose2 doc\r\n1. [x] argline definition is changed \r\n1.

Description\r\nUpgrade of kubernetes cluster reports as successful on a shared network, when it doesn't successfully upgrade the nodes\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nPrior to the fix:\r\nDeployed a 1.16.0 k8s cluster:\r\n```\r\nk8s-master ~ # kubectl get nodes\r\nNAME         STATUS                     ROLES    AGE     VERSION\r\nk8s-master   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   master   6m23s   v1.16.0\r\nk8s-node-1   Ready                      <none>   5m51s   v1.16.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpgraded the cluster to 1.16.3, though the upgradeKubernetesCluster API returns a successful response, it doesn't upgrade the worker nodes:\r\n```\r\nk8s-master ~ # kubectl get nodes\r\nNAME         STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION\r\nk8s-master   Ready    master   8m35s   v1.16.3\r\nk8s-node-1   Ready    <none>   8m3s    v1.16.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nPost fix, once the upgrade completes i.e., when the upgradeKubernetesCluster API  returns a success response, `kubectl get nodes` shows all nodes to be at the upgraded version, here, 1.16.3\r\n```\r\nc2-master ~ # kubectl get nodes\r\nNAME        STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION\r\nc2-master   Ready    master   18m   v1.16.0\r\nc2-node-1   Ready    <none>   18m   v1.16.0\r\nc2-master ~ # kubectl get nodes\r\nNAME

'routers', 'networks', 'usage', 'accounts' tags\r\n\r\nquick-test label aims to provide quick feedback of recent changes to the developer, instead of waiting for the whole smoketest to execute(24h+). This execution lasts about 1.5h at Trillian environments.\r\n\r\nThe categories aim to offer more efficient way to slice through tests in both smoke and component tests.

Description\r\n\r\nIf a VM is started before setting the global var enable.dynamic.scale.vm to true, scaling is not possible on the specific VM until it is stopped and started again. Setting the global var before starting the VM solves the problem. The template also needs dynamic scaling enabled. But after checking those variables the VM instance would still fail due to the default max vCPUs being set to 16.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nFixes: #4237 \r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

cant reset the connection.\r\n\r\nSo change the state from PENDING to disconnected.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1.create a VPC with a tier (vpc-001-001 in vpc-001), create a vm\r\n2.create a VPC with a tier (vpc-002-001 in vpc-002) with different cidr, create a vm\r\n3.create custom gateway for both vpn\r\n4.enable site-to-site vpn on both vpn, and add vpn connection to each other. both should be \"Connected\"\r\n5.restart vpc-001 with cleanup and monitor it\r\n6.when the first router is destroyed, go to site-to-site vpn page and reset vpn connection.\r\n7.we will get an error \"Resource [DataCenter:1] is unreachable: Unable to apply site 2 site VPN configuration, virtual router is not in the right state\"\r\nand vpn connection is stuck at Pending\r\n8.When vpc

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nWhen Cloudstack selects an endpoint to do various storage-related tasks,  a dedicated host will be lower in priority.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the

changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nDedicate a host to an account and then call the prepareTemplate API -

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nCurrently the virtual router resources are not counted\r\n    towards domain resource count. Only the CPU/MEM of user\r\n    virtual machine are counted. If some customers have\r\n    VR's with higher cpu/memory values than the default value of\r\n    1 core, 256MB RAM then they are consuming extra resources\r\n    which are not counted towards the resource calculation\r\n    of the domain/account.\r\n\r\nSo two global settings are added in this change\r\n\r\n    \"resource.count.running.routers\" and \"resource.count.running.routers.type\"\r\n\r\n    \"resource.count.running.routers\" can have either true of false\r\n    \"resource.count.running.routers.type\" can have either \"all\" or \"delta\"\r\n    Default value is \"all\"\r\n\r\n    If \"resource.count.running.routers\" is true then if\r\n    \"resource.count.running.routers.type\" is \"all\" then all VR resources\r\n    are counted towards the domain resource consumption\r\n\r\n    For example: If VR is running with 4 cores, 4GB ram then all 4 cores\r\n    and 4 gb are added to domain resource consumption\r\n\r\n    If \"resource.count.running.routers.type\" is \"delta\" then the diff\r\n    between the current VR cpu/ram and default VR offering cpu/ram\r\n    is considered for domain resource calculation.\r\n\r\n    For example: If vr is running with 4 core and 4Gb ram, then\r\n    3 cores and 4gb-0.25Gb will be counted for resource consumption\r\n\r\n    If \"resource.count.running.routers\" is false then even if VR\r\n    has higher cpu/ram then its not counted towards domain resource\r\n    consumption\r\n\r\n    Test cases:\r\n\r\n    It can be tested using\r\n\r\n    nosetests --with-marvin --marvin-config=<your test config file>.cfg test_router_resources.py\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Perhaps a more\r\naggressive GC algorithm such as ParallelGC as used in Java8 and before\r\n(that is previous CloudStack releases) would serve better for throughput\r\nand cause more aggressive GC.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a change in the default GC algorithm to avoid OOM issues.\r\n\r\nReference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/gctuning/available-collectors.html#GUID-13943556-F521-4287-AAAA-AE5DE68777CD\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nPR attempts to fix and enhance the following:\r\n- On Xen, there are instances when the child snapshot is basically only a database entry with the file path pointing to the parent snapshot - handle this scenario such that a new entry is created for such incremental snapshots and delete the snapshot from source datastore during data migration\r\n- Wrt scaling down of SSVM, revised the logic to prevent quick scaling down of the SSVMs\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Added 7 entries to the cmd_exec_log table, to simulate scaling up operation - Successfully scaled - the new SSVM spawned continues to exist until the number of cmds drops below threshold\r\n2. Deleted entries from cmd_exec_log table, such that only 4 entries were present in the table - successfully triggered scale down - as the total number of cmds in the table has dropped below half the defined max limit (10/2 = 5)\r\n3. Simulated another scale up operation by adding entries to the cmd_exec log table, added entries to the second (new) SSVM however the total number of commands in the table is below threshold - does NOT scale down SSVM as a command is running on it - as expected\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-12T04:15:22Z","updated_at":"2020-11-08T19:43:54Z","closed_at":"2020-10-17T20:45:11Z","merged_at":"2020-10-17T20:45:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"0d487fc8c93037dc8625e7d811a0fb458825e9c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":928084492,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MjgwODQ0OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:Critical","name":"Severity:Critical","color":"900606","default":false,"description":"Critical

Description\r\n\r\nIf volume is migrated between storage pools and \"volume.stats.interval\"\r\nis set to more frequent interval for example 30 sec.\r\nNullPointerException is thrown, because the hypervisor is looking for\r\nvolume on storage pool from which the volume was migrated.\r\nThe statistics did not work right - before this fix only one cluster is\r\nlists if we have more clusters from the same type (eg. KVM), and only\r\none host will return volume stats. Also all volumes are sent to that\r\nhost, but they could be on another host. And the logic does not work\r\ncorrectly.\r\nAlso the response was not working correctly for QCOW2 images, because\r\nit's looking for volume's UUID, but in the statistics CS keeps the path\r\n(because of the migrated volumes which UUIDs are changed).\r\n\r\nWe have discussed the NPE with @Spaceman1984 in PR [https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/3949](url)\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWith this change all clusters will be listed even those with the same type. Host will receive only the active volumes which are on it.

Description\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/4371\r\n\r\nIn the code, all servers, and their count belonging to the same zone are returned. Then they are filtered for suitability.\r\nThis is fine except for the point where VM volumes existing on managed storage pools or hosts on which those storage pools are not suitable. In this case it removes the hosts rather than marking them as not suitable. This messes up the count. Subtracting the non suitable hosts count does not fix this since we're paginating the response so unsuitable hosts and thier count from the current page will be removed but will not fix the total count since hosts on other pages can not be filtered.\r\nAnother place is that the source host is removed from the list but the count is not adjusted\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
