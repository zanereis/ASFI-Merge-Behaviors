is a large PR covering throttled (and in general) instrumented file systems obtained from a `SharedResourcesBroker`. Luckily, a lot of the code is boilerplate and refactoring, so it's not actually THAT big.\r\n\r\nMain Changes\r\n==========\r\n\r\nImplicit Broker\r\n-------------\r\nIntroduced the concept of an implicit `SharedResourcesBroker`. This is necessary for using brokers without having to explicitly define them in the application structure, which might be too invasive. Basically, there is a singleton implicit broker whose configuration is loaded from environment variables, java properties, a configuration file in the classpath, and possibly Hadoop configuration. Furthermore, applications can inject a custom implicit broker which is thread-local and is inherited by children threads.\r\n\r\nInstrumented File Systems\r\n-------------------------\r\nChanged the previous `Instrumented*FileSystem` for a slightly different structure.\r\n\r\nAn `InstrumentedFileSystem` is a `FileSystem` decorator that instantiates a regular `FileSystem` and decorates it using a variety of `FileSystemInstrumentationFactory`s in the classpath (for example, metrics, throttling, etc.). This involves a slightly convoluted structure:\r\n* `FileSystemDecorator` is a base decorator for `FileSystem`s. It allows optionally switching the schemes in the uri. The file is very large, but it is mostly mechanical.\r\n* `FileSystemInstrumentation` is just an extension of `FileSystemDecorator` that does not switch scheme. It is intended as a base for other instrumentations.\r\n* `FileSystemInstrumentationFactory` is the actual class that should be extended for instrumentations. \r\n* `FileSystemFactory` is a `SharedResourceFactory` that builds an underlying `FileSystem`, then decorates it with any `FileSystemInstrumentationFactory`s that exist in the classpath.\r\n* `InstrumentedFileSystem` and subclasses (`InstrumentedHDFSFileSystem`, etc.) are a different convenient way of getting a `FileSystem` with instrumentations. Basically, users can either use an instrumented scheme (e.g. `instrumented-hdfs`), or use the property `fs.<scheme>.impl` to one of the instrumented file systems. The `InstrumentedFileSystem` will use the implicit broker in that context to return an instrumented `FileSystem`.\r\n\r\nThere are currently two `FileSystemInstrumentationFactory`s: `MetricsFileSystemInstrumentation` which adds metrics to all fs calls, and `ThrottledFileSystem` which adds

After diving in the code, I've noticed that in `startUp` method of `JobScheduler` there is such a piece of code: `this.scheduler.awaitRunning(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);`. That was not enough to establish the connection by Quartz which produces  stacktrace below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"GobblinHelixJobScheduler STARTING\" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Scheduler service is not running.\r\n\tat gobblin.scheduler.JobScheduler.startUp(JobScheduler.java:178)\r\n\tat gobblin.cluster.GobblinHelixJobScheduler.startUp(GobblinHelixJobScheduler.java:82)\r\n\tat com.google.common.util.concurrent.AbstractIdleService$2$1.run(AbstractIdleService.java:54)\r\n\tat com.google.common.util.concurrent.Callables$3.run(Callables.java:93)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\nCaused by: java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Timed out waiting for  [STARTING] to reach the RUNNING state.

Please let me know if it meets your standards :)","created_at":"2017-03-31T13:39:12Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T10:49:57Z","closed_at":"2017-04-04T10:47:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e36f304ca6955f2e894d5050133a9cbca5aa6195","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/6ba626210319aa8d43c71fb9dc92d3826494b367","head":{"label":"wikp:master","ref":"master","sha":"6ba626210319aa8d43c71fb9dc92d3826494b367","user":{"login":"wikp","id":1284625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODQ2MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1284625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp","html_url":"https://github.com/wikp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86816007,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjgxNjAwNw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"wikp/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wikp","id":1284625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODQ2MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1284625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp","html_url":"https://github.com/wikp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wikp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wikp/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

This is obviously not useful.\r\n* Introduced a few heuristics to the server:\r\n** If a request cannot be satisfied within timeout, return immediately.\r\n** If a request has a minimum useful permits lower than the ideal requested permits, and the ideal requested permits cannot be satisfied quickly, try to return a lower number of permits.\r\n** If the throttler is under-utilized, e.g. there are a lot of stored permits, then it may return more permits than requested.\r\n* Since Guava `RateLimiter` does not allow extension or fine control, implemented a custom `TokenBucket` algorithm.\r\n* No longer use straight `Limiter`s in the server, as the needs are different than in a client. Instead, use `ThrottlingPolicies` (which may or may not wrap a `Limiter`).\r\n* Throttling client sends an ideal and minimum number of requested

Change State to depend on this\r\n - Create a `WritableShimSerialization` class (in a different module) that implements Hadoop's Serialization interface. Update FsStateStore and ParallelRunner to add this to Hadoop serialization config.\r\n\r\n I had originally tried to solve this by creating a `WritableDecorator` that implements `Writable` and using that everywhere, but this breaks backwards compatibility.

main point of this PR is that we should throttle underlying streams instead of the streams that Gobblin replication sees. For example, if a replication flow does on-the-fly compression / decompression, we want to limit the bytes per second that are actually going through the network, not the output of compression / decompression.\r\n\r\nFew changes:\r\n* Introduce metered streams to measure bytes processed in an input/output stream.\r\n* Introduce throttled input stream that is transparently throttled, and a `StreamThrottler` to create the throttled input streams.\r\n* Added the concept of a BrokerView that allows a higher scoped immutable view of a broker. This is necessary for correct functionality of some factories.\r\n* There is no reason replication should use `FSDataInputStream`, so changed to use `InputStream` (this is a backwards incompatible change, but it was overly restrictive).\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-13T18:08:24Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T17:12:39Z","closed_at":"2017-03-14T17:12:38Z","merged_at":"2017-03-14T17:12:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"124fe055786ec9bc576cca8fd01591c7f83697d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/afd490f9743c3077f6623d391ece82232bd37727","head":{"label":"ibuenros:throttle-low-level","ref":"throttle-low-level","sha":"afd490f9743c3077f6623d391ece82232bd37727","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33570608,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3MDYwOA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"ibuenros/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contents/{+path}",

All the backups are moved to a backup directory after 2 days so that inflight queries won't get affected.\r\n5) On each shortlisted version, a cleaner/reaper will run. Cleaner for deletion of backups. Reaper for deletion of staging and moving of backups to backup directory.","created_at":"2017-03-10T08:29:07Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T03:56:14Z","closed_at":"2017-03-15T03:01:17Z","merged_at":"2017-03-15T03:01:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"ceb3bc7db2cd81e30dfef9918f3b598dd8d4e206","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"agepati","id":4252260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTIyNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4252260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agepati","html_url":"https://github.com/agepati","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agepati/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agepati/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agepati/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agepati/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agepati/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agepati/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agepati/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agepati/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agepati/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/13ee91d3e83bd98cd6d2767445d5b7b17b019b52","head":{"label":"aditya1105:retention","ref":"retention","sha":"13ee91d3e83bd98cd6d2767445d5b7b17b019b52","user":{"login":"aditya1105","id":20373170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzczMTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20373170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105","html_url":"https://github.com/aditya1105","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":71459393,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTQ1OTM5Mw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"aditya1105/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aditya1105","id":20373170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzczMTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20373170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105","html_url":"https://github.com/aditya1105","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aditya1105/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aditya1105/gobblin","description":"Universal

This will also let us hang config settings off there if we figure out there are good defaults to set.\r\n\r\nTo follow in future PRs:\r\n - Support to set GlobalMetadata from config/an arbitrary retriever\r\n - Allow sources + converters to optionally set global metadata\r\n - Per-record metadata","created_at":"2017-03-07T00:11:29Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T17:49:51Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T17:49:51Z","merged_at":"2017-03-09T17:49:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"8dd2871cef4e39ab7ed163f797f715a4ba962f31","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9d0182d6f1bb11f39cf8e46d454d5148ad53a59e","head":{"label":"eogren:metadata_pub","ref":"metadata_pub","sha":"9d0182d6f1bb11f39cf8e46d454d5148ad53a59e","user":{"login":"eogren","id":5913279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTMyNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5913279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren","html_url":"https://github.com/eogren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80959829,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDk1OTgyOQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"eogren/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eogren","id":5913279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTMyNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5913279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren","html_url":"https://github.com/eogren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eogren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eogren/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

dump, it turned out that `singleThreadPool` in `gobblin.writer.http.AbstractHttpWriter` is not shut down at all, thus it can never be reclaimed by the GC.\r\nAlso, when `gobblin.instrumented.writer.InstrumentedDataWriterBase#close` calls to `RestJsonWriter#close`, nothing happens as close is not overridden in any of RestjsonWriter, HttpWriter, AbstractHttpWriter.\r\n\r\nThe patch tries to address this issue by adding `AbstractHttpWriter#close` which calls to cleanup() to close CloseableHttpClient and ListeningExecutorService

Created a `MetricContextFactory` for broker, along with a `MetricContextKey` and a unit test.\r\n* Rest.li Limiter supports emitting metrics. The factory automatically acquires a metric context from the broker.\r\n\r\n* In Gobblin runtime, `WorkUnitState` gets a broker builder instead of a pre-built broker so it can inject its own custom configurations (not done currently). Eventually, I would want to replace all `MetricContext`s in gobblin runtime for ones acquired from the broker.\r\n* Added a scope id to the `ScopeInstance` interface.\r\n* Minor changes to generics in
