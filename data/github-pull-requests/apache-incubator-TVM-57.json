PR fixes a bug in TE ARM int8 compute for NCHWc conv2d, introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10310. The compute itself, not the schedule, is broken for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* We are using `n_elems = 8` in https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/e9091d6c68d5d70c28881e5c75bfe72e385c1f4d/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d_alter_op.py#L350. Thus, the innermost axis of the transformed kernel has extent 8: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/e9091d6c68d5d70c28881e5c75bfe72e385c1f4d/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d_alter_op.py#L375\r\n* In the TE compute, we iterate over the innermost axis `ic_s_inner` of the kernel at https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/f6f252f0abc8f621a96506739f9534083d1fe213/python/tvm/topi/nn/conv2d.py#L577. `ic_s_inner` has extent `n_elems` according to https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/f6f252f0abc8f621a96506739f9534083d1fe213/python/tvm/topi/nn/conv2d.py#L566. `n_elems` is 4 by default according to https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/f6f252f0abc8f621a96506739f9534083d1fe213/python/tvm/topi/nn/conv2d.py#L478\r\n* The ARM code that calls this compute does not explicitly pass `n_elems`, according to https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/e9091d6c68d5d70c28881e5c75bfe72e385c1f4d/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d_int8.py#L106-L108\r\n* Thus, even though the innermost axis of the kernel has extent 8, the TE compute only loops over `n_elems = 4` of the input channel dimension. \r\n\r\nInitially, I tried to keep `n_elems = 8` in alter layout and fix the intrinsic definition. But `n_elems = 8` breaks tensorization pattern matching, since now the compute is doing 4x8 innermost loop but this intrinsic is supposed to do 4x4 dot product, see https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/7896108fc41663a1fecbb52345194a93278e9e28/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/tensor_intrin.py#L467-L479. Setting `num_int8_elements = 8` there does fix the tensorize pattern matching, but the result was still incorrect.\r\n\r\nRather than fixing the intrin implementation in https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/7896108fc41663a1fecbb52345194a93278e9e28/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/tensor_intrin.py#L492 to adapt for 4x8 dot product, I settled on setting `n_elems = 4` in alter layout. It turned out this change is enough to get the correct output. Moreover, `n_elems = 8` is simply wrong for the dot product path in https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/7896108fc41663a1fecbb52345194a93278e9e28/python/tvm/topi/arm_cpu/conv2d_int8.py#L154-L155 which computes 4x4 dot product in one instruction. \r\n\r\n@tkonolige I suggest doing perf benchmark again, since the numbers in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10310 are invalid.\r\n\r\ncc @mbrookhart

PR adds a partitioning pass for cuBLAS so that supported Relay patterns can be offloaded to cuBLAS. This initial commit only adds offloading support for nn.matmul.\r\n\r\nAlthough cuBLAS is already enabled in TVM by using strategy selection in TE, by exposing it explicitly as a Relay partitioning target we can more precisely describe how to execute a model in Relay. This is desirable particularly in the Collage effort to improve multi-backend graph partitioning.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-29T19:54:38Z","updated_at":"2022-03-30T18:24:35Z","closed_at":"2022-03-30T18:24:19Z","merged_at":"2022-03-30T18:24:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2a0e1d274b7fa11a234c9633c501a5fc33db0ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/10820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/eb4c71f01ae350618b826bb5a3921442515d2850","head":{"label":"mbaret:byoc-cublas","ref":"byoc-cublas","sha":"eb4c71f01ae350618b826bb5a3921442515d2850","user":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":212343152,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTIzNDMxNTI=","name":"tvm","full_name":"mbaret/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbaret","id":55580676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTgwNjc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55580676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaret/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbaret/tvm","description":"Open

from https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9727.  When using `Stage.tensorize`, the element offset of the array view has one offset for each physical dimension of the buffer.  This change replaces `BufferNode::elem_offset` and `BufferNode::offset_factor` with arrays.  The commits in this PR are separated by category, to help in review.\r\n\r\nUpdates to Buffer class, to handle multiple elem_offsets\r\n\r\n- Includes size checks to ensure that each parameter that depends on the number of physical dimensions (`elem_offsets`, `offset_factors`, and `axis_separators`) are consistent.\r\n\r\n- Support previous Buffer constructor with a single `elem_offset` and `offset_factor`, delegating to the array-based constructor.\r\n\r\nUpdate python calls, with backwards compatibility\r\n\r\n- `Buffer.elem_offset` and `Buffer.offset_factor` are implemented as properties, to avoid breakage of calling code.\r\n\r\n- `decl_buffer` handles single or multiple `elem_offset` and `offset_factor` parameters.  The parameter name is unchanged, to avoid breaking call sites that use named arguments.\r\n\r\nUpdated TVMScript parser and printer\r\n\r\nOther C++ changes\r\n\r\n- Several other locations that referenced either `elem_offsets` or `offset_factors`, which required only minor updates to maintain existing behavior.","created_at":"2022-03-29T14:22:01Z","updated_at":"2023-02-21T15:38:15Z","closed_at":"2023-02-21T15:38:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"055eb0ce33e71adc03589000bc3cfc5b3a8aa40b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10816/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10816/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/10816/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f70d35d437d8ceca4ee458d12bdd98bddb63e10b","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:multiple_elem_offsets","ref":"multiple_elem_offsets","sha":"f70d35d437d8ceca4ee458d12bdd98bddb63e10b","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR fixes a bug of `NeedsMultiLevelTiling`, which didn't consider the effect of trivial block iterators (iterators whose domains are `[0, 1)`). Such iterators impacts the following analysis by overlargely counting the number of iterators that are not used to index the block read regions, and might lead to the application of multi-level tiling where the rule is supposed not to apply.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, we simply skip such trivial block iterators.\r\n\r\ncc @junrushao1994

Taking `[0, 1, 0]` as an example, the first `0` is `nodeid`, the second `1` is `indexid`, and the last `0` is `version`.\r\nBut in function `Run`, it only uses `0` as `indexid` in statement `uint32_t

PR is a follow-up effort of #10789, which enables the `int64` support for TIR schedule primitive Cache-Read and Cache-Write._\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the IterVars of the generated cache stage block are always `int32`-typed, which might conflict with the dtypes of the domains of the IterVars.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the dtype of new IterVars are constructed according to the data types of their

demonstrates how to selectively extract and tune tasks from a whole relay mod, and apply the tuned schedule during the final `relay.build(...)`. \r\n\r\nThis flow is entirely different from existing tests in `test_meta_schedule_tune_relay.py` where ALL ops are extracted and auto-scheduled by MS. My test extracts only int8 `dense` op, applies a manual TIR schedule on it, and leaves int8 `batch_matmul` to be scheduled by TE. \r\n\r\nThis also serves as an example of autotvm style manual template + tensorization. The manual TIR schedule is equivalent to TE VNNI `dense` schedule in

Context\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with end-to-end models, we note that some tensors may have large shapes. Thus, when designing graph-level IR, we sometimes use `int64` instead of `int32` for the shape. Below is an dense GeMM example which has `int64` input tensor shape:\r\n```python\r\n@tvm.script.ir_module\r\nclass Module:\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def main(rxplaceholder: T.Buffer[(1, 512), \"float32\"], rxplaceholder_1: T.Buffer[(T.int64(1000), T.int64(512)), \"float32\"], T_matmul_NT: T.Buffer[(1, T.int64(1000)), \"float32\"]) -> None:\r\n        # function attr dict\r\n        T.func_attr({\"global_symbol\": \"dense\", \"tir.noalias\": True, \"op_pattern\": 3})\r\n        # body\r\n        # with T.block(\"root\")\r\n        for i0_0, i1_0, i0_1, i1_1, i2_0, i0_2, i1_2, i2_1, i0_3, i1_3 in T.grid(1, 4, 1, 25, 8, 1, 10, 64, 1, 1):\r\n            with T.block(\"T_matmul_NT\"):\r\n                i = T.axis.spatial(1, 0)\r\n                j = T.axis.spatial(T.int64(1000), i1_0 * T.int64(250) + i1_1 * T.int64(10) + i1_2)\r\n                k = T.axis.reduce(512, i2_0 * 64 + i2_1)\r\n                T.reads(T_matmul_NT[i, j], rxplaceholder[i, k], rxplaceholder_1[j, k])\r\n                T.writes(T_matmul_NT[i, j])\r\n                T.block_attr({\"layout_free_placeholders\":[rxplaceholder_1], \"meta_schedule.tiling_structure\":\"SSRSRS\"})\r\n                with T.init():\r\n                    T_matmul_NT[i, j] = T.float32(0)\r\n                T_matmul_NT[i, j] = T_matmul_NT[i, j] + rxplaceholder[i, k] * rxplaceholder_1[j, k]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nThough our TVMScript printer can easily print `int64` constants, the parser had poor support for `int64`. So this PR introduces some parser support for `int64`, basically about the data type of loop variables, block iterators and block read/write regions.\r\n\r\nBesides the parser, most of the TIR schedule primitives didn't take `int64` into account in their implementations. These schedule primitives will be fixed and updated in recent future, in followup PRs.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @spectrometerHBH @junrushao1994 @jinhongyii @Hzfengsy

Added device validity check in allocation. HexagonDeviceAPI should only be called for CPU/Hexagon types.\r\n\r\n- Check for \"global.vtcm\" scope instead of \"vtcm\".  The ccope of N-d allocations produced by `LowerVtcmAlloc` should be `\"global.vtcm\"`.  The previous check allowed unsupported scope such as `\"local.vtcm\"`.\r\n\r\n- Remove `vtcmallocs` entry after calling free. Previously, the vtcm allocation map kept dangling pointers to `HexagonBuffer` objects after they had been freed.\r\n\r\n- Rename N-d alloc and free packed functions.  Since most of the similar device functions use snake case, renaming `*.AllocND` to `*.alloc_nd` and `*.FreeND` to `*.free_nd`.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Adam Straw

commit adds support for placing I/O\r\ntensors within the workspace buffer.\r\n\r\nThis is enabled using PassConfig option\r\ntir.usmp.use_workspace_io.

will plan memory for them accordingly.\r\n(i.e. it will re-use space used by them for\r\nintermediaries depending on the liveness).\r\n\r\nThis will only be supported with C Interface API.\r\nThus,

is step 1 of 2 to fix the issue where Jenkins schedules a PR rebuild on non-code changes like editing the title. When the title is changed, GitHub sends an `pull_request` webhook to GitHub. Jenkins would ordinarily look at the webhook, query the PR and checks if the commit hash for the build has already been built. However, since we have it set in the Jenkins job to merge with main before this check occurs, the commit hash is different nearly every time. Disabling that setting fixes the issue, but we still need to merge the code with `main` to ensure that the build is valid if it completes successfully.\r\n\r\nAlso see the Jenkins configuration change

PR adds `DFPattern` support for the TRT backend without removing the existing predicate registry. \r\n\r\nAdds and extends the following:\r\n* In `tensorrt.py`: Add a `pattern_table` for all the supported ops and consumes the pre-existing op_registry checks\r\n* Adds an additional pass as `unmerge_composites.cc`. This is required for the TRT backend as it expects a single primitive function to work with, while the `MergeComposite` and `PartitionGraph` will produce a single function for each `Composite` pattern. \r\n* Adds `test_inline_composites.py` which tests the newly introduced pass.\r\n\r\nBoth the pattern-based and predicate-based pass sequences produce syntactically equivalent `IRModules`.\r\nThis is to ensure backwards compatibility.\"\r\n\r\nOriginal Pass orderding: \r\n```\r\n  seq = tvm.transform.Sequential(\r\n        [\r\n            transform.InferType(),\r\n

PR makes two changes to TVM_LOG_DEBUG:\r\n\r\n1. Strips the file name in the same way it does `__FILE__`, so that users can just copy-paste full paths to files and include them in the TVM_LOG_DEBUG spec without having to know to strip the `src/` prefix.\r\n2. Changes the separator to `,` so that it can be more easily used without quoting in `docker/bash.sh` command strings, which can require a number of backslash-escapes that can be hard to determine when running commands like:\r\n`docker/bash.sh  -it ci-cpu-with-ninja /bin/bash -c 'cd build && cmake -GNinja .. && ninja && cd .. && TVM_LOG_DEBUG=src/target/target.cc=1,src/runtime/module.cc=2 python3

ONNX frontend is written to produce a dynamic graph and it is expected that the `DynamicToStatic` pass be applied after model import to make thing as static as possible. Until now we are implicitly relying on users to take this assumption into account, but I believe it is better to run `DynamicToStatic` inside the frontend since it is practically required anyway. This is especially important since in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10691 I removed the \"last minute fix-up\".\r\n\r\nFor `DynamicToStatic` to work, `freeze_param` needs to be True. So I also changed its default value, but this can be reverted if there are some concerns in making `freeze_param = True` by default (which will disable `DynamicToStatic` too).\r\n\r\n@mbrookhart

moves the sharding logic from being inlined in the Jenkinsfile to templated, so we can change just the number of shards and the test allocation in `conftest.py` and the Jenkinsfile will work to match. This also changes the test allocation from a manual balancing before to be random between shards. Each shard needs to know only its shard number and the total number of shards, then it hashes each test and skips it unless that hash falls within its allocated tests. This breaks up related tests across shards but has the downside that any change to the number of shards will shuffle around where the tests end up (but ideally this is rare as we settle on a good number of shards to use). Some tests are also manually allocated via round-robin to different shards to ensure that long-running tests run on different shards as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis only does this for the GPU frontend tests but eventually we could expand it to more.\r\n\r\ncc @areusch
