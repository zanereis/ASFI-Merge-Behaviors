PR leverages the PCollectionCache objects introduced in apache/beam#8884 and apache/beam#8961 in order to simplify implementation of CacheManager.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the CacheManager is responsible for tracking the state of every cache object that is assigned to it. This becomes progressively more difficult as we add support for more cache types, including streaming caches such as `PubSubBasedCache`. In the proposed implementation, the CacheManager is dictionary mapping string labels to cache instances, with a few helper methods to simplify the creation of new cache objects. A few minor changes are made to `InteractiveRunner` and `PipelineAnalyzer` in order to accommodate this change.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n- I am not 100% set on the proposed `CacheManager` API. The main purpose of this PR is to demonstrate that inclusion of `PCollectionCache` objects can lead to code removal and simplification in other parts of the code base.\r\n- I am a bit perplexed by the changes I had to make to `sdks/python/scripts/generate_pydoc.sh`. Please let me know if there is a simpler way to get the docs tests to pass.\r\n\r\nR: @aaltay @udim @KevinGG\r\nCC: @ivant @ananvay \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a developer building a client for monitoring running jobs via the JobService, I want the ability to get a list of submitted jobs – particularly their job ids – so that I can use this as an entry point

now, the idea is that these *datatype_inference* functions would only be used for tests, so that we don't have to write out the coder, the avro schema, the fastavro schema, and the parquet schema for every PCollection that we are testing.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it may be nice to make these functions more robust such that they can be used by default in Beam pipelines when the user does not explicitly provide a schema.\r\n\r\nFor example use-cases of where these functions are used, see: apache/beam#8884.\r\n\r\nCC: @ivant @ananvay\r\nR: @udim \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n1. Added interactive_beam module that will serve sugar syntax and\r\nshorthand functions to apply interactivity and visualize \r\nPCollection data.\r\n2. This commit implemented the implicitly managed Interactive Beam\r\nenvironment to track definition of user pipelines. It exposed a watch()\r\ninterface for users to explicitly instruct Interactive Beam the \r\nwhereabout of their pipeline definition when it's not in __main__.\r\n3. This commit exposed a PCollection data exploration interface\r\nvisualize(). Implementation is yet to be added.\r\n4. Added interactive_environment module for internal usage without\r\nbackward-compatibility. It holds the cache manager and watchable\r\nmetadata for current interactive environment/session/context. Interfaces\r\nare provided to interact with the environment and its components.\r\n5. Unit tests included.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a subtle problem with unnamed records in Avro and Java -- they can be used to correctly serialize/deserialize binary data as long as nobody counts on serializing/deserializing the actual Avro schema as a JSON string.\r\n\r\nThis *can* work if both reader and writer can infer the schema from another source (like the Beam Schema), but is certain to break when passing the schema or record to a transform that expects the schema to meet the Avro specification.\r\n\r\nMore discussion at: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-2492\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that no anonymous Avro records will be created as part of translating a Beam schema.\r\n\r\n*N.B.* Credit goes to @iemejia for this implementation, I just cleaned up the tests.\r\n\r\n*N.B.2* I get _some_ minor credit :D  There were some bugs with potential namespace collisions.  The internal implementation here should be very close to what Spark does with auto-generated Avro schemas.\r\n\r\nR: @reuvenlax @kanterov \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

review tries to address BEAM-7678. When we use typehints in the output the `element_type` is already defined so in theory there is no need to try to infer it. There are some types that cannot be inferred by the function `infer_output_type`, in these cases the typehint should be used to bypass the inferred type.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to test this code, I can reproduce the issue in a manual test, using as type a class that for some reason the `infer_output_type` is not able to infer.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

do not merge this before merging PR 9185 and PR 9198. \r\n\r\nThis PR has two commits in addition to PR 9185 and PR 9198. The first one implements BeamCostModel and wires this cost model to the planner in BeamSQLTransform path. It also adds beamComputeSelfCost method for all the classes, and tests that the CalciteQueryPlanner is using our cost model and the cost model behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nThe second PR makes implements beamComputeSelfCost for all the nodes. All of them are simple methods using NodeStats estimations of the node and its inputs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
