Also added a 'timestampfield' option so the event time source field can be specified on the command line (using the processing time is not helpful for batch processing modes).  If existing command line and/or environment variables remain unchanged then the batch profiler will continue to read profile definitions from the file system.  \r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* zookeeper and timestampfield command line options were added to the batch profiler (The batch profiler utilises the same Metron API to pull profile definitions from zookeeper as Stellar does).\r\n* The wrapper script for batch profiler was updated to support the new options. To support this the wrapper script now passes command line options to the underlying program.\r\n* The Readme file were updated to document the new options.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nUnit tests added for additional parameter handling.  A Metron dev cluster was manually spun up to test reading of profile information.  As the batch profiler now utilises the same API as Stellar does to read profile information,  it also leverages the same testing that is setup around the Stellar engine.  Documentation markdown rendering was checked utilising the Intellij Markdown module, as I was unable to get site-book building running on MacOS.\r\nTravis CI testing run completed successfully on private repo.\r\n\r\n### Manual Testing\r\n\r\n1. Deploy a single VM Developer deployment.\r\n1. Manually install Spark2 via Ambari.\r\n1. Vagrant SSH to login to the developer box.\r\n1. Source /etc/default/metron\r\n1. Create the profile definition in a file located at $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/profiler.json. \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"hello-world\",\r\n      \"onlyif\":  \"exists(ip_src_addr)\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n      \"init\":    { \"count\": \"0\" },\r\n      \"update\":  { \"count\": \"count + 1\" },\r\n      \"result\":  \"count\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n\"timestampField\": \"timestamp\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n1. `cd $METRON_HOME`\r\n1.  Push the profile to zookeeper via `bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i config/zookeeper/ -z $ZOOKEEPER`\r\n1.  Enable zookeeper profile reading via `export SPARK_PROFILER_USE_ZOOKEEPER=1`\r\n1.  `bin/start_batch_profiler.sh`\r\n1.  Scan the produced log entries for an entry similar to the following to confirm correct reading of a profile from Zookeeper\r\n```\r\n19/05/01 06:55:48 INFO BatchProfilerCLI: Utilising profile: org.apache.metron.common.configuration.profiler.ProfilerConfig@40e10ff8[profiles=[org.apache.metron.common.configuration.profiler.ProfileConfig@1433046b[profile=hello-world,foreach=ip_src_addr,onlyif=exists(ip_src_addr),init={count=0},update={count=count + 1},groupBy=[],result=ProfileResult{profileExpressions=ProfileResultExpressions{expression='count'}, triageExpressions=ProfileTriageExpressions{expressions={}}},expires=<null>]],timestampField=foo]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1253\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's not possible to write or paste a valid date to a date selector powered input field. This PR has been intended to solve this inconvenience. Please make sure you add a valid date format which is `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`\r\n\r\nTesting locally\r\n==========\r\n\r\n1. Start the Metron Alerts UI\r\n2. Go to `http://localhost:4201/alerts-list` in the browser\r\n3. Open the date range selector floating pane at the upper right\r\n4. In the floating window, try to manually write or paste valid date formats within the accepted time range (In the two input fields on the left side of the floating window)\r\n5. It should be nicely done. 🙌\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2067\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nThese deps changes are test scope, so it really shouldn't need a fulldev run, however we've been making a vast number of changes to our project structure recently and I wanted to proceed with added caution. Full dev topologies worked with no signs of error for me.\r\n\r\n* Build should pass. This is removing duplicate dependencies from a couple pom files.\r\n* Verify data flows through to indexing in full dev, no exceptions in the profiler.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2066\r\n\r\n**Testing/Validation**\r\n\r\n* Look over the documentation changes in metron-common and parsers and make sure they look sound. There were some odd issues, e.g. sensorTopic was defined as being an output topic, but it's the input topic for the parsers.\r\n* Spin up fulldev and verify that yaf outputs the pattern it loaded along with a note about which path was used during initialization.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a minor bug that fails to honor the `outputTopic` parser configuration setting and adds a unit test to cover this method.  I slightly refactored the `ParserTopologyBuilder` class to make this feature easier to test.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and ensure bro, snort and yaf data is landing in the `enrichments` topic with the Kafka console consumer tool:\r\n```\r\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --topic enrichments\r\n```\r\n2. Update the bro parser configuration to write to a custom output topic:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.bro.BasicBroParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"bro\",\r\n  \"outputTopic\": \"bro_test\"\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/config/bro'\r\n```\r\n3. Update the snort parser configuration to write to a custom output topic:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.snort.BasicSnortParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"snort\",\r\n  \"outputTopic\": \"snort_test\"\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/config/snort'\r\n```\r\n4. Update the yaf parser configuration to write to a custom output topic:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.GrokParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"yaf\",\r\n  \"outputTopic\": \"yaf_test\",\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n    \"grokPath\": \"/patterns/yaf\",\r\n    \"patternLabel\": \"YAF_DELIMITED\",\r\n    \"timestampField\": \"start_time\",\r\n    \"timeFields\": [\r\n      \"start_time\",\r\n      \"end_time\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"dateFormat\": \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.S\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"fieldTransformations\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"input\": [\r\n        \"protocol\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"output\": [\r\n        \"protocol\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"transformation\": \"IP_PROTOCOL\",\r\n      \"config\": {}\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/config/yaf'\r\n```\r\n5. Restart the parser topology component in Ambari.\r\n6. After the topology has started back up, there should be 3 new `*_test` topics:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --list\r\n__consumer_offsets\r\nbro\r\nbro_test\r\nenrichments\r\nescalation\r\nindexing\r\npcap\r\nsnort\r\nsnort_test\r\nyaf\r\nyaf_test\r\n```\r\n7. These new topics should all have data written to them while the `enrichments` topic should no longer be written to.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe initial purpose of this PR is to explain the cause of the problem described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2061 and facilitate discussion on an optimal solution.  A solution is presented here but I expect we will explore other solutions as well.  \r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nDate type fields are a problem for our `UpdateDao` classes because of the logic used to update documents.  Currently the process is this:\r\n\r\n1. Get the latest document using either the Elasticsearch or Solr client API.  This document is returned as a Java object.\r\n2. Convert both the document object and patch object to a `JsonNode` object using Jackson.  This includes serializing/deserializing the objects internally.\r\n3. Apply the patch using the `JsonPatch` API.\r\n4. Convert the patched `JsonNode` back to a document object.\r\n5. Index the document object into Elasticsearch or Solr.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the date type is lost during serialization.  Jackson automatically converts it to epoch long by default: https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.7/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/SerializationFeature.html#WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS.  There is also an option of converting the value to a date string.  The error happens because the original date field now contains a long when a document is indexed.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solutions\r\nI think there are several ways to solve this problem and I will present some options here.  Others are welcome to propose additional solutions.\r\n\r\n1. Add special handling for date fields - We could detect date fields and handle the conversion.  We would need to manage the Jackson date format and ensure it lines up with the date format Elasticsearch or Solr expects.\r\n2. Handle the patch with a custom utility (the initial solution in this PR) - The JSON Patch specification (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) is fairly simple and straightforward.  Instead of using a 3rd party library that requires `JsonNode` objects and serialization/deserialization, we could apply the patches directly to the objects.\r\n3. Partial updates - I believe both Elasticsearch and Solr provide support for partial updates.  In this case we would only need to handle date type fields when those specific fields are being updated.\r\n\r\nI chose option #2 because it is simple and avoids any future document field type issues.  I believe we should move away from the `JsonPatch` API and serialization/deserialization altogether because there is potential for other Jackson issues and it is inefficient.  This rules out option #1 for me.  Option #3 is attractive for obvious reasons but may require significant changes to our API.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe initial solution included here has been tested in full dev.  We can use this test script regardless of the solution we choose.\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and enable Solr using the instructions in the metron-solr README.\r\n2. Stop the Storm topologies.  This will make it easier to isolate our test to a single document.\r\n3. Pick a schema and add a date type field to it:\r\n```\r\n<field name=\"timestamp_solr\" type=\"iso_timestamp\" indexed=\"true\" stored=\"true\" />\r\n<fieldType name=\"iso_timestamp\" stored=\"true\" indexed=\"true\" multiValued=\"false\" class=\"solr.TrieDateField\" sortMissingLast=\"false\" docValues=\"true\"/>\r\n```\r\n4. Clear out the collection corresponding to the changed schema and index a document with a `timestamp_solr` value:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"guid\":\"some-guid\",\r\n  \"source.type\":\"yaf\",\r\n  \"timestamp_solr\":\"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI did this using the \"Documents\" menu item in the Solr UI at `http://node1:8983`.\r\n\r\n5. Attempt to patch an unrelated field:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PATCH --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"guid\": \"some-guid\",\r\n  \"patch\": [\r\n    {\"op\":\"add\",\"value\":\"DISMISS\",\"path\":\"/alert_status\"}\r\n  ],\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"yaf\"\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/update/patch'\r\n```\r\nThis request should succeed without error and the updated document should be returned with the new field.  Before this PR a 500 error was returned with a message similar to:\r\n```\r\nError from server at http://node1:8983/solr/yaf: Invalid Date String:'75231198000'\r\n```\r\n6. This can also be tested in the Alerts UI by filtering on the guid and changing the status in the details panel.\r\n\r\n### Outstanding Issues\r\nOnce we land on a solution I will add comprehensive tests and proper Java documentation.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original ASF Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2058\r\n\r\nYou can perform batch operations on alerts in the alerts ui. once you have selected one or multiple alerts (by clicking on the checkbox on the right) you can perform these batch operations. In order to do that you have to open the \"Actions\" dropdown below the alerts list and on the right side of the screen. \r\n\r\nPreviously, when you clicked on \"Add to alert\", it opened the right pane even though it was disabled because there were no alerts selected (and it made it clear by showing the proper cursor icon).\r\n\r\nFrom now on, if the user clicks on a disabled element within the dropdown, nothing happens.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original ASF Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2062\r\n\r\nWe accidentally committed fdescribe (focused describe) tests and pushed it to the master. Focused describe means that the test runner only runs those tests within the fdescribe block and miss the rest of them.\r\n\r\nIn order to tests it just run `npm test` in the metron-alerts folder and make sure all the tests are ran and passed.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

current LDAP support provided in Metron uses an attribute containing a SHA-encoded password to perform a remote password compare to authenticate users.  We should support bind authentication which is commonly used in an LDAP\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. There was already a field in Ambari that is used to define the name of the attribute that contains the SHA-encoded password to perform a remote password compare for user authentication.  If the user wants to perform bind authentication, they should leave this field blank in Ambari.\r\n\r\n1. I updated the descriptions of some of the LDAP fields in Ambari to provide a more detailed description of what is required.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tested this against an Active Directory server over both LDAP and LDAPS.  I needed bind authentication to authenticate against Active Directory in these scenarios.\r\n\r\nI also tested this against OpenLDAP by following these steps.\r\n\r\n1. Deploy this code in an environment like Full Dev.  \r\n\r\n1. Create an LDIF file to your local workstation at `/tmp/ldif/test.ldif`.\r\n\r\n    <details><summary>test.ldif with groups `acme_user` and `acme_admin`</summary>\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    version: 1\r\n\r\n    # Please replace with site specific values\r\n    dn: dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n    changetype: add\r\n    objectclass: organization\r\n    objectclass: dcObject\r\n    o: Hadoop\r\n    dc: hadoop\r\n\r\n    # Entry for a sample people container\r\n    # Please replace with site specific values\r\n    dn: ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n    changetype: add\r\n    objectclass:top\r\n    objectclass:organizationalUnit\r\n    ou: people\r\n\r\n    # entry for sample user metron admin\r\n    dn: uid=admin,ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n    changetype: add\r\n    objectclass:top\r\n    objectclass:person\r\n    objectclass:organizationalPerson\r\n    objectclass:inetOrgPerson\r\n    cn: Admin\r\n    sn: Admin\r\n    uid: admin\r\n    userPassword:{SSHA}DzE0WdguvPfBGXkoYSztB3DoXPRrT4LB\r\n\r\n    # entry for sample user sam\r\n    dn: uid=sam,ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n    changetype: add\r\n    objectclass:top\r\n    objectclass:person\r\n    objectclass:organizationalPerson\r\n    objectclass:inetOrgPerson\r\n    cn: sam\r\n    sn: sam\r\n    uid: sam\r\n    userPassword:sam-password\r\n\r\n    # entry for sample user tom\r\n    dn: uid=tom,ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n    changetype: add\r\n    objectclass:top\r\n    objectclass:person\r\n    objectclass:organizationalPerson\r\n    objectclass:inetOrgPerson\r\n    cn: tom\r\n    sn: tom\r\n    uid: tom\r\n    userPassword:tom-password\r\n\r\n    # create FIRST Level groups branch\r\n    dn: ou=groups,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n    changetype: add\r\n    objectclass:top\r\n    objectclass:organizationalUnit\r\n    ou: groups\r\n    description: generic groups branch\r\n\r\n    # create the admin group under groups\r\n    dn: cn=acme_admin,ou=groups,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n    changetype: add\r\n    objectclass:top\r\n    objectclass: groupofnames\r\n    cn: acme_admin\r\n    description:admin group\r\n    member: uid=admin,ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n\r\n    # create the user group under groups\r\n    dn: cn=acme_user,ou=groups,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n    changetype: add\r\n    objectclass:top\r\n    objectclass: groupofnames\r\n    cn: acme_user\r\n    description: user group\r\n    member: uid=sam,ou=people,dc=hadoop,dc=apache,dc=org\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n1. Launch a container running an LDAP server.\r\n    ```\r\n    docker run \\\r\n      -p 33389:389 \\\r\n      --name metron_ldap_demo \\\r\n      --env LDAP_ORGANISATION=Hadoop \\\r\n      --env LDAP_DOMAIN=apache.org \\\r\n      --env LDAP_TLS_FALSE \\\r\n      --volume /tmp/ldif:/container/service/slapd/assets/config/bootstrap/ldif/custom \\\r\n      osixia/openldap:1.2.2 --copy-service\r\n    ```\r\n1. In Ambari make the following changes under Metron > Config > Security > Roles.\r\n\r\n    * Set \"User Role Name\" to \"ACME_USER\".\r\n\r\n    * Set \"Admin Role Name\" to \"ACME_ADMIN\".\r\n\r\n1. In Ambari make the following changes under Metron > Config > Security > LDAP.\r\n\r\n    * Turn on LDAP using the toggle.\r\n\r\n    * Set \"LDAP URL\" to `ldap://10.0.2.2:33389`.  Use the externally addressable IP from the previous step.\r\n\r\n    * Set \"Bind User\" to `cn=admin,dc=apache,dc=org`.\r\n\r\n    * Set \"Bind User Password to `admin`.\r\n\r\n    * Set \"User password attribute\" to empty or blank.  This will ensure that bind authentication is used, rather than performing a remote password comparison using the value of that attribute.\r\n\r\n1. The following user/password credentials can be used to test authorization.\r\n\r\n    * admin/admin-password\r\n    * sam/sam-password\r\n    * tom/tom-password\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that authorization is working.\r\n\r\n    * Ensure that you can login to the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n    * Ensure that you can login to Swagger.\r\n\r\n    * Ensure that the `/whoami/roles` endpoint returns the correct roles.\r\n\r\n    * Ensure that only the admin user can delete settings in the Alerts UI with the [`DELETE /api/v1/alerts/ui/settings`](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-interface/metron-rest#delete-apiv1alertsuisettings)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-04-01 at 1 14 21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/55346426-72cb8b80-5480-11e9-9298-45101474d5ec.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2055\r\n\r\nThe build on Travis is failing because of an unzipping issue during the Cypress installation process. You can find more about this issue and track it [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3515).\r\n\r\nWhile we are waiting for the Cypress team to address this issue, I've removed it from our project dependencies and build process. I also updated a handful of packages with `npm audit fix` in order to address some high level vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nYou should be able to inspect the Travis logs from this build and see that the Cypress tests have been removed from the build process.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR I changing default query time range on Alerts UI from \"All time\" to \"Last 15 minutes\". Some of our users reported performance issues when they used \"all time\" time range hence the relatively large amount of queried alert records.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Clone this branch locally.\r\n- Navigate to metron-interface/metron-alerts, run scripts/scripts/start-dev.sh\r\n- Open the Alerts UI at localhost:4201.\r\n### Assert\r\n- selected time range after login is \"Last 15 minutes\"\r\n- from and to datetime is visible on the bottom of the time range button\r\n- query (magnifier icon) returns with the proper set of results\r\n- make sure selected time range impacts polling (play icon)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nI was able to track down the problem in the `SolrMetaAlertRetrieveLatestDao` class.  Every time the latest meta alert is retrieved in `SolrMetaAlertRetrieveLatestDao.getLatest`, a new `SolrClient` is being created and never closed.  This issue also happens when updating a meta alert because the latest version of the meta alert is retrieved first.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, the `SolrClient` created in `SolrDao` is now shared with all child Dao classes.  Some slight refactoring was needed to achieve this and I tried to keep it as consistent with other `SolrDao` classes as possible.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n1. Spin up full dev and create a meta alert:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"alerts\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"guid\": \"f130166c-ba0d-4ecd-8395-eaea8aa950fe\",\r\n      \"sensorType\": \"bro\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"groups\": [\r\n    \"string\"\r\n  ]\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/metaalert/create'\r\n``` \r\n2. Record the number of active zookeeper connections by first getting the REST PID:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 tmp]# ps -ef | grep metron-rest\r\nmetron   18151     1  7 00:59 ?        00:01:36 /usr/jdk64/jdk1.8.0_112/bin/java -Dhdp.version=2.6.5.0-292 -cp /etc/hadoop/conf/:/usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/conf:/usr/metron/0.7.1/lib/metron-rest-0.7.1.jar:/usr/metron/0.7.1/lib/metron-parsing-storm-0.7.1-uber.jar:/usr/metron/0.7.1/lib/metron-solr-0.7.1-uber.jar org.apache.metron.rest.MetronRestApplication --spring.config.location=/usr/metron/0.7.1/config/rest_application.yml,classpath:/application.yml --server.port=8082 --spring.profiles.active=dev --index.dao.impl=org.apache.metron.solr.dao.SolrDao,org.apache.metron.indexing.dao.HBaseDao --meta.dao.impl=org.apache.metron.solr.dao.SolrMetaAlertDao --index.writer.name=solr\r\nroot     20411   566  0 01:21 pts/0    00:00:00 grep metron-rest\r\n```\r\nThen print the number of connections for that PID:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 tmp]# netstat -nape | awk '{if ($5 == \"::ffff:127.0.0.1:2181\") print $9;}' | sort | uniq -c | grep 18151\r\n      2 18151/java\r\n```\r\n3. Update the created meta alert `alert_status` field  several times with different values:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PATCH --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"guid\": \"f8da66bc-0d26-4f90-9d93-4689e70e9ce3\",\r\n  \"index\": \"metaalert\",\r\n  \"patch\": [\r\n   {\"op\":\"add\",\"path\":\"/alert_status\",\"value\":\"DISMISSED\"}\r\n  ],\r\n  \"sensorType\": \"metaalert\"\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/update/patch'\r\n```\r\n4. Printing the number of zookeeper connections should continue to be 2.  Before this the number of connections would continue to grow as updates are sent.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nIn this PR I introducing Cypress in Config UI and adding a Cypress test to cover Grok parser creation. I made a simplified common test setup across Config and Alert UI to bring them to the same platform.\r\nThe changeset might seem big, but most of the new files are contains configs or mock data.\r\n\r\nThe list of changes are the following:\r\n- bumping Cypress version to 3.2.0 (it solve former issues yauzl/cypress binary unzipping)\r\n- adding Cypress to Config UI\r\n- using standard ng serve command to fire up both Alert and Config UI's for testing \r\n- adding Grok Parser creation test\r\n\r\n\"Full Dev\" vm build tested and works fine.\r\n\r\n## Steps to validate\r\n\r\nPlease check build logs in Travis CI to see the output of the [UI tests](https://travis-ci.org/tiborm/metron/jobs/510929760).\r\n\r\nUnder [this link](https://travis-ci.org/tiborm/metron/jobs/502000711) you can find a build failing where I intentionally broke a test to see whether it breaks the build too.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2043\r\n\r\nThis PR piggybacks off of the work in:\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1345\r\n2. https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1358\r\n\r\nSee the originating conversation for this PR here - https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1358#issuecomment-474527445\r\n\r\nNote - I was able to remove the need to modify our license dependencies and maintain the flatfile_loader grabbing its hadoop/hbase deps directly from the provided distribution at runtime rather than having to bundle them directly. I also removed the assembly.xml from metron-profiler-client as all assembly-related work happens in other profiler modules.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nI need to finish testing with the Stellar REPL, but preliminary tests on streaming enrichment and the flatfile_loader look good. Both work without error.\r\n\r\nFollow test steps from:\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1345\r\n2. https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/432#issuecomment-276733075\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1856\r\n\r\n## About the feature\r\n\r\nThe use is able to group individual sensors together. The purpose of it is being able to start/stop or enable/disable sensors of the same kind. It's for the sake of convenience. \r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\nGo to a sensor list screen and simply grab a sensor and drop it on another. There's a grid icon that indicates the fact that the row is draggable. Grab the grid and move it around. By doing to this, you can aggregate two sensors. After that, a pane appears where you can add the name of the two groups. You can also add a description as a reminder about what's going on. \r\n\r\nThen you'll the newly created group and the two aggregated sensors below. The purple rectangles next to the group name are for pointing out that they're groups obviously. The sensors that belong to a particular group are listed below. There's a dash at the beginning of the row to show the connection between the group and the sensors.\r\n\r\nOnce sensors are grouped together you're unable to perform operations on them individually. You can only perform operations on the group. \r\n\r\nOnce a group is created, you can add as many sensors to it as you want. \r\n\r\nYou can only add sensors to stopped or disabled groups.\r\n\r\nYou can only aggregate stopped or disabled sensors together.\r\n\r\nIf a sensor belongs to a group, you can remove it by dragging and moving it out from the group's area.\r\n\r\nYou can edit the group name and the description anytime by clicking on the pen icon on the right.\r\n\r\nIt could be hard to notice but it's possible to put a sensor between two already grouped sensors inside a group. There's a blue line between rows to make it obvious.\r\n\r\nIt's very important to point it out that the result of the aggregation is not immediately persisted on the backend. You have to click on the \"APPLY\" button at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nDifferent colors for each row mean different updates:\r\n\r\n- Red: Group or sensor is deleted\r\n- Yellow: Group or sensor has been changed\r\n- Green: New item in the list\r\n\r\nOnce the changes are persisted after hitting the Apply button, the colors disappear.\r\n\r\nYou can undo all of your updates since the latest save by clicking on the \"DISCARD ALL\" button next to the APPLY button.\r\n\r\n## Important Blocker\r\n\r\nThis PR cannot be merged back to master until @merrimanr is done with the related updates of the backend part of the parser aggregation feature. Until then, I close this PR and reopen it once he's done.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Go to the`metron-alerts` folder\r\n- Run `npm ci`\r\n- Run the development environment as you would normally do\r\n- Go to `http://localhost:4200/sensors` in your browser\r\n- Play with the new features described above\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR updates the query generated from the time select control to work with both Elasticsearch and Solr.  Before this query would be generated and only worked with Elasticsearch:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"indices\": [],\r\n  \"facetFields\": [],\r\n  \"query\": \"(timestamp:(>=1552674515000 AND  <=1552674815000) OR metron_alert.timestamp:(>=1552674515000 AND  <=1552674815000))\",\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"size\": 25\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe same query fails in Solr with an `Invalid Number` exception.  Now the same query is generated with syntax that works in both:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"indices\": [],\r\n  \"facetFields\": [],\r\n  \"query\": \"(timestamp:[1552539600000 TO 1552625999000] OR metron_alert.timestamp:[1552539600000 TO 1552625999000])\",\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"size\": 25\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI have verified this in full dev with Solr.  Navigate to the Alerts UI and select a filter in the time widget (just to the left of the search icon).  The search should return a 200 instead of a 500.  The syntax was tested directly against REST in a separate cluster with Elasticsearch.  Testing in full dev with Elasticsearch is still needed.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

enrichment loader fails when run as an MR job on YARN. It runs successfully when run in local mode.  See [METRON-2038](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2038) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n#1345 unexpectedly changed how Maven packages the `metron-data-management` JAR even though  #1345 was completely unrelated to `metron-data-management`.\r\n\r\n#### Why did #1345 impact `metron-data-management`?  \r\n\r\nThis is due to the problematic dependency on `metron-enrichment` from other projects like `metron-data-management`.  This can cause dependency changes in unrelated projects like `metron-profiler-client` to impact completely unrelated projects like `metron-data-management`.  This problematic dependency chain is in the process of being cleaned up as part of other ongoing work.\r\n\r\n#### Why did the enrichment loader not work in MR, but work in local mode?\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs because Maven packaged `org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HBaseConfiguration` in the `metron-data-management` jar, even though HBase is marked as a `provided` dependency.  This really should not be packaged in the JAR, but I have been unable to determine why Maven was doing this.\r\n\r\nWhen the enrichment loader is executed by the `flatfile_loader.sh` script, a large number of HBase dependencies are added at runtime.  The underlying MR code requires a different, conflicting version of this class. Unfortunately, it would find the conflicting `org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HBaseConfiguration` class definition in the `metron-data-management` jar rather than in its runtime dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### How was this fixed?\r\n\r\nRather than load the HBase dependency at runtime, now we package the HBase dependency in the JAR and do not add any of these dependencies at runtime.  This approach avoids the conflict and helps ensure that the integration tests run more similarly to how the tool is used in production.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nFollow the steps to replicate from [METRON-2038](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2038) in Full Dev.  Ensure that the enrichments are loaded to the enrichments table in HBase.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to original ASF ticket: https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2029?filter=-2\r\n\r\nPreviously, when a user opened the configure table panel, they would have to scroll down to see all the available column choices. This list can be really long and require a lot of scrolling and parsing for a user to find what they are looking for.\r\n\r\nI added a simple filter so a user can more easily find the column they are looking for by either their original name or the display name they can optionally give a column.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n1. Clone this branch locally.\r\n1. Navigate to `metron-interface/metron-alerts`, run `npm ci` and then `scripts/scripts/start-dev.sh`\r\n1. Open the Alerts UI at localhost:4201.\r\n1. Click on the gear icon to open the configure table panel.\r\n1. Type in the filter to narrow the choices down.\r\n1. To test the display name, add a display name to an existing column choice, click save at the bottom of the configure table panel, reopen the panel and try filtering with the term being the display name. It should be included in the results.\r\n1. To clear the filter and reset the filtered results to include all available columns, click on the 'x' on the right hand side of the filter input.\r\n1. You can find unit tests for this feature inside the `configure-table.component.spec.ts` file and run them with `ng test`.\r\n\r\nClick on the gif below to see an expanded view of the filter in action.\r\n\r\n![filter-example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/54284109-a614ac00-459f-11e9-8f30-de606974f67b.gif)\r\n\r\n## Further Considerations\r\n\r\nCurrently, if a display name exists on a column, the filtering logic will only check against the display name. This was intentionally written on my part because I felt if a user renames a column with a display name, they are going to be searching for that column by display name.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

change allows a user to map groups defined in LDAP to the roles used internally in Metron.  \r\n\r\nFor example, currently you must define a role named 'admin' in LDAP to grant administrative access.  With this change that LDAP group can be named whatever you like.\r\n\r\nThis is not currently a limitation with traditional LDAP because the group can be nested under a tree dedicated to Metron.  This is more preparation for the introduction of Active Directory support.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Created a Spring Security `GrantedAuthoritiesMapper` that maps the groups in LDAP to the roles defined in Metron.\r\n\r\n* The mapper can be manually customized in `rest_application.yaml` as follows.\r\n    ```\r\n    authorities:\r\n      user: METRON_USERS_AT_ACME_CO\r\n      admin: METRON_ADMINS_AT_ACME_CO\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* The mapper setting defaults to the original `ADMIN` and `USER` roles which ensures the change is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n* The Mpack was also updated to allow a user to configure these role mappings.  There is an additional \"Roles\" panel under Metron > Config > Security where the user can customize this.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-03-13 at 11 51 10 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/54293555-9177ea00-4586-11e9-95ff-7fddbbbe14a8.png)\r\n\r\n* Updated the REST README to include instructions for setting up LDAP.  I also added a table of contents and reorganized the content a bit to be more consistent.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThese instructions are heavily borrowed from @jleet [here](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1246#issuecomment-433175628).\r\n\r\n1. Deploy this code in an environment like Full Dev.  \r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nThe metron alert UI by default searches for everything, on login.\r\nIt also has a default refresh rate of 1 min.\r\n\r\nThis search is activated every time a user login to metron alerts UI. This is causing a heavy load on elastic search and as a result, slows down the RA indexing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the 1-minute refresh rate sends another search request even before the first search results are returned.\r\n\r\nWe have to wait for the first query to finish before changing the refresh rate.\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR I fixing this issue by turning off polling by default (actually there was a previous atempt to turn it off but it had bug) and eliminating inital search request after login.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Clone this branch locally, spin up the Alerts UI manually by navigating to the alerts directory (metron-interface/metron-alerts) and running scripts/start-dev.sh, then navigate to localhost:4201\r\n- Make sure there is no search request sent automatically after login\r\n- Make sure polling is paused by default (there should be a 'play' icon on the top right of the page to start polling)\r\n\r\nPlease review and merge if you find it ok!\r\nThx\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR includes the necessary changes to move Storm-dependent code to a separate module.  In most cases classes were moved unchanged with the exception of the package changing from `org.apache.metron.common.utils.*` to `org.apache.metron.storm.common.utils.*`.  More complex changes are listed in the next section.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- Removal of Storm and Flux Maven dependencies from the metron-common pom file.\r\n- Additional of the `org.ow2.asm:asm:5.0.3` Maven dependency to metron-common pom file.  This dependency was inherited from the Storm dependencies.\r\n- Created a new metron-storm-common module for classes migrated out of metron-common.\r\n- Refactored the `RawMessageUtil` and `MetadataUtil` classes to separate Storm dependent code.  The `MetadataUtil.extractMetadata` method's purpose is to extract metadata from a tuple and should be in metron-storm-common while the other methods in `MetadataUtil` I believe are reusable and should be kept in metron-common.  For now I moved `RawMessageUtil` to metron-storm-common and moved the method to `RawMessageUtil.extractMetadata`. \r\n- Removed the `TopologyContext` parameter from `BulkMessageWriter.init` and adjusted implementations to match.\r\n- All `BulkMessageWriter` implementations did not use `TopologyContext` except for `HdfsWriter`.  This class is tightly coupled to Storm dependencies and will likely need to be rewritten without them for other streaming platforms.  In this PR, it's treated as a special case in `BulkMessageWriterBolt` with the `TopologyContext` call in a separate `HdfsWriter` method.\r\n- Storm-dependent classes and tests were moved from metron-common to metron-storm-common including:\r\n  - Classes in the `org.apache.metron.common.bolt` package\r\n  - `MessageGetStrategy` interface and implementations\r\n  - `RawMessageUtil` including the `extractMetadata` method\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI have done some basic testing in full dev.  I've spun it up and made some basic assertions:\r\n- Data is flowing to ES and HDFS\r\n- No topologies are reporting errors\r\n- All components are showing green in Ambari\r\n- REST is functioning including all endpoints\r\n- UIs are working\r\n- Streaming enrichments are working in Stellar (https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1345)\r\n- Streaming enrichments are working in the Storm enrichment topology\r\n\r\nTo test streaming enrichments in the enrichment topology:\r\n1. Add an ip address that matches the bro data set to the 'user' enrichment set up in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1345:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> msgs := [\"user1,192.168.66.1\"]\r\n[user1,192.168.66.1]\r\n[Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n1\r\n```\r\n2. Add the enrichment to the bro enrichment config:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"enrichment\": {\r\n    \"fieldMap\": {\r\n      \"geo\": [\r\n        \"ip_dst_addr\",\r\n        \"ip_src_addr\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"host\": [\r\n        \"host\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"stellar\": {\r\n        \"config\": {\r\n          \"enrichment\": \"ENRICHMENT_GET('user', ip_src_addr, 'enrichment', 't')\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"fieldToTypeMap\": {},\r\n    \"config\": {}\r\n  },\r\n  \"threatIntel\": {\r\n    \"fieldMap\": {\r\n      \"hbaseThreatIntel\": [\r\n        \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n        \"ip_dst_addr\"\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"fieldToTypeMap\": {\r\n      \"ip_src_addr\": [\r\n        \"malicious_ip\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"ip_dst_addr\": [\r\n        \"malicious_ip\"\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    \"config\": {},\r\n    \"triageConfig\": {\r\n      \"riskLevelRules\": [],\r\n      \"aggregator\": \"MAX\",\r\n      \"aggregationConfig\": {}\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"configuration\": {}\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/enrichment/config/bro'\r\n```\r\n3. Verify there are no errors in the enrichment topology and that the new `enrichment` field appears in the bro index.\r\n\r\n### Outstanding Issues\r\n- I think we could improve on the `MetadataUtil` refactor.  Should we rename `RawMessageUtil` to something more appropriate?  Should we reorganize that code differently?\r\n- Is the `HdfsWriter` approach good enough?  How else could we do this?\r\n- Is `metron-platform/metron-storm-common` the right module for common Storm code?\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nIn this PR I introducing Cypress in Config UI and adding a Cypress test to the Config UI to cover Grok Parser Creation. To do this I made a simplified common test setup across Config and Alert UI to bring them to the same platform.\r\nI also had to remove maven-frontend-plugin to fix issues we faced with on Travis while we tried to add cypress to Config UI project.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe list of changes are the following:\r\n- adding Grok Parser creation test\r\n- removing additional test server solution from Alert UI\r\n- using standard ng serve command to fire up both Alert and Config UI's for testing \r\n- removing maven-frontend-plugin, excluding UI from maven install and test loops and letting tests run on Travis's own node.js (the issue was deeply investigated and this is the only way to fix issues in the cypress install phase)\r\n- introducing shell script to execute UI tests\r\n\r\n## Steps to validate\r\n\r\nPlease check build logs in Travis CI to see the output of the UI tests.\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/apache/metron/jobs/502040547\r\n\r\nUnder [this link](https://travis-ci.org/tiborm/metron/jobs/502000711) you can find a build failing where I intentionally broke a test to see whether it breaks the build too.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nIn this PR I introducing Cypress in Config UI and adding a Cypress test to the Config UI to cover Grok Parser Creation. To do this I made a simplified common test setup across Config and Alert UI to bring them to the same platform.\r\nI also had to remove maven-frontend-plugin to fix issues we faced with on Travis while we tried to run UI test by mvn.\r\n\r\nThe list of changes are the following:\r\n- adding Grok Parser creation test\r\n- removing additional test server solution from Alert UI\r\n- using standard ng serve command to fire up both Alert and Config UI's for testing \r\n- removing maven-frontend-plugin, excluding UI from maven install and test loops and letting tests run on Travis's own node.js (the issue was deeply investigated and this is the only way to fix issues in the cypress install phase)\r\n- introducing shell script to execute UI tests\r\n\r\nPlease check the logs of the following build task to see the output of the UI tests:\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/tiborm/metron/jobs/501548088\r\n\r\nUnder [this link](https://travis-ci.org/tiborm/metron/jobs/502000711) you can find a build failing where I intentionally broke a test to see whether it breaks the build too.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds the logging improvements listed in the Jira.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- Updated the metron-rest pom.xml file to use Log4j2 with SLF4J.\r\n- Added an exception handler to properly log 400 errors\r\n- Removed old log4j.properties files\r\n- Added classes for logging Http request and response information\r\n- Documentation for configuring log levels added to the REST README\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and navigate to Swagger\r\n2. Monitor the REST log by logging into full dev and tailing the log:\r\n```\r\ntail -f /var/log/metron/metron-rest.log\r\n```\r\n3. Logging should appear to be set at ERROR level initially.\r\n4. Verify 400 errors are now properly logged by sending a bad request:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' -d '{\r\n  \"filterClassName\": {}\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/config/test'\r\n```\r\n5. Navigate to Ambari > Services > Metron > Configs > REST and locate the \"Metron Spring options\" setting.  Change it to `--logging.level.org.apache.metron.rest=INFO --logging.level.org.springframework.web.filter.CommonsRequestLoggingFilter=DEBUG --logging.level.org.apache.metron.rest.web.filter.ResponseLoggingFilter=DEBUG` and restart REST.\r\n6. As the application restarts, there should be INFO level logging for Metron REST code.\r\n7. Verify Http request and response information is logged by sending a request:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/global/config'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a REST endpoint that manages parser groups in the global config.  The endpoint exposes CRUD operations for a new `SensorParserGroup` object used to store a group name, description and sensor list.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n- `SensorParserGroup` type was added.\r\n- Method added to `ParserConfigurations` for converting the objects stored in the global config to an array of `SensorParserGroup` objects.\r\n- REST classes added to support CRUD operations (`SensorParserGroupController`, `SensorParserGroupService`, `SensorParserGroupServiceImpl`).\r\n- Logic added to the existing `StormAdminServiceImpl` and `StormStatusServiceImpl` classes for converting a `SensorParserGroup` to the corresponding Storm topology name.\r\n- The `parser_commands.py` Ambari mpack script was updated to sort the sensors before starting/stopping topologies.  This is needed so that both Ambari and REST can correctly generate a topology name from a list of sensors.\r\n- Slightly refactored `ParserTopologyCLI` to use a constant sensor separator.\r\n- Added tests and javadocs where appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Changes NOT Included\r\n- The `ParserTopologyCLI` still expects a comma-separated list of sensors when starting a topology.  The concept of a `SensorParserGroup` is limited to REST at this point.  We could add group name support to `ParserTopologyCLI` but I don't see a requirement.  If desired I believe this should be a follow on.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and verify data is flowing to ES.\r\n2. Create a sensor group:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n\"description\": \"group1 description\",\r\n\"name\": \"group1\",\r\n\"sensors\": [\r\n\"bro\",\"snort\",\"yaf\"\r\n]\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/group'\r\n```\r\nA 201 status with the new group should be returned.\r\n\r\n3. Create another group:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n\"description\": \"group2 description\",\r\n\"name\": \"group2\",\r\n\"sensors\": [\r\n\"jsonMap\",\"jsonMapQuery\"\r\n]\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/group'\r\n```\r\n4. Get all groups and verify both groups are returned:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/group'\r\n```\r\n5. The groups should also be visible in the global config:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/global/config'\r\n```\r\n6. Verify a group can be retrieved by name:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/group/group1'\r\n```\r\n7. Try to create a new group with a sensor that is already contained in another group:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n\"description\": \"group3 description\",\r\n\"name\": \"group3\",\r\n\"sensors\": [\r\n  \"bro\"\r\n]\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/group'\r\n```\r\nYou should get an error with an obvious and descriptive message.\r\n\r\n8. Try to create a new group with a sensor that does not exist:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n\"description\": \"group3 description\",\r\n\"name\": \"group3\",\r\n\"sensors\": [\r\n  \"test\"\r\n]\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/group'\r\n```\r\nYou should get an error with an obvious and descriptive message.\r\n\r\n9. Try to create a group with an empty sensor list:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n\"description\": \"group3 description\",\r\n\"name\": \"group3\",\r\n\"sensors\": [\r\n]\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/group'\r\n```\r\nYou should get an error with an obvious and descriptive message.\r\n\r\n10. Delete a group:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X DELETE --header 'Accept: */*' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/group/group2'\r\n```\r\nYou should get a 200 and the group should no longer be in the global config.\r\n\r\n11. Try to delete the same group again:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X DELETE --header 'Accept: */*' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/group/group2'\r\n```\r\nYou should get a 404 since the group no longer exists.\r\n\r\n12. Navigate to Ambari > Metron > Configs > Parsers and change \"Metron Parsers\" to `\"yaf,bro,snort\",squid`.  This will test the Ambari change to ensure sensors are sorted in the job name and multiple topologies are still supported.  Restart the Parser component.\r\n13. Verify that both the `bro__snort__yaf` and `squid` topologies are running with the Storm UI.\r\n14. Get the topology status with REST for `group1` that contains the `bro`, `snort` and `yaf` sensors:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/storm/group1'\r\n```\r\nAn `ACTIVE` status should be returned.\r\n\r\n15. Verify the `group1` topology can be successfully stopped with REST:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/storm/parser/stop/group1?stopNow=true'\r\n```\r\n16. Verify the `group1` topology can be successfully started with REST:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/storm/parser/start/group1''\r\n```\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

... 7 more\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe Stellar REPL is being launched in a manner that pulls in multiple conflicting versions of Guava.  Guava 17 was being used by `metron-management` and `metron-parsers-storm`, but the `metron-profiler-client` was unexpectedly pulling in Guava 12 through the `metron-hbase` project.\r\n\r\n* Altered the Profiler Client so that it does not depend on Guava.\r\n* Excluded Guava from any Profiler Client dependencies.\r\n* Removed unnecessary Hadoop dependencies from the Profiler family of projects.\r\n* Ensure that Netty 4.1.13 is explicitly being pulled in for the Elasticsearch integration tests.  \r\n* Guava relocations now use a standard prefix, which includes the version number; `org.apache.metron.guava.${guava_version}`\r\n\r\n### What's Lacking?\r\n\r\n* We do not have any automated tests that would have caught this issue.  To do that we would need some tests that exercise the REPL after it is launched using the $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar script along with the deployed shaded JARs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n#### End to End\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Launch the development environment and ensure that telemetry is visible within the Alerts UI.  \r\n\r\n#### Streaming Enrichment\r\n\r\n1. Create a Streaming Enrichment [by following these instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/06/16/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+6%3A+Streaming+Enrichment).\r\n\r\n1. Define the streaming enrichment and save it as a new source of telemetry.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    {\r\n      \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\",\r\n      \"writerClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.enrichment.writer.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter\",\r\n      \"sensorTopic\": \"user\",\r\n      \"parserConfig\": {\r\n        \"shew.table\": \"enrichment\",\r\n        \"shew.cf\": \"t\",\r\n        \"shew.keyColumns\": \"ip\",\r\n        \"shew.enrichmentType\": \"user\",\r\n        \"columns\": {\r\n          \"user\": 0,\r\n          \"ip\": 1\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    [Stellar]>>>\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PARSER\", conf, \"user\")\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Management UI and start the new parser called 'user'.\r\n\r\n1. Create some test telemetry.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msgs := [\"user1,192.168.1.1\", \"user2,192.168.1.2\", \"user3,192.168.1.3\"]\r\n    [user1,192.168.1.1, user2,192.168.1.2, user3,192.168.1.3]\r\n    [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n    3\r\n    [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n    3\r\n    [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n    3\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that the enrichments are persisted in HBase.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.1', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n    {original_string=user1,192.168.1.1, guid=a6caf3c1-2506-4eb7-b33e-7c05b77cd72c, user=user1, timestamp=1551813589399, source.type=user}\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.2', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n    {original_string=user2,192.168.1.2, guid=49e4b8fa-c797-44f0-b041-cfb47983d54a, user=user2, timestamp=1551813589399, source.type=user}\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.3', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n    {original_string=user3,192.168.1.3, guid=324149fd-6c4c-42a3-b579-e218c032ea7f, user=user3, timestamp=1551813589402, source.type=user}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n#### Profiler\r\n\r\n1. Test a profile in the REPL according to [these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-repl#getting-started).\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> values := PROFILER_FLUSH(profiler)\r\n    [{period={duration=900000, period=1723089, start=1550780100000, end=1550781000000}, profile=hello-world, groups=[], value=4, entity=192.168.138.158}]\r\n    ```\r\n \r\n1. Deploy that profile to the Streaming Profiler.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\", conf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Wait for the Streaming Profiler in Storm to flush and retrieve the measurement from HBase.  \r\n\r\n    For the impatient, you can reset the period duration to 1 minute. Alternatively, you can allow the Profiler topology to work for a minute or two and then kill the `profiler` topology which will force it to flush a profile measurement to HBase.\r\n\r\n    Retrieve the measurement from HBase.  Prior to this PR, it was not possible to query HBase from the REPL.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"192.168.138.158\",PROFILE_FIXED(30,\"DAYS\"))\r\n    [2979]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Install Spark using Ambari.\r\n\r\n    1. Stop Storm, YARN, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Kafka.\r\n\r\n    1. Install Spark2 using Ambari.\r\n\r\n    1. Ensure that Spark can talk with HBase.\r\n        ```\r\n        cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml /etc/spark2/conf/\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n1. Use the Batch Profiler to back-fill your profile.  To do this, follow the direction [provided here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-spark#getting-started).\r\n\r\n1. Retrieve the entire profile, including the back-filled data.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"192.168.138.158\",PROFILE_FIXED(30,\"DAYS\"))\r\n    [1203, 2849, 2900, 1944, 1054, 1241, 1721]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWith the addition of https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1190, the Alerts UI can now update state using the object returned from a REST update call.  This PR updates the Alerts UI to do that.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  \r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and navigate to the Alerts UI\r\n2. Open an alert and change the status from \"NEW\" to \"OPEN\".  After closing the detail panel the status for that alert should show as \"OPEN\" in the list view.\r\n3. Create a metaalert and search for the metaalert so that is shows up in the list view.  Add an alert to that metaalert by checking the checkbox next to an alert and using the \"Add to Alert\" option in the \"Actions\" dropdown.  The count next the the metaalert in the list view should increment by 1.\r\n4. Remove an alert from the metaalert.  The count next to the metaalert should decrement by 1 and the alert should be removed immediately.\r\n5. Other update functions in the UI should be tested to ensure there are no regressions:  adding/deleting a comment, changing a metaalert name, etc.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

appears that the repository that we have configured to pull in the dependency `multiline-string` is no longer accessible.  I am unable to build Metron because of this.\r\n\r\n* The repository at `https://raw.github.com/benelog/multiline/master/maven-repository` is no longer accessible. I am not sure how long this repository has been inaccessible.\r\n\r\n* This likely went unnoticed for some period of time because the dependency is cached in most developer environments.  Once I cleared my Maven cache, I ran into this problem.\r\n\r\n* The Multiline project's documentation indicates that the package should be pulled from the [JCenter repository](http://jcenter.bintray.com).  See the [Multiline project's documentation for Maven.](https://github.com/benelog/multiline/wiki/Maven-project-with-Eclipse#step-2--add-the-dependency-in-maven).\r\n\r\n* We already have JCenter configured as a repository for the project.

Contributor Comments\r\nAdded a whole lot of Javadoc and fixed stuff based on checkstyle. People should double check that it's correct, I took an admittedly fairly quick pass in the interest of improving it, but it's quite possible I overlooked things or made mistakes.  Some of the older stuff occasionally can be a little murky if you don't already know how it hooks together (which I definitely do not)\r\n\r\nFrom metron-platform/metron-common, `mvn site site:stage-deploy site:deploy`. Open up `file:///tmp/metron/site/metron-platform/metron-common/checkstyle.html`.  There should be no JavaDoc warnings anymore.\r\n\r\nOther than newlines and other minor formatting here and there, code shouldn't be touched. I wanted to avoid touching it as much as possible for a purely doc oriented set of changes.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nMost of the motivation here is to spur discussion about what we want to do.  I changed everything to UTF-8. Because UTF-8 is usually a solid default.\r\n\r\nEverything with default charset now uses `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` (with the occasional variant of `StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name())`.\r\n\r\nI've done a few things here\r\n* An IntelliJ driven automatic fix for \"Implicit usage of the platform's default charset\". This fixes the vast majority of issues.\r\n* An IntelliJ driven automatic fix for \"Standard Charset object can be used\". This replaces a few \"UTF-8\" strings that were floating.\r\n* Manual replacements for `PrintStream`, `FileReader`, and `FileWriter`.\r\n** `PrintStream` just requires modifying the args slightly (need to include `autoFlush` in params).\r\n** `FileReader` and `FileWriter` do not accept encoding arguments and are drop in replaced with variants that do.\r\n* A pass for issues that error-prone caught that IntelliJ didn't. These were typically something like, `\"\".getBytes()` that were in our tests.\r\n* Changing the POM to throw compiler errors on default charset issues. Otherwise, it's gonna keep cropping up, at least until our build is substantially cleaner.\r\n\r\nAs a nice side effect, the build logs are cleaner now that error prone isn't squawking on every default charset.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nI believe these regressions happened when upgrading Angular:\r\n\r\n- The `responseType` needs to be set to `string` for any REST calls that return a String type.  I also fixed `kafka.service.ts` even though it's not directly related to this issue.\r\n- The `grokStatement` type was incorrectly changed from string to Object in `sensor-parser-config.component.ts` so I changed it back and handled casting it in the callback.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  Before this fix opening either a squid or yaf sensor would throw an error about not being able to load the grok statement from HDFS or the classpath.  After this fix you should be able to open either sensor with the grok statement correctly loaded and displayed.  You should also be able to create a new Grok sensor and have the pattern label automatically populated with the sensor name.\r\n\r\n### Outstanding Issues\r\n- Fixing this subsequently causes an \"Expression has changed after it was checked\"  error in the browser console.  I believe the offending line is [here](https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-interface/metron-config/src/app/sensors/sensor-parser-config/sensor-parser-config.component.html#L200).\r\n- I have not updated or run the unit tests yet\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis commit adds back in code coverage via JaCoCo, and bumps the version and makes it a variable.\r\n\r\nNot sure why it broke on the old code, it built fine for me now. Hopefully, it does the same in Travis.\r\n\r\nIf you want the run the entire shebang to get a nice site (at /tmp/metron/site/index.html), run:\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install site site:stage-deploy site:deploy\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'll take awhile, it's doing the whole build including tests and so on, followed by doing all the site deploy stuff.\r\n\r\nYou can just do a `mvn clean prepare-package` on a module (e.g. metron-platform/metron-common), which should run the tests, and drop the JaCoCo report in `target/site/jacoco/index.html` for the particular module.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2005 has more info, but the short story is that file rotations were incorrectly creating extra 0-byte files.\r\n\r\nThis adds a bunch of logging used while debugging the issue, along with a couple minor changes / cleanups (e.g. making sure to close the SourceHandlers that were removed, etc.).\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the problem without this PR, in the Ambari config for Metron go to Indexing and set `HDFS Rotation Policy Units` and `HDFS Rotation Policy Count` to something small (e.g. a couple minutes). You should see 0 byte files being produced.  The format of a file name is `enrichment-hdfsIndexingBolt-3-0-1550181963674.json`.  The `-0-` is the rotation number.  All nonzero rotation numbers will be 0-byte files, while all zero rotation numbers will contain data.\r\n\r\nWith the PR, all files should have a zero rotation number (with further explanation in the JIRA, as noted before). The file should change as expected still, e.g. for a 2 minute rotation, you'll see something like \r\n```\r\n[metron@node1 ~]$ hdfs dfs -ls /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/*\r\nFound 5 items\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 storm hadoop    5852029 2019-02-14 22:40 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/enrichment-hdfsIndexingBolt-3-0-1550181964099.json\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 storm hadoop    2950408 2019-02-14 22:50 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/enrichment-hdfsIndexingBolt-3-0-1550184487351.json\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 storm hadoop     736045 2019-02-14 22:52 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/enrichment-hdfsIndexingBolt-3-0-1550184609455.json\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 storm hadoop     765852 2019-02-14 22:54 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/enrichment-hdfsIndexingBolt-3-0-1550184732852.json\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 storm hadoop     588054 2019-02-14 22:54 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/enrichment-hdfsIndexingBolt-3-0-1550184855769.json\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the latest two dates may be the same (e.g. in the example, there are two `22:54`. This is because one file is closed and done, and the newer one was just opened and hasn't been completed yet. Once closed the second one will be `22:56`).\r\n\r\nThe main change to tests was just to remove a unit test that showed handling of a now incorrect state. I added a fairly basic test to ensure rotation actions and the callback are called, but I'm definitely open to new tests if anyone has any suggestions on what they'd like to see.\r\n\r\nI also had to add stellar-common as a dependency.  I hadn't changed anything that would have broken that, but still was failing tests locally.  I thought it was a transitive dependency, but I'm surprised it broke now. I'm open to thoughts about it.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWe are currently on an alpha version of Bootstrap in the Alerts UI which includes deprecated class names and values. This PR upgrades the version of Bootstrap to the latest stable release (4.2.1) and replaces/updates deprecated classes and values.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nClone this branch locally, spin up the Alerts UI manually by navigating to the alerts directory (metron-interface/metron-alerts) and running `scripts/start-dev.sh`, then navigate to localhost:4201. Visually compare this with the current version on master. There are small changes in padding in margin because bootstrap shifted away from px values to rem values, but everything else should look the same.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the score slider with an ace editor to highlight Stellar syntax. From now on users can set the score by adding a Stellar expression. It's backward compatible so the user still can add numbers as scores but they have to type it instead of setting the slider.\r\n\r\nSince score has become a string and isn't a number anymore we cannot group or sort rules by that. I removed the two components which were responsible for sorting and grouping.\r\n\r\nThis is what I'm talking about:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2019-02-28 at 16 15 16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2196208/53576558-43211f00-3b74-11e9-95e7-a465c833908f.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds syntax highlighting to the `rule` field. The label \"TEXT\" was rewritten to \"RULE\" to make it clear what we're editing.\r\n\r\n**A few things to keep in mind**\r\n\r\n- If you add two or more rules with the exact same `rule` it just simply doesn't add it to the list (it should be more responsive by letting the user know)\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\n1. Go to `/sensors`\r\n2. Click on a sensor's edit button (the pen on the right)\r\n3. Look for the `Threat Triage` section in the right floating pane\r\n3. Click on the Threat Triage section's expander (it's the icon on the right)\r\n4. In the second pane, click on the big `+` button at the bottom\r\n5. In the 3rd panel add a name, a rule and a score (a score can be a Stellar expression like `value * 10`)\r\n6. Click on the `Save` button. It'll validate the expression for you. If it's not, it'll let you know.\r\n7. Check the newly added rule in the rule list in the 2nd pane\r\n9. Take a quick look at the Threat Triage section in the 1st pane if it's ok\r\n8. Don't forget to click on the Save button in the 1st pane\r\n\r\n9. Open the read-only sensor pane (clicking on anywhere else but the pen on the row)\r\n10. Find the Threat Triage section\r\n11. Check if it's ok\r\n\r\n![threat-triage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2196208/53577608-3e5d6a80-3b76-11e9-8f8b-77af3454dbb4.gif)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR removes the check on the response content length header.  From what I can tell, this header is optional in the HTTP/2 specification:  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.6.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested by using the `REST_GET` function with an endpoint that doesn't include the content length header.  Before an empty response was returned:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_GET('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon')\r\n[Stellar]>>> \r\n```\r\nAfter this change it should return a response with json content.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR represents a fairly significant shift in the Writer class architecture.  Currently these classes do not support tuples that result in multiple messages, mainly due to a limitation in the `BulkMessageWriter` interface.  The `write` method accepts separate lists of tuples and messages so there is no way to know which tuples are associated with which message.  It has worked so far with parsers that only emit a single message from a tuple because a 1 to 1 relationship is assumed in these classes.\r\n\r\nI experimented with several different approaches to fixing this and tried to follow a strategy that would avoid having to significantly rewrite multiple classes (this was unavoidable in certain places).  I change the `BulkMessageWriter.write` interface from:\r\n```\r\nBulkWriterResponse write(String sensorType, WriterConfiguration configurations, Iterable<Tuple> tuples, List<MESSAGE_T> messages) throws Exception;\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\nBulkWriterResponse write(String sensorType, WriterConfiguration configurations, Map<String, MESSAGE_T> messages) throws Exception;\r\n```\r\nThe messages being passed in are now represented as a map where the keys are message ids and the values are the messages.  This made changes to the `BulkMessageWriter` implementations easier because they continue to assume a 1 to 1 relationship between message ids (formerly tuples) and messages.  Now the writers report which message ids succeeded/failed instead of tuples.  The `BulkWriterComponent` continues track batch sizes and timeouts but no longer manages tuples or error handling.  Instead it calls `BulkWriterResponseHandler.handleFlush` when messages are flushed.  This interface is injected into `BulkWriterComponent` and allows us to properly commit messages according to the requirements of the platform the classes are running on.  For now a Storm implementation of `BulkWriterResponseHandler` is setup and passed into the `BulkWriterComponent`.   Managing tuple to message relationships as well as tuple acking and error handling are now done in a single class.  The bolts now have to setup a `StormBulkWriterResponseHandler` object and add tuples/messages to it.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- The `BulkMessageWriter` is updated and all implementations have been adjusted to conform to the new interfaces.  Changes to the implementations are small and straightforward.\r\n- Tuple acking and error handling is moved out of `BulkWriterComponent` and into `StormBulkWriterResponseHandler`. \r\n- Bolts have been updated with the new `StormBulkWriterResponseHandler` pattern\r\n- I noticed `HBaseWriter` and `PcapWriter are no longer being used.  Rather than go to the trouble of updating their tests I removed them.\r\n- Removed `WriterHandler.handleAck` since acks are no longer handled here.\r\n- Added logging to make troubleshooting writer issues easier\r\n\r\nThere were also several significant changes that needed to be made to the tests:\r\n\r\n- The writer tests are updated to match the new `BulkMessageWriter.write` interface.  In most cases these changes were simple however I noticed there were no unit tests for `KafkaWriter.write` so I added them.\r\n- The parser integration tests now verify the all tuples were acked.\r\n- There is now a parser integration test that simulates the use case described in this Jira.  The `jsonMapQuery` parser integration test now produces multiple messages from a single tuple and sets the batch size to 5.\r\n- A test was added for `StormBulkWriterResponseHandler` that also simulates the use case described in this Jira.  Error handling tests that were originally in `BulkWriterComponentTest` were migrated here.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev both for regression and for the use case described in this Jira.  There are 3 test cases:\r\n\r\n- bro sensor with a batch size set to 5\r\n- snort sensor with a batch size set to 1\r\n- jsonMapQuery sensor that produces multiple messages from a tuple with a batch size set to both less than and greater than the number of messages \r\n\r\n#### Setup\r\n1. Spin up full dev and verify data is landing in both Elasticsearch and HDFS.   \r\n2. Stop all sensors with `service sensor-stubs stop`.\r\n3. Create the jsonMapQuery sensor topic:\r\n```\r\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --create --topic jsonMapQuery --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1\r\n```\r\n4. Copy the jsonMapQuery sample data to full dev:\r\n```\r\ncd /metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\nvagrant scp ../../../metron-platform/metron-integration-test/src/main/sample/data/jsonMapQuery/raw/jsonMapExampleOutput /tmp\r\n```\r\n5. Stop Metron Parsers in Ambari.\r\n6. Navigate to Ambari > Metron > Configs > Parsers and change \"Metron Parsers\" from `bro,snort,yaf` to `bro,snort,jsonMapQuery`.\r\n7. Start Metron Parsers in Ambari.\r\n8. Clear the Elasticsearch indices:\r\n```\r\ncurl -XDELETE http://node1:9200/bro_index*\r\ncurl -XDELETE http://node1:9200/snort_index*\r\n```\r\n9. Stop Metron Indexing in Ambari. \r\n10. Clear the HDFS files:\r\n```\r\nsu hdfs -c \"hdfs dfs -rm /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/*\"\r\nsu hdfs -c \"hdfs dfs -rm /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/snort/*\"\r\n```\r\n11. Start Metron Indexing in Ambari.\r\n\r\n12. Verify there is no bro or snort data in Elasticsearch or HDFS:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -s -XGET http://node1:9200/_cat/indices?h=index,docs.count | grep bro\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -s -XGET http://node1:9200/_cat/indices?h=index,docs.count | grep snort\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/*.json | wc -l\r\ncat: `/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/*.json': No such file or directory\r\n0\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/snort/*.json | wc -l\r\ncat: `/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/snort/*.json': No such file or directory\r\n0\r\n```\r\n13. Each topology (parsing, enrichment, indexing) can be configured with a batch size and timeout.  The batch timeout defaults to 1/2 the tuple timeout so tests described next should be done reasonably quick (before the timeout happens).  To make the test results easier to understand we also need to adjust the batch sizes to 1 for topologies we are not directly testing.  Set the bro parser batch size to 1:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.bro.BasicBroParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"bro\",\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1\r\n  }\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/config/bro'\r\n```\r\n14. Set the snort parser batch size to 1:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.snort.BasicSnortParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"snort\",\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1\r\n  }\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/config/snort'\r\n```\r\n15. Set the enrichment batch size to 1:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"es.clustername\": \"metron\",\r\n  \"es.ip\": \"node1:9200\",\r\n  \"es.date.format\": \"yyyy.MM.dd.HH\",\r\n  \"parser.error.topic\": \"indexing\",\r\n  \"update.hbase.table\": \"metron_update\",\r\n  \"update.hbase.cf\": \"t\",\r\n  \"es.client.settings\": {},\r\n  \"profiler.client.period.duration\": \"15\",\r\n  \"profiler.client.period.duration.units\": \"MINUTES\",\r\n  \"user.settings.hbase.table\": \"user_settings\",\r\n  \"user.settings.hbase.cf\": \"cf\",\r\n  \"bootstrap.servers\": \"node1:6667\",\r\n  \"source.type.field\": \"source:type\",\r\n  \"threat.triage.score.field\": \"threat:triage:score\",\r\n  \"enrichment.writer.batchSize\": \"1\",\r\n  \"profiler.writer.batchSize\": \"15\",\r\n  \"profiler.writer.batchTimeout\": \"0\",\r\n  \"geo.hdfs.file\": \"/apps/metron/geo/default/GeoLite2-City.tar.gz\",\r\n  \"asn.hdfs.file\": \"/apps/metron/asn/default/GeoLite2-ASN.tar.gz\"\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/global/config'\r\n```\r\n16. Set the jsonMapQuery indexing batch size to 1 (since we will test this sensor in parsers):\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"hdfs\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"jsonmapquery\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n    \"enabled\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"elasticsearch\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"jsonmapquery\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n    \"enabled\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"solr\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"jsonmapquery\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n    \"enabled\": false\r\n  }\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/indexing/config/jsonMapQuery'\r\n```\r\nIt can be helpful to keep a Kafka console consumer running for each topic:\r\n```\r\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --topic bro\r\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --topic snort\r\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --topic jsonMapQuery\r\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --topic enrichments\r\n/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --zookeeper node1:2181 --topic indexing\r\n```\r\n#### bro\r\n1. Bro has a batch size of 5 in indexing by default.  Write 4 bro messages:\r\n```\r\nshuf -n 4 /opt/sensor-stubs/data/bro.out | sed -e \"s/\\\"ts\\\"\\:[0-9]\\+\\./\\\"ts\\\"\\:`date +%s`\\./g\" | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic bro\r\n```\r\nThere should be no data in Elasticsearch or HDFS:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -s -XGET http://node1:9200/_cat/indices?h=index,docs.count | grep bro\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/*.json | wc -l\r\ncat: `/apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/*.json': No such file or directory\r\n0\r\n```\r\n2. Write an additional bro message:\r\n```\r\nshuf -n 1 /opt/sensor-stubs/data/bro.out | sed -e \"s/\\\"ts\\\"\\:[0-9]\\+\\./\\\"ts\\\"\\:`date +%s`\\./g\" | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic bro\r\n```\r\nThere should now be 5 messages in Elasticsearch and HDFS:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -s -XGET http://node1:9200/_cat/indices?h=index,docs.count | grep bro\r\nbro_index_2019.02.07.22    5\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/*.json | wc -l\r\n5\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### snort\r\n1. Snort has a batch size of 1 in indexing by default:  Write a snort message:\r\n```\r\nshuf -n 1 /opt/sensor-stubs/data/snort.out | sed -e \"s/[^,]\\+ ,/`date +'%m\\/%d\\/%y-%H:%M:%S'`.000000 ,/g\" | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic snort\r\n```\r\nThere should now be 1 message in Elasticsearch and HDFS:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -s -XGET http://node1:9200/_cat/indices?h=index,docs.count | grep snort\r\nsnort_index_2019.02.07.22    1\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/snort/*.json | wc -l\r\n1\r\n```\r\n#### jsonMapQuery\r\n1. The jsonMapQuery sensor produces 10 messages for every tuple.  Set the batch size to 5 in the parser topology:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.json.JSONMapParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"jsonMapQuery\",\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n    \"jsonpQuery\": \"$.foo\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 5\r\n  }\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/config/jsonMapQuery'\r\n```\r\n2. Writer a jsonMapQuery message:\r\n```\r\ncat /tmp/jsonMapExampleOutput | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic jsonMapQuery\r\n```\r\nThis should cause the issue described in the Jira.  Before there was only a single message being written for each tuple.  With this PR there should be 10 messages in Elasticsearch and HDFS:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -s -XGET http://node1:9200/_cat/indices?h=index,docs.count | grep jsonmapquery\r\njsonmapquery_index_2019.02.07.22   10\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/jsonMapQuery/*.json | wc -l\r\n10\r\n```\r\n3. Change the batch size to 15:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.json.JSONMapParser\",\r\n  \"sensorTopic\": \"jsonMapQuery\",\r\n  \"parserConfig\": {\r\n    \"jsonpQuery\": \"$.foo\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 15\r\n  }\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/config/jsonMapQuery'\r\n```\r\n4. Writer another jsonMapQuery message:\r\n```\r\ncat /tmp/jsonMapExampleOutput | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic jsonMapQuery\r\n```\r\nThere should still be 10 messages in Elasticsearch and HDFS (no additional messages written):\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -s -XGET http://node1:9200/_cat/indices?h=index,docs.count | grep jsonmapquery\r\njsonmapquery_index_2019.02.07.22   10\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/jsonMapQuery/*.json | wc -l\r\n10\r\n```\r\n5. Writer another jsonMapQuery message:\r\n```\r\ncat /tmp/jsonMapExampleOutput | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic jsonMapQuery\r\n```\r\nThis should cause a batch to flush so we should see 15 additional messages:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -s -XGET http://node1:9200/_cat/indices?h=index,docs.count | grep jsonmapquery\r\njsonmapquery_index_2019.02.07.22   25\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/jsonMapQuery/*.json | wc -l\r\n25\r\n```\r\n6. Writer another jsonMapQuery message:\r\n```\r\ncat /tmp/jsonMapExampleOutput | /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list node1:6667 --topic jsonMapQuery\r\n```\r\nThis should cause another batch to flush since there were 5 messages still in the batch.  We should see another 15 messages added:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -s -XGET http://node1:9200/_cat/indices?h=index,docs.count | grep jsonmapquery\r\njsonmapquery_index_2019.02.07.22   40\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# hdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/jsonMapQuery/*.json | wc -l\r\n40\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe various topologies can be tested by adjusting their batch sizes and timeouts.  The previous instructions focus on testing batch sizes for bro in indexing, snort in indexing and jsonMapQuery in parsing.  Other topologies and scenarios can and should be tested with different batch sizes and timeouts.\r\n\r\n### Feedback Requested\r\n\r\nOutside of the standard code review and function testing, they are a few areas that are not 100% clear and I would like feedback on:\r\n\r\n- Is the fundamental architectural approach solid?  Are there any holes I'm not thinking of?\r\n- The message ids generated by the bolts and used to track messages in the writer classes are Java UUIDs.  Is this good enough?  Any id that uniquely identifies a message could be used here.  Is there something that would perform better? \r\n- There is the potential for messages to pile up in `StormBulkWriterResponseHandler` (and probably other `BulkWriterComponent` too) when tuples time out and are replayed.  I think this is also an issue now but should we explore some kind of cache that can evict messages after timeouts?\r\n- I have added javadocs and am planning on taking another pass and adding more.  Are there areas you feel need more/better explanation?  My goal is for these classes to be easy to understand and navigate.  Is the interaction between the bolts and response handler clear?\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nCurrently the tooltip for the ES mpack path_data is incorrect.  It says:\r\n'Comma-separated list of directories where to store index data allocated for each node: \"/mnt/first\",\"/mnt/second\".'\r\nThis is incorrect, as the way the elasticsearch.yml gets updated results in invalid yaml.  Specifically:\r\n```\r\npath:\r\n  data: \"/mnt/first\",\"/mnt/second\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nTwo valid yaml options are either of the following (I'm excluding any multiline solutions here):\r\n```\r\npath:\r\n  data:\"/mnt/first\",\"/mnt/second\"\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\npath:\r\n  data: [ \"/mnt/first\", \"/mnt/second\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can either remove the space after `data:` or use the [ ] notation.  Since we use the [ ] notation elsewhere, I suggest we move in that direction with the tooltip.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTested on a physical deployment of 0.7.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Batch Profiler does not seem to see the STATS_* functions. When I attempt to run a profile using any of those functions, it fails. It is able to 'see' a limited subset of functions, but not all those that I would expect.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nThe ClassIndex library is used to create an index of all Stellar functions at compile-time. This index is packaged in the JAR as `META-INF/annotations/org.apache.metron.stellar.dsl.Stellar`.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a shaded jar using the Maven Shade Plugin, the index files created by ClassIndex are overwritten by default. ClassIndex provides a special transformer for Maven which merges the index files instead of overwriting them.\r\n\r\nWithout using this transformer, the index files are overwritten and Stellar function resolution will not work. This is why Stellar function resolution is not working.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atteo/classindex#making-shaded-jar\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up this profile in the Batch Profiler.  It should write successfully to HBase.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"profiles\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"profile\": \"profile-using-stats\",\r\n      \"foreach\": \"ip_src_addr\",\r\n      \"update\": { \"s\": \"STATS_ADD(s, length)\" },\r\n      \"result\": \"STATS_SUM(s)\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"timestampField\":\"timestamp\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Install Spark2 on a development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Do **not** configure connectivity between Spark and HBase.  \r\n\r\n    More specifically on HDP, you need to run the following command to allow Spark to connect to HBase.   Do not do this, so that you can see the error message.\r\n    ```\r\n    cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml /etc/spark2/conf/\r\n    ```\r\n1. Create a simple 'Hello, World' profile and run it according to the instructions in the Batch Profiler README.\r\n\r\n1. When running `bin/start_batch_profiler.sh`, ensure that the error message indicates that the problem is due to HBase connectivity.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

user can choose to add metadata to each parsed message using the `readMetadata` parser option.  The error messages that are generated when a parser error occurs, do not include this metadata. This means that the metadata is lost when an error occurs. The metadata should be persisted with the error message.\r\n\r\nFor example, with this change the metadata field containing the Kafka topic will be included in the error message as a field named `metron.metadata.topic`.\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"exception\": \"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to parse Message: \\\"this is an invalid synthetic message\\\" }\",\r\n  \"stack\": \"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to parse Message: ..\",\r\n  \"raw_message\": \"\\\"this is an invalid synthetic message\\\" }\",\r\n  \"error_hash\": \"3d498968e8df7f28d05db3037d4ad2a3a0095c22c14d881be45fac3f184dbcc3\",\r\n  \"message\": \"Unable to parse Message: \\\"this is an invalid synthetic message\\\" }\",\r\n  \"source.type\": \"error\",\r\n  \"failed_sensor_type\": \"bro\",\r\n  \"hostname\": \"node1\",\r\n  \"error_type\": \"parser_error\",\r\n  \"guid\": \"563d8d2a-1493-4758-be2f-5613bfd2d615\",\r\n  \"timestamp\": 1548366516634,\r\n  \"metron.metadata.topic\": \"bro\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. In Ambari, change the parser error topic to `parser_errors`.  Then restart the parsers.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Stellar REPL.\r\n\r\n1. Capture metadata for Bro by setting the value of `readMetadata` to true.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := CONFIG_GET(\"PARSER\",\"bro\")\r\n    {\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n    {\r\n      ...\r\n      \"readMetadata\" : true,\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>>\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PARSER\", conf, \"bro\")\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Push a message into the `bro` topic which will fail to parser.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n    \"this is an invalid synthetic message\" }\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"bro\", msg)\r\n    1\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Wait for a bit until the message is processed.  When it has been processed, pull the error message off of the error topic.  The error message should contain a field `metron.metadata.topic`.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_GET(\"parser_errors\")\r\n    [{\r\n      \"exception\": \"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to parse Message: \\\"this is an invalid synthetic message\\\" }\",\r\n      \"stack\": \"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to parse Message: \\\"this is an invalid synthetic message\\\" }\\n\\tat org.apache.metron.parsers.bro.BasicBroParser.parse(BasicBroParser.java:145)\\n\\tat org.apache.metron.parsers.interfaces.MessageParser.parseOptional(MessageParser.java:54)\\n\\tat org.apache.metron.parsers.interfaces.MessageParser.parseOptionalResult(MessageParser.java:67)\\n\\tat org.apache.metron.parsers.ParserRunnerImpl.execute(ParserRunnerImpl.java:144)\\n\\tat org.apache.metron.parsers.bolt.ParserBolt.execute(ParserBolt.java:252)\\n\\tat org.apache.storm.daemon.executor$fn__10252$tuple_action_fn__10254.invoke(executor.clj:735)\\n\\tat org.apache.storm.daemon.executor$mk_task_receiver$fn__10171.invoke(executor.clj:466)\\n\\tat org.apache.storm.disruptor$clojure_handler$reify__9685.onEvent(disruptor.clj:40)\\n\\tat org.apache.storm.utils.DisruptorQueue.consumeBatchToCursor(DisruptorQueue.java:472)\\n\\tat org.apache.storm.utils.DisruptorQueue.consumeBatchWhenAvailable(DisruptorQueue.java:451)\\n\\tat org.apache.storm.disruptor$consume_batch_when_available.invoke(disruptor.clj:73)\\n\\tat org.apache.storm.daemon.executor$fn__10252$fn__10265$fn__10320.invoke(executor.clj:855)\\n\\tat org.apache.storm.util$async_loop$fn__553.invoke(util.clj:484)\\n\\tat clojure.lang.AFn.run(AFn.java:22)\\n\\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\\nCaused by: Unexpected token RIGHT BRACE(}) at position 39.\\n\\tat org.json.simple.parser.JSONParser.parse(JSONParser.java:146)\\n\\tat org.json.simple.parser.JSONParser.parse(JSONParser.java:81)\\n\\tat org.json.simple.parser.JSONParser.parse(JSONParser.java:75)\\n\\tat org.apache.metron.parsers.bro.JSONCleaner.clean(JSONCleaner.java:49)\\n\\tat org.apache.metron.parsers.bro.BasicBroParser.parse(BasicBroParser.java:68)\\n\\t... 14 more\\n\",\r\n      \"raw_message\": \"\\\"this is an invalid synthetic message\\\" }\",\r\n      \"error_hash\": \"3d498968e8df7f28d05db3037d4ad2a3a0095c22c14d881be45fac3f184dbcc3\",\r\n      \"message\": \"Unable to parse Message: \\\"this is an invalid synthetic message\\\" }\",\r\n      \"source.type\": \"error\",\r\n      \"failed_sensor_type\": \"bro\",\r\n      \"hostname\": \"node1\",\r\n      \"error_type\": \"parser_error\",\r\n      \"guid\": \"563d8d2a-1493-4758-be2f-5613bfd2d615\",\r\n      \"timestamp\": 1548366516634,\r\n      \"metron.metadata.topic\": \"bro\"\r\n    }]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to original Jira ticket: https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1971\r\n\r\nWe currently use the default timeout in Cypress, which is only 4000ms. I believe this short timeout can cause failures like this in Metron: https://travis-ci.org/apache/metron/jobs/483945575\r\n\r\nIn this Pull Request, I increased Cypress' default timeout and request timeout settings (the request timeout was only 5000ms). \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n* With the current version of master, open a terminal window and navigate to `metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts`\r\n* Generate an Angular build by running `npm run build`.\r\n* Start a production-configured angular server by running `npm run start:ci`.\r\n* Start the Cypress UI by running `npm run cypress:open`.\r\n* Start the tests by clicking on the PCAP test suite in the Cypress UI.\r\n* Open the network tab and throttle network speeds to 'Slow 3G'.\r\n* Re-run the tests by clicking on the reload page button. Your tests should fail.\r\n\r\nTo confirm the changes work, clone this repo and run the steps above. The tests should pass despite the slow time to render.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a bug that was exposed when using the REGEX_SELECT to set a Kafka topic field value (route a message).  When a REGEX_SELECT doesn't match the Kafka topic field is not set.  The KafkaWriter drops the message in this case but does not return the corresponding Tuple as a success or failure.  As a result the Tuple is never acked.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that bug by adding logic to the BulkWriterComponent to ack any tuples that are not returned by a writer in the BulkWriterResponse.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- Added logic to ack missing tuples to the BulkWriterComponent\r\n- Added the `handleCommit` flag to the BulkWriterComponent error handling.  I believe this is a minor bug and error handling should respect that flag.\r\n- Refactored the parser integration tests slightly to use a BulkMessageWriter instead of a MessageWriter.  The fact that a MessageWriter is used made it harder to track this bug down.  This is an incremental improvement and can be expanded later if we want to simulate batches in our parser integration tests.  For now the batch size is set to 1 to avoid having to update the test cases or test data.\r\n- Added a unit test to catch this issue in the future\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI have tested this with modified integration tests but I think it would be good for someone other than me to test in full dev.  To recreate the test:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and ensure parser topologies are running\r\n2. Create a new parser config and define a Kafka topic field:\r\n```\r\n\"parserConfig\": {\r\n        ...\r\n        \"kafka.topicField\": \"kafka_topic_field\"\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n3.  Create a field transformation to set this field using a `REGEX_SELECT` transformation:\r\n```\r\n\"fieldTransformations\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"input\": [\r\n                \"message\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"output\": [\r\n                \"kafka_topic_field\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"transformation\": \"REGEX_SELECT\",\r\n            \"config\": {\r\n                \"new_topic\": \"regex value\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n4. Send some messages that the `REGEX_SELECT` will match and send some that won't.\r\n5. All tuples should be acked and there should be no errors in Storm\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a few bugs that are exposed when a Knox Gateway is not installed on the same host as Metron.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- The Metron Knox installed flag is now only written when Metron Knox is actually installed.  Before it was being written when a Metron Client is installed, Metron Knox is enabled and Knox is not been present on that host yet. \r\n- The Metron Client component now installs the various Metron scripts and binaries.\r\n- The Knox host is now added to the Metron SSO whitelist.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis can be tested in full dev by just verifying Knox with Metron still works.  It should also be tested in a multi-node environment where Knox and Metron are not colocated.\r\n\r\n### Other Considerations\r\n\r\nI can't think of any reason we would not want the Metron Client component to install the various Metron packages but let me know if anyone disagrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to the original ASF JIRA ticket: https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1958\r\n\r\nAs described in the ticket, we have a few anti-patterns in place right now in regard to our Cypress configuration. Through local testing, I believe this has led to the recent Travis failures in Pull Requests like #1308 and #1275. \r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n* Update npm scripts to use the express server that's already in place vs. the angular cli development server. Lately, we have been running into a race condition where sometimes the Cypress tests are running before the application has been compiled and the server has started. We should be testing the built application after the build is complete.\r\n* Add a baseUrl property to the Cypress config [per their recommendation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Setting-a-global-baseUrl).\r\n* Remove the logout click action in the afterEach hook [per the Cypress team's recommendation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Using-after-or-afterEach-hooks). While we had to do this to clean up state when the tests were run in protractor, it's unnecessary in Cypress and can cause errors if a test is reloaded before the afterEach executes or loaded before the page reload is complete.\r\n* Add yamljs as a dependency in the alerts ui. This dependency is already part of the project in the config ui and was already used by the express server to parse the configuration file.\r\n* Update the Cypress tests to use the updated global configuration endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nClone either #1308 and #1275 locally. From the command line, navigate to metron-interface/metron-alerts from the root of the project. Install npm dependencies by running `npm ci`. Then, run `npm run cypress:ci`. #1308 will always fail, and #1275 will intermittently fail.\r\n\r\nOnce you've verified failure on either on of the PRs mentioned above, clone this PR locally. Merge it into #1308 or #1275, run `npm ci`, then run `npm run cypress:ci`. The tests should consistently pass now.\r\n\r\n### Other Considerations\r\nThe Cypress team recommends the use of the `wait-on` or `start-server-and-test` modules to handle the flow of starting your server, starting Cypress and, once the tests complete, killing your server. However, since the next proposed Metron release is near and this PR will fix failing PRs needed for that release, I decided instead to continue using the npm-run-all module we were already using. Since the express server is so incredibly fast compared to the startup of Cypress, I felt the risk of a race condition happening would be extremely low and this was the best approach for now. I've created a ticket around the addition of the recommended modules to keep track of the task: https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1959\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel).\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && dev-utilities/build-utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [x] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book? If not then run the following commands and the verify changes via `site-book/target/site/index.html`:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd site-book\r\n  mvn site\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\nIt is also recommended that [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) is set up for your personal repository such that your branches are built there before submitting a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-28T13:12:36Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T16:20:05Z","closed_at":"2019-01-03T15:46:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1853ad7a6ad9967a000ae815bc48e7288ce822c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/1317/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/1317/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1317/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/1aec768853f966475f4c60f38adbc92cc02fe93e","head":{"label":"sardell:METRON-1958","ref":"METRON-1958","sha":"1aec768853f966475f4c60f38adbc92cc02fe93e","user":{"login":"sardell","id":7304869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell","html_url":"https://github.com/sardell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130194002,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzAxOTQwMDI=","name":"metron","full_name":"sardell/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sardell","id":7304869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell","html_url":"https://github.com/sardell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sardell/metron","description":"Mirror

a threat triage rule's score to be expressed as either a numeric value or a Stellar expression.  \r\n\r\n* The change is backwards compatible.  Users will not have to alter their existing triage rules.\r\n\r\n* The 'score' expression has access to all of the fields contained within the message being triaged.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Create a threat triage engine.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> t := THREAT_TRIAGE_INIT()\r\n    [Stellar]>>> t\r\n    ThreatTriage{0 rule(s)}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Add a triage rule that uses a simple numeric score.  This is the existing behavior that continues to be supported.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> THREAT_TRIAGE_ADD(t, {\"name\":\"rule1\", \"rule\":\"value>10\", \"score\":10})\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Add another triage rule that uses a score expression.  This will simply make the score 10 times the value contained in the message.\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> THREAT_TRIAGE_ADD(t, {\"name\":\"rule2\", \"rule\":\"value>20\", \"score\":\"value*10\"})\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Review the rules that you have created.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> THREAT_TRIAGE_PRINT(t)\r\n    ╔═══════╤═════════╤═════════════╤══════════╤════════╗\r\n    ║ Name  │ Comment │ Triage Rule │ Score    │ Reason ║\r\n    ╠═══════╪═════════╪═════════════╪══════════╪════════╣\r\n    ║ rule1 │         │ value>10    │ 10       │        ║\r\n    ╟───────┼─────────┼─────────────┼──────────┼────────╢\r\n    ║ rule2 │         │ value>20    │ value*10 │        ║\r\n    ╚═══════╧═════════╧═════════════╧══════════╧════════╝\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a few test messages to simulate your telemetry.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg1 := \"{ \\\"value\\\":22 }\"\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg1\r\n    { \"value\":22 }\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg2 := \"{ \\\"value\\\":44 }\"\r\n    [Stellar]>>> msg2\r\n    { \"value\":44 }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Score a message based on the rules that have been defined.  The result allows you to see the total score, the aggregator, along with details about each rule that fired.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> THREAT_TRIAGE_SCORE( msg1, t)\r\n    {score=220.0, aggregator=MAX, rules=[{score=10, name=rule1, rule=value>10}, {score=value*10, name=rule2, rule=value>20}]}\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> THREAT_TRIAGE_SCORE( msg2, t)\r\n    {score=440.0, aggregator=MAX, rules=[{score=10, name=rule1, rule=value>10}, {score=value*10, name=rule2, rule=value>20}]}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1951\r\n\r\nThis adds site-book generation to Travis. Based on METRON-1950, the Travis build should pass. There's nothing to validate locally, this is a modification to our Travis build. You should see an extra step that validates that the site-book generates/builds successfully without error. This takes all of 40s and should have negligible impact to our overall build time.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1950\r\n\r\nThis is currently breaking the ability the run `mvn clean site` in the site-book module. The reason for  this issue is that we recently had a PR make it in that likely looked good via Github markdown, but didn't end up getting tested via Doxia using our site-book build. The errors end up being really esoteric, e.g. it will complain about opening/closing tags. In reality, this stemmed from a few nested problems. First, indentation around some code samples (triple backticks) within bullet lists was incorrect. This cause the open/close tag error. Even if you fix that, the html page will render horribly. You can try all the nested indexing for 2nd level bullet list code examples you want, but it will never work until you correct the full chain. The Doxia plugin is extremely opinionated about having 4 spaces for nesting indented bullet list along with any other comments or code examples that should be indented at the same level. Items that should end up at the same indention level as a bullet point actually need another 4 spaces of indentation. You can see examples in the README's in this PR. A sample follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Test1\r\n    * Test1a\r\n        \r\n        I'm a comment within Test1a\r\n\r\n        ```\r\n        { \r\n          \"foo\" : \"bar\",\r\n          \"this\" : \"is a code example with json\"\r\n        }\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n    I'm at the same level as Test1a, a non-bullet item under Test1\r\n* Test2\r\n    * Test2a\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would render as follows:\r\n* Test1\r\n    * Test1a\r\n\r\n        I'm a comment within Test1a\r\n\r\n        ```\r\n        { \r\n          \"foo\" : \"bar\",\r\n          \"this\" : \"is a code example with json\"\r\n        }\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n    I'm at the same level as Test1a, a non-bullet item under Test1\r\n* Test2\r\n    * Test2a\r\n\r\nI generally add 1 extra blank line above and below the indented code snippets for better spacing, but I believe that's optional and shouldn't affect the overall document formatting, unlike the indentation.\r\n\r\nI also fixed a couple broken images in the parsers README and use-cases README for parser-chaining. The upshot to this part of the fix is that you need to make sure you update the rewriting rules to include the original image path, and then rewrite and project-relative links accordingly in each markdown page using the relative path to \"images\", which is where the site-book copies them all.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nRun the site-book documentation validation steps in our PR checklist from below.\r\n* Check formatting and images on the main parser page - metron-platform/metron-parsing/index.html\r\n* Check broken images on metron-platform/metron-parsing/metron-parsers-common/ParserChaining.html\r\n* Check I didn't break any images in use-cases/parser_chaining/index.html\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR is based on https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275 and adds Ambari MPack support for enabling Metron on Knox.  This makes the setup process simpler, consisting of only a couple steps.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- Added code to the Ambari METRON_CLIENT component that performs the necessary setup/installation for Metron on Knox\r\n- Added `metron.knox.enabled` and `metron.knox.sso.pubkey` properties to Ambari\r\n- Added Metron Knox topology files as templates in Ambari so the correct hosts can be configured automatically\r\n- Added `app-config.json` files as templates in Ambari so the correct paths can be configured automatically\r\n- Added a check for LDAP, throwing an error message if it is not enabled\r\n- Added logic to populate the Spring active profiles and options on REST startup\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  The setup steps are similar to https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275 but should be substantially simpler with less manual work involved:\r\n\r\n1. Add Knox as a Service in Ambari (Admin > Stacks and Versions > Add Service next to Knox)\r\n2. Verify the LDAP check is working.  Navigate to `Ambari > Metron > Configs > Security` and set `Knox Enabled` to true.  Restart the Metron REST component and it should fail with this error:\r\n```\r\nEnabling Metron with Knox requires LDAP authentication.  Please set `LDAP Enabled` to true in the Metron Security tab.\r\n```\r\nChange `Knox Enabled` back to false and save.\r\n\r\n3. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-deployment/development#knox-demo-ldap) to enable the Knox LDAP in full dev.  You should be able to authentication with REST using guest/guest-password after this is done.\r\n4. A Metron Client instance is required on all Knox Gateway hosts.  Navigate to `Ambari > Hosts > node1` and select the `Install clients` option in the dropdown next to the clients, at the bottom of the `Components` section.  This should install the Metron Client.\r\n5. Get the Knox public key with the following command on full dev:\r\n```\r\nopenssl s_client -connect node1:8443 < /dev/null | openssl x509 | grep -v 'CERTIFICATE' | paste -sd \"\" -\r\n```\r\nCopy the output of that command and paste to the Ambari setting at `Metron > Configs > Security > Knox SSO Public Key`.  Change the `Knox Enabled` setting right above that to true and save.\r\n\r\n6. You should be prompted to restart Metron Client, Metron REST, Metron Alerts UI and Metron Management UI.  Follow the prompt and restart these components.\r\n\r\nAfter REST comes back up Metron should be enabled for Knox.  You should be able to follow the instructions in the https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275 description for verifying that SSO is working for all services.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1944\r\n\r\n**The problem**\r\n\r\nThe problem and its solution are quite trivial in this case. The code which is responsible for the deletion of the comment tried to address the deleted comment in an array after it was removed from it.\r\n\r\n`splice` returns with an array of the removed elements so we can keep working with that to persist the operation for the given comment on the server.\r\n\r\n**Description from the ASF Jira ticket:**\r\n\r\nI am unable to delete a comment in the Alerts UI. While it appears that the comment is deleted, it is only deleted locally, but not server side. An exception is thrown in the browser console.\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'alertComment' of undefined at SafeSubscriber._next (alert-details.component.ts:258) at SafeSubscriber.push../node_modules/rxjs/_esm5/internal/Subscriber.js.SafeSubscriber.__tryOrUnsub (Subscriber.js:207) at SafeSubscriber.push../node_modules/rxjs/_esm5/internal/Subscriber.js.SafeSubscriber.next (Subscriber.js:145) at Subscriber.push../node_modules/rxjs/_esm5/internal/Subscriber.js.Subscriber._next (Subscriber.js:80) at Subscriber.push../node_modules/rxjs/_esm5/internal/Subscriber.js.Subscriber.next (Subscriber.js:55) at Subject.push../node_modules/rxjs/_esm5/internal/Subject.js.Subject.next (Subject.js:47) at DialogService.push../src/app/service/dialog.service.ts.DialogService.approve (dialog.service.ts:49) at MetronDialogComponent.push../src/app/shared/metron-dialog/metron-dialog.component.ts.MetronDialogComponent.confirm (metron-dialog.component.ts:54) at Object.handleEvent (login-guard.ts:40) at handleEvent (core.js:10258)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Steps To Replicate**\r\n\r\n1. Find an Alert\r\n2. Comment on the alert.\r\n3. Delete the comment.  \r\n4. Close the side panel.\r\n5. Search for the alert again.\r\n6. Click on the alert and the comment remains.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1941\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n\r\nThe escalation works as long as you initiate it in the alert details sidebar by clicking on the \"Escalate\" button. \r\nBut if you select multiple alerts in the list component and choose \"escalate\" from the top-right sidebar, it only sends a patch request to the server but calling the escalation endpoint is missing.\r\n\r\n**Description from the Jira ticket:**\r\n\r\nIf I escalate an alert by opening the alert in the side panel, then clicking \"ESCALATE\" on the status \"cross\", the UI issues a patch, following by an escalate request. This seems correct.\r\n\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2196208/50159280-a0783480-02d6-11e9-9723-c31c76759c45.png)\r\n\r\nIf I escalate an alert by selecting one or more alerts in the table, then click on ACTIONs > Escalate, only a patch request is submitted. There does not seem to be a call to escalate.\r\n\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2196208/50159289-a5d57f00-02d6-11e9-8809-37ab40317e21.png)\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\nIn order to test it whether it works, please, go to the alert list screen, select one or more alerts with the checkbox on the right, then open the drop-down on the top right and choose \"Escalate\". \r\nIn the Network tab, you should see request targeting the escalation endpoint on the server with the list of the selected alerts.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIf the 'Random Access Search Engine' is misconfigured and reconfigured the indexing server requires a restart, We should check and install the required custom mappings like

Contributor Comments\r\nDouble quotes that are used inside the parser list component are causing a parsing issue for Cypress, even if you switch them out with html encoded double quotes.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nYou can reliably test against PR https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1275\r\n\r\nClone the base branch from that PR and run `npm run cypress:ci`. You will see all the tests fail.\r\n\r\nClone this PR branch, merge into 1275's base branch and again run `npm run cypress:ci`. This time the tests will pass.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see the cryptic error message, you can also run `ng serve --aot` and then `npx cypress open` and run cypress' tests from its UI. There, you can see the error message in the Cypress tools console.\r\n\r\n## Future considerations\r\nI didn't see any explanations for this issue in my research, but Cypress is now out of beta, so perhaps this issue has been silently addressed. It's worth looking into as a separate task, but this is a very quick, minimally invasive fix for now.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel).\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && dev-utilities/build-utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book? If not then run the following commands and the verify changes via `site-book/target/site/index.html`:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd site-book\r\n  mvn site\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\nIt is also recommended that [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) is set up for your personal repository such that your branches are built there before submitting a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-14T17:01:44Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T14:34:43Z","closed_at":"2018-12-19T14:34:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea6ffd3e656bd07d2bad1820515302fea0ba4a94","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/1301/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/1301/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/issues/1301/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/metron/statuses/0095b8c7f9cbebf22901e7537c844f21af026bc3","head":{"label":"sardell:METRON-1936","ref":"METRON-1936","sha":"0095b8c7f9cbebf22901e7537c844f21af026bc3","user":{"login":"sardell","id":7304869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell","html_url":"https://github.com/sardell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130194002,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzAxOTQwMDI=","name":"metron","full_name":"sardell/metron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sardell","id":7304869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell","html_url":"https://github.com/sardell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sardell/metron","description":"Mirror

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a Stellar function for getting Autonymous System Number info given an IP address.\r\n\r\nIt also refactors the existing Geo database stuff in order to reuse a good amount of that.  The geo_enrichment_load.sh is also updated to handle both files.  A couple points for discussion here\r\n\r\n- Do we want to rename this file and tell users they'll have to use the new version? I don't know how widely used it is.\r\n- Existing users would not be pulling the ASN database, and for offline installs the script would currently require the ASN database.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to update the Upgrading.md and just telling users to load the ASN database into HDFS, and update any scripts using geo_enrichment_load.sh to use the new thing, along with updating offline installs to also provide the ASN database.  New, online installs will pull down both DBs and load them (e.g. full dev).\r\n\r\nWhile implementing this I also discovered that the location of the MaxMind DB online was changed (including the format itself from .gz to tar.gz).  Given that their ASN db needed this, I set things up to support .tar.gz, .gz, and just the bare mmdb file.  There's one question that arises out of this.\r\n- Do we update the Geo DB default URL to point to the updated DB?  I'm strongly inclined to do so, but held off pending this PR being discussed.  Users should just have to update to the latest from the MaxMind site if this is changed.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested from Stellar in general, or by spinning up full dev and ensuring both Geo and ASN work and that the newer files are in /apps/metron<geo/asn>/default\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis upgrades ES and Kibana from 5.6.2 to 5.6.14, specifically with the goal to fix [this](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/27069) which was backported to 5.6.4.  Thanks to the great work in #1242 this was a piece of cake.  I spun it up and poked around in ES, Kibana, the Alerts UI, and did some digging through logs looking for errors or warnings.  Found some things that can be improved for the future, but don't appear to have been introduced by this PR.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nSpin up full-dev, ensure ES/Kibana is healthy/working as expected, and is version 5.6.14.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen viewing profile measurements in the REPL using PROFILE_GET, you simply get back a list of values. It is not easy to determine from which time period the measurements were taken.\r\n\r\nFor example, are the following values all sequential?  Are there any gaps in the measurements taken over the past 30 minutes?  When was the first measurement taken?\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"global\",PROFILE_FIXED(30, \"MINUTES\"))\r\n[2655, 1170, 1185, 1170, 1185, 1215, 1200, 1170]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `PROFILE_GET` function was designed to return values that serve as input to other functions.  It was not designed to return values in a human-readable form that can be easily understood. We need another way to query for profile measurements in the REPL that provides a user with a better understanding of the profile measurements.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a new function called `PROFILE_DEBUG`.  It is effectively a \"verbose mode\" for `PROFILE_GET`.  \r\n\r\nFor lack of a better name, I just called it `PROFILE_DEBUG`.  I would be open to alternatives.  I did not want to add additional options to the already complex `PROFILE_GET`.\r\n\r\n* Description: Retrieves a series of measurements from a stored profile. Provides a more verbose view of each measurement than PROFILE_GET. Returns a map containing the profile name, entity, period id, period start, period end for each profile measurement.\r\n\r\n* Arguments:\r\n        profile - The name of the profile.\r\n\tentity - The name of the entity.\r\n\tperiods - The list of profile periods to fetch. Use PROFILE_WINDOW or PROFILE_FIXED.\r\n\tgroups - Optional, The groups to retrieve. Must correspond to the 'groupBy' list used during profile creation. Defaults to an empty list, meaning no groups.\r\n\r\n* Returns: A map for each profile measurement containing the profile name, entity, period, and value.\r\n\r\n## Test Drive\r\n\r\n1. Spin-up Full Dev and create a profile.  Follow the Profiler README.  Reduce the profile period if you are impatient.\r\n\r\n1. Open up the REPL and retrieve the values using `PROFILE_GET`.  Notice that I have no idea when the first measurement was taken, if the values are sequential, if there are gaps in the values and how big.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"global\",PROFILE_FIXED(30, \"MINUTES\"))\r\n    [1185, 1170, 1185, 1215, 1200, 1170, 5425, 1155, 1215, 1200]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Now use `PROFILE_DEBUG` to retrieve the same results.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> results := PROFILE_DEBUG(\"hello-world\",\"global\",PROFILE_FIXED(30, \"MINUTES\"))\r\n    [{period.start=1544119560000, period=12867663, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544119680000, groups=[], value=1185, entity=global}, {period.start=1544119680000, period=12867664, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544119800000, groups=[], value=1170, entity=global}, {period.start=1544119800000, period=12867665, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544119920000, groups=[], value=1185, entity=global}, {period.start=1544119920000, period=12867666, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544120040000, groups=[], value=1215, entity=global}, {period.start=1544120040000, period=12867667, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544120160000, groups=[], value=1200, entity=global}, {period.start=1544120160000, period=12867668, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544120280000, groups=[], value=1170, entity=global}, {period.start=1544120880000, period=12867674, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544121000000, groups=[], value=5425, entity=global}, {period.start=1544121000000, period=12867675, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544121120000, groups=[], value=1155, entity=global}, {period.start=1544121120000, period=12867676, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544121240000, groups=[], value=1215, entity=global}, {period.start=1544121240000, period=12867677, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544121360000, groups=[], value=1200, entity=global}]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. For each measurement, I have a map containing the period, period start, period end, profile name, entity, groups, and value.  With this I can better answer some of the questions above.\r\n    ```\r\n    { \r\n      profile=hello-world, \r\n      entity=global,\r\n      period=12867663,  \r\n      period.start=1544119560000, \r\n      period.end=1544119680000, \r\n      groups=[], \r\n      value=1185\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. When was the first measurement taken?\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> GET(results, 0)\r\n    {period.start=1544119560000, period=12867663, profile=hello-world, period.end=1544119680000, groups=[], value=1185, entity=global}\r\n    ```\r\n    I can see that the first period started at 1544119560000 or Thu Dec 06 2018 18:06:00 UTC.\r\n\r\n1. Are these measurements sequential?  Are there any gaps?\r\n\r\n    I can use `MAP` on the list of results to extract just the periods from each profile measurement. The period is a monotonically increasing value. \r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> MAP(results, m -> MAP_GET(\"period\", m))\r\n    [12867663, 12867664, 12867665, 12867666, 12867667, 12867668, 12867674, 12867675, 12867676, 12867677]\r\n    ```\r\n    From this I can tell that there is a gap in the measurements.  \r\n    * The first period here is 12867663 and the last is 12867677. \r\n    * I can see that the first 6 measurements are sequential up to period 12867668.  \r\n    * Then there is a gap of 5 periods (12867669 - 12867673) before the measurements resume at period 12867674.\r\n\r\n1. How big was that gap?\r\n\r\n    We know that we missed 5 periods, but how big is that gap?\r\n\r\n    Here is when each period starts in epoch milliseconds.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> MAP(results, m -> MAP_GET(\"period.start\", m))\r\n    [1544119560000, 1544119680000, 1544119800000, 1544119920000, 1544120040000, 1544120160000, 1544120880000, 1544121000000, 1544121120000, 1544121240000]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    I can find the difference between the 5th and 6th period.  The different is about 720000 milliseconds, which is 12 minutes.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> MAP_GET(\"period.start\", GET(results, 5))\r\n    1544120160000\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> MAP_GET(\"period.start\", GET(results, 6))\r\n    1544120880000\r\n\r\n    [Stellar]>>> MAP_GET(\"period.start\", GET(results, 6)) - MAP_GET(\"period.start\", GET(results, 5))\r\n    720000\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Altered the ProfilerClient so that it returns the `ProfileMeasurement` values instead of just a list of the raw values stored in HBase. \r\n\r\n* Removed one of the methods of ProfileClient that was not being used to simplify things.\r\n\r\n* Updated `PROFILE_GET` to work with the altered ProfilerClient.\r\n\r\n* Added `PROFILE_DEBUG`.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nSPLIT('foo\\\\\\\\bar', '\\\\\\\\') doesn't work properly. It does after bumping the aesh version.  Seems like something got fixed with the way escaping was handled.\r\n\r\nThe unit test included should *theoretically* exercise this functionality, but the unit tests directly set the buffer and bypass Console's processing of things. We can either leave it, or I can work on getting a properly hooked up unit test to handle this.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR hopefully resolves some of the more frequent, intermittent `ProfilerIntegrationTest` failures.  \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nRun the integration tests and they should not fail.\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly run the integration tests on my laptop and have yet to see a failure.  I am also repeatedly triggering Travis CI builds on this branch to see if any failures occur there.  If I do the same with master, I can replicate the test failures.  I can't prove the problem is solved, but I am hoping this helps.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* This change uses Caffeine's CacheWriter in place of the RemovalListener for profile expiration.  This is explained more in the next section.\r\n\r\n* Removed the ability to define the cache maintenance executor for the `DefaultMessageDistributor`.  This was only needed for testing RemovalListeners, which no longer exist.\r\n\r\n* I re-jiggered some of the integration tests to provide more information when they do fail. I removed the use of `waitOrTimeout` and replaced it with `assertEventually`.  I am also using a different style of assertion; Hamcrest-y.  These changes should provide additional information and also be more consistent with the rest of the code base.\r\n\r\n* After removing the dependency that provided `waitOrTimeout`, I had to rework some of the project dependencies because multiple versions of`httpclient` lib was being pulled in.  This caused the new REST function in `stellar-common` to blow up when a Stellar execution environment is loaded during the integration test.\r\n\r\n* Added additional debug logging for the caches including an estimate of the cache size.\r\n\r\n#### RemovalListener to CacheWriter\r\n\r\nProfiles are designed to expire and flush after a fixed period of time; the TTL.  The integration tests rely on some of the profile values being flushed by this TTL mechanism.  \r\n\r\nThe TTL mechanism is driven by cache expiration. There is a cache of \"active\" profiles.  This cache is configured to have values timeout after they have not been accessed for a fixed period of time.  Once they timeout from the active cache, they are placed on an \"expired\" cache.  Messages are not applied to expired profiles, but these expired profiles hang around for a fixed period of time to allow them to be flushed.\r\n\r\nPreviously, a Caffeine [RemovalListener](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Removal#removal-listeners) was used so that when a profile expires from the active cache, it is placed into the expired cache. When the tests fail, it seems that the `RemovalListener` is not notified in a timely fashion, so the profile doesn't make it to the expired cache and so never flushes to be read by the integration test.\r\n\r\n In Caffeine, these listeners are notified asynchronously, on a separate thread (via ForkJoinPool.commonPool()), not inline with cache reads or writes.  For running tests that depend on RemovalListeners, it is recommended to set the cache maintenance executor to something like `MoreExecutors.sameThreadExecutor()` so that cache maintenance is executed on the main execution thread when `cleanUp` is called.  This was done for the unit tests, but was not done for the integration tests. \r\n\r\nThe Caffeine Wiki mentions that when notification should be performed synchronously, which logically works for this use case, to use a [CacheWriter](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Writer) instead.\r\n\r\n> Removal listener operations are executed asynchronously using an Executor. The default executor is ForkJoinPool.commonPool() and can be overridden via Caffeine.executor(Executor). When the operation must be performed synchronously with the removal, use [CacheWriter](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Writer) instead.\r\n\r\nPrior to #1270 we were using Guava for these caches.  In Guava, the [default behavior is for the RemovalListeners is to run synchronously.](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained#removal-listeners)\r\n\r\n> Warning: removal listener operations are executed synchronously by default, and since cache maintenance is normally performed during normal cache operations, expensive removal listeners can slow down normal cache function! \r\n\r\nThis explains why the integration tests have only recently started to be a problem.  This also justifies the move to using a CacheWriter.  CacheWriters operate synchronously and so restores the behavior that we had prior to #1270.\r\n\r\nThis does not negatively impact production performance because the `ActiveCacheWriter` only does work on a delete which occurs only rarely when a profile stops receiving messages, not on a write.  In addition, these caches are very read-heavy as in most cases the cache is only written to when a new profile is defined or on topology start-up.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis makes node1 resolve to 127.0.0.1 inside of the VM, instead of 192.168.66.121 by not modifying /etc/hosts inside the guest.  One example of where this is important is that kafka only listens on 127.0.0.1:6667.  The alternative is we could configure things to point to the IP instead of node1.\r\n\r\nI left out fastcapa since I expected this may be useful in a dual VM scenario, but I haven't spun that up in years.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1889\r\n\r\nThis is done in reference to this discussion on the mailing list wrt deprecating the split join topology. https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e3a0f5634db74d44c4e2f2e0399cc3f0777f1e0dce2e1f764cc0a39f@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nThe split-join enrichment topology has the following timestamp keys:\r\n\r\n**Adapter timestamps**\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"adapter:hostfromjsonlistadapter:begin:ts\": \"1542840777691\",\r\n  \"adapter:hostfromjsonlistadapter:end:ts\": \"1542840777691\",\r\n  \"adapter:threatinteladapter:begin:ts\": \"1542840784545\",\r\n  \"adapter:threatinteladapter:end:ts\": \"1542840784545\",\r\n  \"adapter:geoadapter:begin:ts\": \"1542840783196\",\r\n  \"adapter:geoadapter:end:ts\": \"1542840783196\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Split and Join Bolt timestamps**\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"enrichmentsplitterbolt:splitter:begin:ts\": \"1542840777617\",\r\n  \"enrichmentsplitterbolt:splitter:end:ts\": \"1542840777617\",\r\n  \"enrichmentjoinbolt:joiner:ts\": \"1542840783234\",\r\n  \"threatintelsplitterbolt:splitter:begin:ts\": \"1542840783247\",\r\n  \"threatintelsplitterbolt:splitter:end:ts\": \"1542840783247\",\r\n  \"threatinteljoinbolt:joiner:ts\": \"1542840784555\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe unified enrichment topology currently only has the following timestamp\r\nkeys:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"parallelenricher:splitter:begin:ts\": \"1542807098066\",\r\n  \"parallelenricher:splitter:end:ts\": \"1542807098066\",\r\n  \"parallelenricher:enrich:begin:ts\": \"1542807098066\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe enrichment end timestamp is missing in the case when there are no enrichments. Also, the adapter timestamps did not carry over from the split-join topology.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I've corrected for the missing `enrich:end:ts` case for when there are no enrichments and added back in the adapter timestamps.\r\n\r\nThis is the new timestamp output for the unified enrichment topology after my changes:\r\n\r\n**Adapter timestamps**\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"adapter:geoadapter:begin:ts\": \"1542882553866\",\r\n  \"adapter:geoadapter:end:ts\": \"1542882553866\",\r\n  \"adapter:threatinteladapter:begin:ts\": \"1542882553869\",\r\n  \"adapter:threatinteladapter:end:ts\": \"1542882553870\",\r\n  \"adapter:hostfromjsonlistadapter:begin:ts\": \"1542882553866\",\r\n  \"adapter:hostfromjsonlistadapter:end:ts\": \"1542882553866\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Enrichment bolt timestamps**\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"parallelenricher:enrich:begin:ts\": \"1542882553869\",\r\n  \"parallelenricher:enrich:end:ts\": \"1542882553870\",\r\n  \"parallelenricher:splitter:begin:ts\": \"1542882553869\",\r\n  \"parallelenricher:splitter:end:ts\": \"1542882553869\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nSpin up full dev and you should see bro records in Elasticsearch (or Solr) that now contain the adapter timestamps. By default, the unified enrichment topology should be running, but make sure of this when you evaluate the records in the bro index.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nMetron Alert UI build broken by a removed transitive dependency. flatmap-steam was removed from npm because of vulnerability issues probably.\r\nBumping version of npm-run-all from 4.1.3 to 4.1.5 fixing the issue. \r\n\r\nWAY TO TEST:\r\n- check out current mater and run: npm ls flatmap-stream\r\n- it's gonna show you that it is a dependency of npm-run-all\r\n- run npm cache clean --force (to remove cached versions of the missing flatmap-stream)\r\n- run npm ci (it should fail)\r\n- checkout this pr branch\r\n- run npm ci (should pass)\r\n- rerun npm ls flatmap-stream\r\n- you should see that it's no longer a dependency\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our
