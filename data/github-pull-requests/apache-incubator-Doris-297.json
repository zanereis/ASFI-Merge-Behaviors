Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSupport lazy read for non-predicate columns in `ParquetReader`.\r\n\r\n## Method\r\nRead predicate columns firstly, and use `VExprContext`(push-down predicates) to generate the select vector, which is then applied to read the non-predicate columns.\r\nThe data in non-predicate columns may be skipped by select vector, so the value-decode-time can be reduced. If a whole page can be skipped, the decompress-time  can also be reduced.\r\n\r\n## Performance Test\r\nUsing one thread to query data in table with 10 million rows, and the table is generated from a [data generator tool](https://github.com/glebkorolkov/datagen) with all types supported by hive, and all values are random, and has a 10% probability of being null.\r\n1. No performance fallback in the worst case(filter_ration=10%, 50%)\r\n2. When filter_ration > 90%, the performance is more than doubled.\r\n![4INIM2Hwkh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19337507/200860805-5d00fad5-dd09-4c36-8432-902947f19fcf.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Remaining Problems\r\n1. Predicates with partition columns can't trigger lazy read. Support in later PR.\r\n2. Can't apply the later arrived runtime filters to lazy read.\r\n3. Even if a page can be skipped, the data in this page may be read (not decompressed) for [pre-reading](https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/12898). \r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis rule eliminate project that output set is same with its child. If the project is the root of plan, the elimination condition is project's output is exactly the same with its child.\r\n\r\nThe reason to add this rule is when we do join reorder in optimization, the root of plan after transformed maybe a Project and its output set is same with the root of plan before transformed. If we had a Project on the top of the root and its output set is same with the root of plan too. We will have two exactly same projects in memo. One of them is the parent of the other. After MergeProject, we will get a new Project exactly same like the child and need to add to parent's group. Then we trigger Merge Group. Since merge will produce a cycle, the merge will be denied and we will get a final plan with two consecutive projects.\r\n\r\n## for example:\r\n**BEFORE OPTIMIZATION**\r\n```\r\nLogicalProject1( projects=[c_custkey#0, c_name#1]) [GroupId#1]\r\n+--LogicalJoin(type=LEFT_SEMI_JOIN)                [GroupId#2]\r\n   |--LogicalProject(...)\r\n   |  +--LogicalJoin(type=INNER_JOIN)\r\n   |  ...\r\n   +--LogicalOlapScan(...)\r\n```\r\n**AFTER APPLY RULE: LOGICAL_SEMI_JOIN_LOGICAL_JOIN_TRANSPOSE_PROJECT**\r\n```\r\nLogicalProject1( projects=[c_custkey#0, c_name#1])    [GroupId#1]\r\n+--LogicalProject2( projects=[c_custkey#0, c_name#1]) [GroupId#2]\r\n   +--LogicalJoin(type=INNER_JOIN)                    [GroupId#10]\r\n      |--LogicalProject(...)\r\n      |  +--LogicalJoin(type=LEFT_SEMI_JOIN)\r\n      |  ...\r\n      +--LogicalOlapScan(...)\r\n```\r\n**AFTER APPLY RULE: MERGE_PROJECTS**\r\n```\r\nLogicalProject3( projects=[c_custkey#0, c_name#1])  [should be in GroupId#1, but in GroupId#2 in fact]\r\n+--LogicalJoin(type=INNER_JOIN)                     [GroupId#10]\r\n   |--LogicalProject(...)\r\n   |  +--LogicalJoin(type=LEFT_SEMI_JOIN)\r\n   |  ...\r\n   +--LogicalOlapScan(...)\r\n```\r\nSince we have exaclty GroupExpression(LogicalProject3 and LogicalProject2) in GroupId#1 and GroupId#2, we need to do MergeGroup(GroupId#1, GroupId#2). But we have child of GroupId#1 in GroupId#2. So the merge is denied.\r\nIf the best GroupExpression in GroupId#2 is LogicalProject3, we will get two consecutive projects in the final plan.\r\n\r\n# Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n# Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #13884\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWe pass `&index_key` (`std::string*`) to `IndexedColumnIterator::seek_at_or_after` and  reach the function `BinaryPrefixPageDecoder::seek_at_or_after_value` finally.\r\n\r\nIn function `BinaryPrefixPageDecoder::seek_at_or_after_value`, we cast the argument `value` (`&index_key`) to `Slice`. These types don't match.\r\n\r\nThe wrong type casting works well with **libstdc++**, but exposes some problems when we use **libc++**.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue close: #13628\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. Supports for persisting collected statistics to a pre-built OLAP table named `column_statistics`.\r\n2. Use a much simpler mechanism to collect statistics: all the gauges are collected in single one SQL for each partition and then the whole column, which defined in class `AnalysisJob`\r\n3. Implement a cache to manage the statistics records in FE\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n1. Use opentelemetry to monitor the execution time of each job\r\n2. Format the internal analysis SQL\r\n3. split SQL to promise the in expr's child count not exceeds the FE limits of generated SQL for deleting expired records\r\n4. Implements show statements\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n5. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n7. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n8. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #13622 \r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThis pr supports row policy  in nereids, which  did two things:\r\n1. 【new logical plan】add **LogicalCheckPolicy** before UnboundRelation in LogicalPlanBuilder.\r\neg: `select * from xxx;`\r\n       -- LogicalProject\r\n       ------ **LogicalCheckPolicy**\r\n       ---------- UnboundRelation\r\n2. 【new rule】In NereidsAnalyzer, turn **LogicalCheckPolicy** to LogicalFilter if row policy exist, otherwise remove it. \r\nIf there are multiple row policies, they will be merged into one, according to the original method.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n5. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n7. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n8. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1.\r\nSupport running transactional insert operation with new scan framework. eg:\r\n```\r\nadmin set frontend config(\"enable_new_load_scan_node\" = \"true\");\r\nbegin;\r\ninsert into tbl1 values(1,2);\r\ninsert into tbl1 values(3,4);\r\ninsert into tbl1 values(5,6);\r\ncommit;\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add some limitation to transactional insert\r\n    1. Do not support non-literal value in insert stmt\r\n\r\n3. Fix some issue about array type:\r\n    1. Forbid cast other non-array type to NESTED array type, it may cause BE crash.\r\n    2. Add `getStringValueForArray()` method for Expr, to get valid string-formatted array type value. \r\n\r\n4. Add `useLocalSessionState=true` in regression-test jdbc url\r\n    without this config, the jdbc driver will send some init cmd each time it connect to server, such as\r\n    `select @@session.tx_read_only`.\r\n    But when we use transactional insert, after `begin` command, Doris do not support any other type of\r\n    stmt except for `insert`, `commit` or `rollback`.\r\n    So adding this config to let the jdbc NOT send cmd when connecting.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n3. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n7. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n8. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-01T06:21:15Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T00:36:08Z","closed_at":"2022-11-03T00:36:08Z","merged_at":"2022-11-03T00:36:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b4c2cabb46f5dcfbec27251d64c15275d4fd6a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1705187220,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzA1MTg3MjIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/planner","name":"area/planner","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nIn the load test, the problem is analyzed according to the mem tracker, and it is found that:\r\n1. In the memtable insert stage, the memory recorded by the mem hook is less than that recorded manually, and the value recorded manually is closer to the real value.\r\n2. The memory value recorded by the mem hook is relatively accurate during the memtable flushing stage.\r\n3. The current mem tracker recording method has a high understanding threshold and is not easy to analyze.\r\n\r\nFor 3.\r\n- When the memory value of the mem table is greater than `config::write_buffer_size (default 200M), flush it, which depends on manually recording the memory;\r\n- `LoadChannelMgr` checks the total memory of all load channels before each add batch. If it exceeds the limit, select the load channel to flush, which relies on mem hook to record memory;\r\nIt is not easy to understand that two different memory recording methods are mixed;\r\n\r\nSo, I simplified the use of mem tracker, looking forward to better understanding.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. \r\nIn the previous implementation, the max thread num of olap scanner was set relatively small, such as 3.\r\nwhich would slow down some of queries.\r\nIn this PR, I changed the max thread num  to a quarter of the scaner thread pool(default is 12),\r\nwhich is less than the old scan node's max thread num, but larger than the previous implementation.\r\nThe upper limit of the max thread num of the old scan node is too high, which is not reasonable.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nLower down the number of pre allocated free blocks.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-30T15:50:32Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T06:00:06Z","closed_at":"2022-10-31T06:00:06Z","merged_at":"2022-10-31T06:00:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"2fb218173e2fb09af0fa048f4b115f0b1c3b2d99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates
