patch bumps the default frame version for kraft records from 0 to 1. At the same time, we reset all records versions back to 0 and we enable flexible version support for `UnregisterBrokerRecord`, which was missed previously. Note that the frame version bump also affects the KIP-405 records since they are sharing `AbstractApiMessageSerde`. Since these records were not part of any previous releases, I did not see a problem with this.\r\n \r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

We will always take the topic ID from the latest metadata response and remove any topic IDs from the cache if the metadata response did not return a topic ID for the topic.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of topic IDs, when we encounter a new topic ID (recreated topic) we can choose to get the topic's metadata even if the epoch is lower than the deleted topic.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that when we update from no topic IDs to using topic IDs, we will not count the topic as new (It could be the same topic but with a new ID). We will only take the update if the topic ID changed.\r\n\r\nAdded tests for this scenario as well as some tests for storing the topic IDs. Also added tests for topic IDs in metadata cache.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

when debugging things like continuous rebalancing in Streams, we want to check whether the input conditions to the assignor are stable and if not, why. One of the common scenarios is regular changes to the group membership resulting in an unstable/non-deterministic assignment, so it's very useful to be able to tell at a glance how many members are participating in the rebalance, and which ones are missing, if any. This is currently a pretty terrible experience to tease out of the existing logs, so let's just make our lives easier by logging the info we want directly. \r\n\r\nAlso fixes some warnings I saw when compiling.

patch adds a sanity-check bounce system test for the case where we have 3 co-located KRaft controllers and fixes the system test code so that this case will pass by starting brokers in parallel by default instead of serially.  We now also send SIGKILL to any running KRaft broker or controller nodes for the co-located case when a majority of co-located controllers have been stopped -- otherwise they do not shutdown, and we spin for the 60 second timeout.  Finally, this patch adds the ability to specify that certain brokers should not be started when starting the cluster, and then we can start those nodes at a later time via the `add_broker()` method call; this is going to be helpful for KRaft snapshot system testing.\r\n\r\nWe were not testing the 3 co-located KRaft controller case previously, and it would not pass because the first Kafka node would never be considered started.  We were starting the Kafka nodes serially, and we decide that a node has successfully started when it logs a particular message.  This message is not logged until the broker has identified the controller (i.e. the leader of the KRaft quorum).  There cannot be a leader until a majority of the KRaft quorum has started, so with 3 co-located controllers the first node could never be considered \"started\" by the system test. \r\n\r\n###

primary goal of this PR is to address the problem we've seen in the wild in which the ConsumerCoordinator fails to update its SubscriptionState and ultimately feeds invalid `ownedPartitions` data as input to the assignor. Previously the assignor would detect that something was wrong and just throw an exception, now we make several efforts to detect this earlier in the assignment process and then fix it if possible, and work around it if not.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this PR does a few things:\r\n1) Bring the `generation` field back to the CooperativeStickyAssignor so we don't need to rely so heavily on the ConsumerCoordinator properly updating its SubscriptionState after eg falling out of the group. The plain StickyAssignor always used the generation since it had to, so we just make sure the CooperativeStickyAssignor has this tool as well\r\n2) In case of unforeseen problems or further bugs that slip past the `generation` field safety net, the assignor will now explicitly look out for partitions that are being claimed by multiple consumers as owned in the same generation. Such a case should never occur, but if it does, we have to invalidate this partition from the `ownedPartitions` of both consumers, since we can't tell who, if anyone, has the valid claim to this partition.\r\n3) Fix a subtle bug that I discovered while writing tests for the above two fixes: in the constrained algorithm, we compute the exact number of partitions each consumer should end up with, and keep track of the \"unfilled\" members who must -- or _might_ -- require more partitions to hit their quota. The problem was that members at the `minQuota` were being considered as \"unfilled\" even after we had already hit the maximum number of consumers allowed to go up to the `maxQuota`, meaning those `minQuota` members could/should not accept any more partitions beyond that. I believe this was introduced in [#10509](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10509), so it shouldn't be in any released versions and does not need to be backported.","created_at":"2021-07-07T04:21:10Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T01:58:06Z","closed_at":"2021-07-14T01:29:31Z","merged_at":"2021-07-14T01:29:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"37d086fa2aa3aea07053304fe9758e104e6abb1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10985/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10985/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10985/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e269e26c50d6e0aa61e9931c9cf3e160754e56a6","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:12984-StickyAssignor-should-handle-invalid-input","ref":"12984-StickyAssignor-should-handle-invalid-input","sha":"e269e26c50d6e0aa61e9931c9cf3e160754e56a6","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

was updated to v3.6.3 via https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10918.  However, it was noted in that PR discussion (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10918#discussion_r663412933) that the dropwizard metrics-core library has since been updated from v3.2.5 to v4.1.12.1 for 3.7.x releases (via https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/commit/13fe0d0ffb9fd2c379b9b430aaaf9ee75acfceba).  Since there were no code changes associated with this library version bump in ZooKeeper, and since we wish to avoid potential CVEs if possible, we can consider updating to this newer version now assuming that system tests pass. I will attach system test results when they complete.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

KIP-699, we add some handler to handle different types of operation.

In [DescribeTransactionsHandler](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/internals/DescribeTransactionsHandler.java#L172-L186), there's already explained by Jason Gustafson why `COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE` and `NOT_COORDINATOR` should be listed in unmapped, and `COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS` should not.\r\n\r\n```java\r\ncase COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS:\r\n    // If the coordinator is in the middle of loading, then we just need to retry\r\n    log.debug(\"DescribeTransactions request for transactionalId `{}` failed because the \" +\r\n            \"coordinator is still in the process of loading state.

added support for batching in FindCoordinatorRequest using a new protocol that changes the wire format for both batched and unbatched requests. Clients were updated to try the new format first and switch irreversibly to the old format if the new format is not supported on one broker. During rolling upgrade (or a downgrade), it is possible that a broker doesn't support new format at some point while other brokers do at a later point. Clients end up in a bad state until restarted since use new version with old format. This PR changes FindCoordinatorRequest to set data based on actual version when a single group is used. This is always the case for consumer coordinator and transaction coordinator. For admin API, we still switch to unbatched mode on failure, but the data is set based on actual version, so we never fail even if brokers are upgraded/downgraded.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

implements the request and response portion of KIP-709: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=173084258. The Admin APIs will be implemented in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10964.\r\n\r\nIt updates the OffsetFetch request and response to support fetching offsets for multiple consumer groups at a time. If the broker does not support the new OffsetFetch version, clients can revert to the previous behaviour and use a request for each coordinator.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to get this change into the 3.0 release. We believe this change will be safe to check in as we are changing the request protocol, and not the underlying Admin APIs. As a result, we are not changing any major client side code, just updating the protocol for the brokers to support multiple groups for a `offsetFetch` request. We have also added substantial request/response testing to ensure we are having backward

the image/ module for storing, reading, and writing broker metadata\r\nimages. Metadat images are immutable. New images are produced from existing images\r\nusing delta classes. Delta classes are mutable, and represent changes to a base\r\nimage.\r\n\r\nMetadataImage objects can be converted to lists of KRaft metadata records. This\r\nis essentially writing a KRaft snapshot. The resulting snapshot can be read\r\nback into a MetadataDelta object. In practice, we will typically read the\r\nsnapshot, and then read a few more records to get fully up to date. After that,\r\nthe MetadataDelta can be converted to a MetadataImage as usual.\r\n\r\nSometimes, we have to load a snapshot even though we already have an existing\r\nnon-empty MetadataImage. We would do this if the broker fell too far behind and\r\nneeded to receive a snapshot to catch up. This is handled just like the normal\r\nsnapshot loading process. Anything that is not in the snapshot will be marked\r\nas deleted in the MetadataDelta once finishSnapshot() is called.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being used for reading and writing snapshots, MetadataImage also\r\nserves as a cache for broker information in memory. A follow-up PR will replace\r\nMetadataCache, CachedConfigRepository, and the client quotas cache with the\r\ncorresponding Image classes.

noticed test_mult_version was consistently failing. The issue was with the zookeeper option in the create topic call from a dev version node. I switched this so the 0 node was the old version, since the default in kafka.py is for node 0 to make the create topics call. I've confirmed the test now passes. \r\n\r\nGoing forward, we may want to consider how we are choosing to use the ZK option in the future. Right now it checks if all nodes support the bootstrap server, rather than the node making the call.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and
