SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen a dashboard is loaded in embedded mode, no 'Edit chart' functionality makes sense regardless of whether the guest user has `supersetCanExplore` permission.\r\nWhy? Because the `/explore` page isn't available in the DashboardEmbed mode so if the role provided for `GUEST_ROLE_NAME` has `supersetCanExplore` permission the 'Edit chart' functionality would not work (guest user will see a blank page in the embed mode)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds support for optionally rendering Jinja macros in the API response when getting a dataset. The motivation for this feature is that external tools might be fetching dataset metadata via the API to define lineage/etc, and in case Jinja is used it's not possible to fully parse the SQL query to identify dependencies/etc. An example query:\r\n\r\n``` sql\r\nselect * from {{dataset(1)}}\r\njoin cleaned_sales_data s on dataset_1.product_code = s.product_code\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe query parameter `include_rendered_sql` (bool) can be used to add keys to the response:\r\n* `rendered_sql` for the rendered virtual dataset SQL query.\r\n* `rendered_expression` for the rendered expression from `metrics` and `columns`.  \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nPR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30438 introduced optimizations to enhance performance by reducing backend requests for cross and native filters. However, due to a lack of clarity around the specific use cases these functionalities are meant to support, and in response to reports of certain broken use cases (such as https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30687), this PR simplifies the scoping logic to accommodate all use cases while still addressing the original issue of preventing requests for charts that are out of scope.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n- When in global scope, all charts will be affected by the filter\r\n- When in specific scope, only the selected charts will be affected by the filter\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30687\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a native or cross filter\r\n2. Change the scope to be global\r\n3. All charts will be affected by the filter\r\n4. Change the scope to only specific charts\r\n5. Only charts that were selected should be affected by the filter\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

fix(echarts): confidence interval does not display correctly for mixed time series charts with negative values\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe root cause of this problem lies within the order of the arguments sent to the echarts library. When working with time-series data, Echarts enforces specific constraints on how the x-axis bounds are configured. These constraints include:\r\nIn other words, the Echarts Library accepts input in this specific format and will malfunction otherwise. Superset does not create the Echarts modal with the options in this order.\r\n \r\n*  The `xaxis.type` option must be explicitly set to `'time'`.\r\n*  The `upper` and `lower` bound values must be equal to the lower bound.\r\n*  The `upper` bound must be defined before the `lower` bound in the options object.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the code in Superset that generates the Echarts configuration does not adhere to this required format, leading to the observed malfunction. This pull request rectifies this issue by reordering the `upper` and `lower` bound arguments before they are passed to the Echarts library.\r\n\r\n[What is currently being

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where Jinja in columns was not considered during cache key checks, leading to cache spillover.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Create an aggregated table chart using the `Vehicle Sales` dataset from the `examples` connection.\r\n2. Create below dimensions:\r\n    a. `'{{current_user_id()}}'` as `id`\r\n    a. `'{{current_username()}}'` as `username`\r\n    a. `'{{current_user_email()}}'` as `email`\r\n    a. `'{{url_param('test', 'default')}}'` as `url_param`\r\n3. Set the row limit to 1.\r\n4. Save the chart to a dashboard and access it.\r\n5. Notice that the user-related macros will show your account data, and the `url_param` column will show `default` (which is set in the macro to be returned when the param is not defined).\r\n6. Copy the dashboard URL, and append `&test=blah` to it (after the `native_filters_key` value) and access it.\r\n7. The `url_param` column should now how the param value (`blah`).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nThe table content and other page elements are misaligned with the center.\r\nThis issue arises because the text-align property is applied to the entire chart container instead of just the loading container in #27611. This commit resolves the problem by applying `text-align: center` to the loading message container.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n|Before|After|\r\n|--|--|\r\n|![Screenshot

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n- It fixes an issue for which colors would sometimes not keep their consistency when leaving and revisiting the Dashboard.\r\n- It fixes an issue for which charts original color schemes were not tracked making falling back to their origin color scheme impossible when removing the color scheme from the Dashboard.\r\n- It attempts to fix and re-enable skipped E2E tests that are critical for the coverage of the color consistency implementation.\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/23874 with limitations:\r\n  - The color scheme cannot be changed if the chart shares labels with multiple charts in the Dashboard. \r\n  - When setting custom label colors via the advanced settings of the Dashboard, the custom label colors will always be enforced also when a color scheme is not set for the Dashboard. \r\n  - The chart should consistently display colors that match those used in the Dashboard. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d66e66ff-13ec-4bb1-a1bf-72f6afcd1bfc\r\n\r\n###

Open a Dashboard with a color scheme and shared label colors\r\n2. Edit the Dashboard properties and remove the color scheme\r\n3. After applying the changes, verify that shared label colors are still respected\r\n4. For charts that do not share labels, verify their original color scheme is respected\r\n5. Save and exit the Dashboard by going to the Dashboard lists\r\n6. Come back again to the same Dashboard you just saved\r\n7. Make sure colors haven't changed from the previous state\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR introduces a separate endpoint to store changes to the Native Filters form. Previously, the native filters form would attempt to save the filters even if no changes were made. The form was also sending the whole JSON object containing every individual filter, which caused unnecessary overhead. This PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- Sends a request to the new /filters endpoint only when changes are required\r\n- It sends only new or modified native filters\r\n- It sends only an ID reference for re-ordered or deleted filters\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. The native filters form should work normally\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n

Summary\r\nThis pull request addresses an issue with the logging behavior in the `docker/docker-init.sh` script when loading examples in Apache Superset. The change ensures that the number of steps logged during the initialization process reflects whether example data should be loaded, thus preventing confusion in the logs. It was actually confusing in my case when I first ran superset in docker in different modes.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n- Modified the `STEP_CNT` variable initialization logic in the `docker/docker-init.sh` script.\r\n- Added a conditional check to set `STEP_CNT` properly.\r\n\r\n### Testing Instructions\r\n1. Verify that the environment variable `SUPSET_LOAD_EXAMPLES` can be set to either `\"yes\"` or `\"no\"`.\r\n2. Deploy the superset environment in different modes and observe the logs.","created_at":"2024-10-15T09:32:36Z","updated_at":"2024-10-15T17:55:38Z","closed_at":"2024-10-15T17:55:14Z","merged_at":"2024-10-15T17:55:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"d6b2e86155184e6abe26a4c39d6841ed6130627b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/30606/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/30606/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/30606/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/statuses/9911c1f07400286a4a5a893de351943197521d49","head":{"label":"deathstrokedarksky:init-logs-fix","ref":"init-logs-fix","sha":"9911c1f07400286a4a5a893de351943197521d49","user":{"login":"deathstrokedarksky","id":42295524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjk1NTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42295524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky","html_url":"https://github.com/deathstrokedarksky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":872907034,"node_id":"R_kgDONAeBGg","name":"superset","full_name":"deathstrokedarksky/superset","private":false,"owner":{"login":"deathstrokedarksky","id":42295524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMjk1NTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42295524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky","html_url":"https://github.com/deathstrokedarksky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deathstrokedarksky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/deathstrokedarksky/superset","description":"Apache

SUMMARY\r\nBump `pretty-ms` from 7.0.0 to 9.1.0, as this package hasn't been bumped in a long time. [Notable changes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pretty-ms/releases):\r\n- 7.0.1: Fix to `colonNotation` for sub-second durations (the lock file was actually already pointing to 7.0.1)\r\n- 8.0.0: Drop support for CJS\r\n- 9.0.0 Support BigInt\r\n- 9.1.0 Support negative durations\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Refactor tests from `describe` + `it` to `test`.\r\n- Add tests for negative durations, as those are now supported since 9.1.0. I recommend reviewing the diff with \"Hide whitespace\" to see the new tests.\r\n- Do a few minor tweaks to get `jest` working with the new version, as `pretty-ms` and `parse-ms` are now fully ESM.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe bug occurs when you have a mixed time series chart inside a dashboard and the time range filter from the dashboard does not apply to both queries of the mixed time series chart. If you compare the changes, the previous code would only take care of the adhoc_filters key. The changes make sure that all the adhoc filters keys of the regex /^adhoc_filters/ receive the adhoc time range filter. In case of mixed time series there are two keys namely, adhoc_filters and adhoc_filters_b.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAn improvement to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30350.\r\n\r\nToday, when a DB engine spec has no corresponding `sqlglot` dialect, we use a generic one to parse queries, which works fine. When converting the AST back to a string to pretty-print SQL, though, we hit a problem: in some databases the query becomes invalid. For example, this Firebolt query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 WHERE col1 NOT IN (1, 2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nGets formatted to:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t1 WHERE NOT col1 IN (1, 2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile these two queries are equivalent, the latter is invalid in Firebolt:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLine 1, Column 24: operator 'not' for input types (integer) not found, try adding explicit casts.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe long term solution is to add a Firebolt dialect to `sqlglot`, at least handling this edge case. As a more generic solution, this PR implements logic where, when a DB engine spec doesn't have a corresponding dialect in `sqlglot`, the query is pretty-printed using `sqlparse.format`. This way we have the strictness and correctness of `sqlglot` when parsing queries, and the leniency of `sqlparse` when formatting them.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe issue is caused by a custom style in the forked version of cosmo bootswatch.less that was added in the original [multi-panel sqllab PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/514/). The style overrides the caret style that is part of the bootstrap dropdown.less and references the FontAwesome font which is no longer included. The fix updates the bootswatch style to use Glyphicons down-chevron icon that is similar to the icons used in the React implementations. An alternative would be to remove the style from bootswatch completely, which can be seen in the ALTERNATE screenshot below.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBEFORE:\r\n![show_user_current](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85ed4541-fd1c-4c39-a3cb-0dff1740d959)\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\n![show_user_proposed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/029806ed-ebda-4929-8cc9-cfb6e5b9d9fc)\r\n\r\nALTERNATE: would be implemented by completely removing the caret style in the forked bootswatch.less and allowing boostrap dropdowns.less style to be applied:\r\n\r\n![show_user_alternate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ab4d7f8-5b4f-4652-8837-e47c5b04ffdc)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26476 introduced a `SQLGLOT_DIALECTS` mapping to be used when parsing SQL queries with SQLGlot. For companies that have custom database engines, with a name not present in the mapping, the default SQLGlot dialect would be used and could generate problems such as https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30551. This PR adds a new configuration to allow extending registered SQLGlot dialects.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30551\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCheck the original

new memory units adaptive formatter to format bytes units into kB, MB, GB, etc.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nMemory unit (bytes) is typically formatted into kB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), etc.\r\nSuperset formatting options don't enable adaptive formatting with proper unit naming in case of bytes values.\r\nThere are two most commonly used multi-byte unit types (according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)), this PR implements them both.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e619b401-1df4-46a0-8fb8-86305ba21be8)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Create a Chart, for example Table, with at least one numeric data column.\r\n2. Edit the Chart, in the \"Customize\" tab select one of \"Memory in bytes\" options for formatting of your numeric column.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe regex for `ExtraCache` that checks whether the statement has extra cache key calls via `has_extra_cache_key_calls` wasn't considering cases where the callable vars might not be in double curly brackets, such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{% set customer_id = current_user_email() %}\r\nselect '{{customer_id}}' as test;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of this issue, cached queries for charts would show previously cached data potentially exposing information from other users.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dataset using \r\n```\r\n{% set customer_id = current_user_email() %}\r\nselect '{{customer_id}}' as test;\r\n```\r\n2. Create a table chart based on the dataset\r\n3. Add the chart to a Dashboard\r\n4. Login with another user\r\n5. You should see the current user email\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n#23421 introduced a regression, where passwords containing `@` characters would break migrations. To avoid having to decode the URL, we can simply escape the connection string for variable interpolation by doubling `%` chars, after which the original encoded connection string works as expected.\r\n\r\nNote, that the change is functionally identical to the change proposed in the linked issue.\r\n\r\nHere's one of many similar StackOverflow threads: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39849641/in-flask-migrate-valueerror-invalid-interpolation-syntax-in-connection-string-a\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThis has been tested with a Postgres connection with a huge amount of special characters in the password, including `@` that previously broke the migration workflow.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has

performance issues in SQL Lab, where large query result payloads caused the browser to hang. This issue was noticeable even when result sets contained only a few rows (e.g., 1-10 rows), but the payload was quite large. The large payloads overwhelmed the browser’s ability to render the data, resulting in crashes or freezing.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1199\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-06 at 3 05 03 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d44c9d-a990-4e9b-a86c-41318f8485b7\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1194\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-06 at 3 11 17 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/392f670d-4c1d-49e4-bfdc-cd55919d90ec\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTest by running a query that generates a large-sized result (e.g., > 100 MB), and verify that an appropriate error message is triggered if the result size becomes too large to handle efficiently. The size limit, after which the handling logic is triggered, can be defined in the Superset config file under SQL_LAB_PAYLOAD_MAX_MB.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen importing charts, dashboards, and databases, certain databases (BigQuery) require credentials to be entered into the encrypted extra field for authorization. When importing this type of database, or any chart or dashboard that relies on this type of database, the db creation will fail generating an import failed error.\r\n\r\nThis fix implements a try except block to catch connection errors when attempting to populate db catalogs when importing a db. It prevents bigquery exceptions from being remapped to generic Exception types.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/ca5efd11ba004c19aea9c83484bdab47?sid=6be35dfc-42e1-45b2-81dd-0a8df1d41dd6\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/a9cc247ddb434ee198f81503514f6776?sid=93c7481f-9ace-4def-9862-6567ecf2f32b\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nExport a bigquery database or a chart/dashboard linked to a bigquery db.\r\nDelete the underlying db\r\nAttempt to import the db, chart, or dashboard.\r\nThe import should be successful, even though the db does not have auth creds\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes the behavior when opening a column-related Explore control and no column was selected. Previously, if the dataset had any saved column, the Saved tab would be the default selected tab. This created a lot of confusion for our users as generally the number of saved columns is significantly smaller than the number of dataset columns. Also, the users are generally looking for the normal dataset columns and didn't notice that they had to switch to the `Simple` tab to find them. With this PR, the behavior will be:\r\n- If there's no selected column, the Simple tab will be selected by default\r\n- If there is a selected column, the tab that corresponds to its type will be selected by default\r\n\r\nI also added tests for each use case.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new component for showing SQL parsing errors in SQL Lab (based on the exception raised by `sqlglot`), and also improves the `<ErrorMessageWithStackTrace/>` to show multiple error messages.\r\n\r\nIn the example below, there is an error parsing the query. When DML is enabled in the database Superset will run a query even if it can't parse it, but when it's disabled it raises an error. With the modifications, the user will see two error messages:\r\n\r\n1. The SQL can't be parsed; and\r\n2. Parsing is needed because DML is disabled.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 13-52-55 Superset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc8bb01-feca-4687-bdc2-b52c95db1217)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 13-53-03 Superset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba535f30-f792-4f24-a046-3b15db89c704)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
