My Kotlin version was 1.8.10 and was using Jackson in my code. I saw a weird reflection-related error in my code. The debugging ended up with a finding that the Pulsar broker was bringing the Kotlin library dependency which was version 1.4.32 and that was getting loaded before my version. Hence my sink was using the older version of a specific class. While looking for Kotlin support in Pulsar code and feedback from the committers in this PR, I realized that Pulsar code is not using the Kotlin library directly but it is a transitive dependency. The latest stable version of the main dependency(okhttp3) bringing Kotlin(1.6.20) as a transitive dependency doesn't use the latest version of Kotlin(1.8.10). Hence, updated `okhttp3`, `okio`, and `Kotlin` separately for the convenience of an existing structure. \r\n\r\nPutting the exception that I got here. (Not sure whether that is required):\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: kotlin.reflect.jvm.internal.KotlinReflectionInternalError: Cannot create type for an unsupported classifier: class kotlin.Unit (Kotlin reflection is not available) (class kotlin.jvm.internal.ClassReference)\r\n        at kotlin.reflect.full.KClassifiers.createType(KClassifiers.kt:48) ~[kotlin-reflect-1.8.10.jar:1.8.10-release-430(1.8.10)]\r\n        at kotlin.reflect.full.KClassifiers.createType$default(KClassifiers.kt:42) ~[kotlin-reflect-1.8.10.jar:1.8.10-release-430(1.8.10)]\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.KotlinAnnotationIntrospector.<clinit>(KotlinAnnotationIntrospector.kt:218) ~[jackson-module-kotlin-2.14.2.jar:2.14.2]\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.KotlinModule.setupModule(KotlinModule.kt:121) ~[jackson-module-kotlin-2.14.2.jar:2.14.2]\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.registerModule(ObjectMapper.java:853) ~[com.fasterxml.jackson.core-jackson-databind-2.13.4.2.jar:2.13.4.2]\r\n```\r\nHere `kotlin.Unit` class is loaded from `Kotlin 1.4.32` whereas Jackson was compiled with `Kotlin 1.5.32`.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Upgraded transitive `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib` library from `1.4.32` to `1.8.10`\r\n* Upgraded transitive `okhttp3` version from `4.9.3` to `4.10.0`\r\n* Upgraded transitive `okio` version from `2.8.0` to `3.0.0`\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/wiki/proposals/PIP.md -->\r\nThe fork pr: https://github.com/horizonzy/pulsar/pull/12\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nAfter #13833, we change the signature of LedgerOffloaderFactory#create.\r\n\r\nBefore: no offloaderStats.\r\n```\r\n    default T create(OffloadPoliciesImpl offloadPolicies,\r\n                     Map<String, String> userMetadata,\r\n                     SchemaStorage schemaStorage,\r\n                     OrderedScheduler scheduler)\r\n            throws IOException {\r\n        return create(offloadPolicies, userMetadata, scheduler);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAfter: add offloaderStats.\r\n```\r\n    default T create(OffloadPoliciesImpl offloadPolicies,\r\n                     Map<String, String> userMetadata,\r\n                     SchemaStorage schemaStorage,\r\n                     OrderedScheduler scheduler,\r\n                     LedgerOffloaderStats offloaderStats)\r\n            throws IOException {\r\n        return create(offloadPolicies, userMetadata, scheduler, offloaderStats);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in PulsarService#createManagedLedgerOffloader line_1402, it changes the way to create an offloader.\r\n\r\nBefore: no offloaderStats\r\n```\r\n                    return offloaderFactory.create(\r\n                        offloadPolicies,\r\n                        ImmutableMap.of(\r\n                            LedgerOffloader.METADATA_SOFTWARE_VERSION_KEY.toLowerCase(), PulsarVersion.getVersion(),\r\n                            LedgerOffloader.METADATA_SOFTWARE_GITSHA_KEY.toLowerCase(), PulsarVersion.getGitSha(),\r\n                            LedgerOffloader.METADATA_PULSAR_CLUSTER_NAME.toLowerCase(), config.getClusterName()\r\n                        ),\r\n                        schemaStorage,\r\n                        getOffloaderScheduler(offloadPolicies));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter: add offloaderStats\r\n```\r\nreturn offloaderFactory.create(\r\n                        offloadPolicies,\r\n                        ImmutableMap.of(\r\n                            LedgerOffloader.METADATA_SOFTWARE_VERSION_KEY.toLowerCase(), PulsarVersion.getVersion(),\r\n                            LedgerOffloader.METADATA_SOFTWARE_GITSHA_KEY.toLowerCase(), PulsarVersion.getGitSha(),\r\n                            LedgerOffloader.METADATA_PULSAR_CLUSTER_NAME.toLowerCase(), config.getClusterName()\r\n                        ),\r\n                        schemaStorage, getOffloaderScheduler(offloadPolicies), this.offloaderStats);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBut some users may use the old version LedgerOffloaderFactory in the offloader nar, when pulsar load the offloader nar, it will use the LedgerOffloaderFactory in the offloader nar, the LedgerOffloaderFactory#create has no param `offloaderStats`. Then it will throw an exception as follows:\r\n```\r\n2023-03-23T23:59:42,947 - ERROR - [main:PulsarService@918] - Failed to start Pulsar service: java.lang.AbstractMethodError: Receiver class io.streamnative.tieredstorage.pulsar.PulsarOffloaderFactory does not define or inherit an implementation of the resolved method 'abstract org.apache.bookkeeper.mledger.LedgerOffloader create(org.apache.pulsar.common.policies.data.OffloadPoliciesImpl, java.util.Map, org.apache.bookkeeper.common.util.OrderedScheduler, org.apache.bookkeeper.mledger.LedgerOffloaderStats)' of interface org.apache.bookkeeper.mledger.LedgerOffloaderFactory.\r\norg.apache.pulsar.broker.PulsarServerException: java.lang.AbstractMethodError: Receiver class io.streamnative.tieredstorage.pulsar.PulsarOffloaderFactory does not define or inherit an implementation of the resolved method 'abstract org.apache.bookkeeper.mledger.LedgerOffloader create(org.apache.pulsar.common.policies.data.OffloadPoliciesImpl, java.util.Map, org.apache.bookkeeper.common.util.OrderedScheduler, org.apache.bookkeeper.mledger.LedgerOffloaderStats)' of interface org.apache.bookkeeper.mledger.LedgerOffloaderFactory.\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.broker.PulsarService.createManagedLedgerOffloader(PulsarService.java:1422) ~[classes/:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.broker.PulsarService.start(PulsarService.java:780) ~[classes/:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.PulsarBrokerStarter$BrokerStarter.start(PulsarBrokerStarter.java:276) ~[classes/:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.pulsar.PulsarBrokerStarter.main(PulsarBrokerStarter.java:356) ~[classes/:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we should make LedgerOffloaderFactory#create compatible with the previous version, and revert the origin signature to LedgerOffloaderFactory for compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the user upgrades the `managed-ledger` dependency(LedgerOffloaderFactory is defined in `managed-ledger`). So the user offloader nar LedgerOffloaderFactory has both methods. One is with offloaderStats, another one is without offloaderStats.\r\n\r\nIf the pulsar is the old version, it loads the offloader nar, and using LedgerOffloaderFactory#create without offloadStats to create offloader. It works.\r\n\r\nIf the pulsar is the new version, it loads the offloader nar, and using LedgerOffloaderFactory#create with offloadStats to create the offloader.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn CI, there are some occurrences of failed maven downloads. [For example](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/actions/runs/4489637889/jobs/7896090250#step:11:74):\r\n```\r\n  Error:  Failed to execute goal on project pulsar-broker: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.apache.pulsar:pulsar-broker:jar:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT:\r\nCould not transfer artifact org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-http:jar:9.4.48.v20220622 from/to central (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2): \r\ntransfer failed for https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/jetty-http/9.4.48.v20220622/jetty-http-9.4.48.v20220622.jar: \r\nConnect to repo1.maven.org:443 [repo1.maven.org/151.101.40.209] failed: \r\nConnection timed out -> [Help 1]\r\n```\r\nRetries are enabled, but it turns out that there \r\nare additional settings in Maven for configuring retries when a download fails after it has started successfully\r\nor when the server returns a 5xx error.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd `-Dmaven.wagon.http.retryHandler.requestSentEnabled=true -Dmaven.wagon.http.serviceUnavailableRetryStrategy.class=standard -Dmaven.wagon.rto=60000` to `MAVEN_OPTS`\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThe CI uses currently Maven 3.8.7 . In Maven 3.9.x, the downloading uses different libraries (maven-resolver instead of maven-wagon, see https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-resolver-transport.html). The configuration options for Maven 3.9.x will require revisiting once GitHub Actions upgrades to use Maven 3.9.x+ .\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#16763 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation & Modifications\r\n\r\n* Make clear delayed message operation asynchronous\r\n* Clear delayed message when unsubscribe to avoid residual snapshot\r\n* Make update cursor property operation serialization by `FutureUtil.Sequence` (merge PR https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19850 into this PR)\r\n* Use `immutableBuckets.asMapOfRanges().remove()` instead of `immutableBuckets.remove()`\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick

Motivation\r\n\r\nIf the message field of ErrorCommand is null value, the ErrorCommand can't be created successfully, leading to the client can't receive ErrorCommand.\r\n\r\nIn general, we send ErrorCommand in the `exceptionally` block, so the NPE has been ignored.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1339\" alt=\"image\"

ErrorCommand creation failure.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\nFixes #19885\r\n\r\n<!-- or this PR is one task of an issue -->\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #xyz\r\n\r\n<!-- If the PR belongs to a PIP, please add the PIP link here -->\r\n\r\nPIP: #xyz \r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/wiki/proposals/PIP.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nJavaInstanceStarter still cannot infer type class name\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. create a new `FunctionCacheManager` in `JavaInstanceStarter` to create the function class loader and pass this `fnCache` to `ThreadRuntimeFactory`'s constructor method.\r\n2. create a new constructor method for `ThreadRuntimeFactory`, which add a `fnCache` parameter so that it can reuse the `fnCache` created in `JavaInstanceStarter`\r\n3. make `ThreadRuntime#loadJars` public so it can be called in the `JavaInstanceStarter`\r\n4. use the function class loader to infer type class instead of the instance class loader(which cannot load the user's function class)\r\n5. check whether `userConfigs` is null before calling `userConfigs.containsKey`\r\n6. use `functionDetailsBuilder.getSink().getClassName()` to load sink class instead of `functionDetailsBuilder.getClassName()` since this one is always `org.apache.pulsar.functions.api.utils.IdentityFunction`\r\n7. use `functionDetailsBuilder.getSource().getClassName(), classLoader` to load source class instead of `functionDetailsBuilder.getClassName()` since this one is always `org.apache.pulsar.functions.api.utils.IdentityFunction`\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\n- [x] This change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION. CHECK THE PROPER BOX ONLY. -->\r\n\r\n*If the box was checked, please highlight the changes*\r\n\r\n- [ ] Dependencies (add or upgrade a dependency)\r\n- [ ] The public API\r\n- [ ] The schema\r\n- [ ] The default values of configurations\r\n- [ ] The threading model\r\n- [ ] The binary protocol\r\n- [ ] The REST endpoints\r\n- [ ] The admin CLI options\r\n- [ ] The metrics\r\n- [ ] Anything that affects deployment\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in \r\na forked repository.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be run in the forked repository until all PR review comments have\r\nbeen handled, the tests pass and the PR is approved by a reviewer.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-22T07:58:31Z","updated_at":"2023-08-07T04:23:11Z","closed_at":"2023-05-24T08:41:53Z","merged_at":"2023-05-24T08:41:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"05e57dd3a443c5b99c21054c56a1b497455fa867","assignee":{"login":"jiangpengcheng","id":1858477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTg0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangpengcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jiangpengcheng","id":1858477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTg0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1858477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangpengcheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangpengcheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":853313264,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTMzMTMyNjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/area/function","name":"area/function","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3125409143,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTI1NDA5MTQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/doc-not-needed","name":"doc-not-needed","color":"e0e0e0","default":false,"description":"Your

#19864  \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThis is a draft PR to show one potential way that we could use feedback from the client to influence how an exclusive and a failover consumer reconnect to the broker. The PR hastily put together, so it doesn't necessarily cover all edge cases.\r\n\r\nFurther, I think the `startMessageId` sent by the client could easily be the newest message in the `incomingMessages` queue since there is no need to resend those messages in this scenario.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR does not include logic to handle the case where the client was forcefully disconnected from the broker. That is a case where we would not want to use the provided `startMessageId`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x]

Motivation\r\nAdd a ModularLoadManagerStrategy used with UniformLoadShedder;\r\nLeastLongTermMessageRate only takes msgRate into account, while UniformLoadShedder takes both msgRate and throughputRate into account.\r\n\r\nSo we need to add a ModularLoadManagerStrategy to adapt UniformLoadShedder.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nAdd a ModularLoadManagerStrategy : UniformMessageRate\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Motivation\r\nThe configuration is as follows:\r\n```\r\nloadBalancerMsgThroughputMultiplierDifferenceShedderThreshold=0\r\nloadBalancerMsgRateDifferenceShedderThreshold=50\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope that the balance only considers msgRate, but as a result, when selecting overloadedBroker and underloadedBroker, the broker with the largest and smallest msgRate will never be selected;\r\nfor example:\r\n```\r\nbroker1 msgRate=10 throughputRate=20\r\nbroker2 msgRate=30 throughputRate=10\r\nbroker3 msgRate=10 throughputRate=40\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe final selected overloadedBroker=broker3 underloadedBroker=broker3;\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the order of traversing brokers is changed, the selection results are completely different:\r\n```\r\nbroker3 msgRate=10 throughputRate=40\r\nbroker2 msgRate=30 throughputRate=10\r\nbroker1 msgRate=10 throughputRate=20\r\n```\r\nThe final selected overloadedBroker=broker1 underloadedBroker=broker1;\r\n\r\nWhen overloadedBroker and underloadedBroker are selected, loadBalancerMsgRateDifferenceShedderThreshold and loadBalancerMsgThroughputMultiplierDifferenceShedderThreshold configurations are not considered：\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/30d2469086fea989ac8baf059df8e69c66a68d89/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/loadbalance/impl/UniformLoadShedder.java#L72-L86\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nWhen selecting overloadedBroker and underloadedBroker, you need to consider the configuration of loadBalancerMsgRateDifferenceShedderThreshold and loadBalancerMsgThroughputMultiplierDifferenceShedderThreshold:\r\n```\r\nbrokersData.forEach((broker, data) -> {\r\n            double msgRate = data.getLocalData().getMsgRateIn() + data.getLocalData().getMsgRateOut();\r\n            double throughputRate = data.getLocalData().getMsgThroughputIn()\r\n                    + data.getLocalData().getMsgThroughputOut();\r\n            if ( ((conf.getLoadBalancerMsgRateDifferenceShedderThreshold() > 0)\r\n                    && (msgRate > maxMsgRate.getValue())) ||\r\n                    ((conf.getLoadBalancerMsgThroughputMultiplierDifferenceShedderThreshold() > 0)\r\n                            && (throughputRate > maxThroughputRate.getValue()))) {\r\n                overloadedBroker.setValue(broker);\r\n                maxMsgRate.setValue(msgRate);\r\n                maxThroughputRate.setValue(throughputRate);\r\n            }\r\n            if (((conf.getLoadBalancerMsgRateDifferenceShedderThreshold() > 0) && (msgRate < minMsgRate.getValue()))\r\n                    || ((conf.getLoadBalancerMsgThroughputMultiplierDifferenceShedderThreshold() > 0)\r\n                    && (throughputRate < minThroughputRate.getValue()))) {\r\n                underloadedBroker.setValue(broker);\r\n                minMsgRate.setValue(msgRate);\r\n                minThroughputRate.setValue(throughputRate);\r\n            }\r\n

Motivation\r\nIn the updateBundleData method, when the following code is

#19771  \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn order to make OIDC work with functions, we must give them a way to authenticate with the broker using tokens that are able to be validated by an using an Authorization Server. This PR introduces the `KubernetesServiceAccountAuthProvider`.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Create an `KubernetesServiceAccountAuthProvider` implementation. It adds a service account token volume projection as defined in the k8s docs [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-token-volume-projection). The implementation provides a way to specify the expiration time that the token will receive.\r\n\r\n* Instead of creating a secret with the broker's trusted `ca.crt` in it, this new `KubernetesServiceAccountAuthProvider` expects a secret to already exist with the `ca.crt`. The major advantage for this implementation is that when the `ca.crt` is rotated, we can refresh it (assuming the client is configured to observe the updated file).\r\n\r\n* Add support for specifying the token's expiration and audience.\r\n\r\n* One point of divergence from the `KubernetesSecretsTokenAuthProvider` implementation is that I did not provide a way for functions to authenticate as the anonymous role. It seems like a stretch that functions would use such authentication because it will not be multi-tenant. However, if that is a concern, we can add the support.\r\n\r\n* The feature will be configured with the following yaml:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nfunctionRuntimeFactoryConfigs:\r\n  kubernetesFunctionAuthProviderConfig:\r\n    brokerClientTrustCertsSecretName: \"secret-name\"\r\n    serviceAccountTokenExpirationSeconds: 3600\r\n    serviceAccountTokenAudience: \"pulsar-cluster-audience\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI verified the correctness of the code with unit tests. I'll verify the integration with k8s once we've determined this PR's design is correct.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\nThis adds new configuration options to the function worker.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] `doc-required`\r\n\r\n### Matching PR in forked repository\r\n\r\nPR in forked repository:

Motivation\r\n\r\nThere are many cases when a broker is not able to load the topic successfully and it requires examining the metadata of topic/schema/managed-ledger etc for example: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19882 . But all such metadata is stored in binary in metadata/zk and it really requires to broker admin API to fetch internal info of the topic. Therefore, issue like in PR# 19882 requires users to retrieve schema ledger metadata for further debugging even if topic is not successfully loaded. so, add topic's schema metadata into topic's internal-info API which doesn't depend on loaded topic.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd schema ledger metadata into topics' offline internal-metadata api.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nFor a multi-topics consumer, when it acknowledges a single message, it will first find the owner topic from its message ID. If the owner topic is not subscribed by the consumer, `NotConnectedException` will be thrown.\r\n\r\nHowever, when it acknowledges multiple messages, if any of them is the message whose owner topic is not subscribed by the consumer, NPE will happen instead.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nWhen acknowledging multiple messages, if there is any message ID whose owner topic is not subscribed, fail the whole acknowledgment. `testAckMessageInAnotherTopic` is added to cover this case.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\nThere are many other places that do not check if `consumers.get` returns `null`, like `doReconsumeLater`, `negativeAcknowledge`, etc. This patch does not cover them.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#16763 \r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/wiki/proposals/PIP.md -->\r\n### Motivation & Modifications\r\n\r\n* Make bucket merge operation asynchronous.\r\n* Optimize the logic of selecting bucket, find two adjacent buckets with the min schedule time and the least number of indexes to merge, avoid preload indexes that have not expired for a long time.\r\n* Add min_schedule_timestamp in SnapshotSegmentMetadata (It is also used later to implement lazy load)\r\n* Fix leak in snapshotSegmentLastIndexTable\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nUse `bin/pulsar-admin topics partitioned-stats` get partitioned topic stats, subscription's `messageAckRate` always be 0.\r\n![stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65590138/226510275-afd52c9f-871a-47ee-85f5-6c65aa97ad9c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nFix the aggregation logic of subscription stats. \r\nAccording to the code, `chunkedMessageRate` has same issue.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does

Motivation\r\n\r\nPulsar client encryption allows user to use external plugin to fetch private/public keys and if there is any failure during retrieving those keys then pulsar client doesn't log

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/19792\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\nFix flaky test MetadataStoreStatsTest.testBatchMetadataStoreMetrics\r\n\r\nprevious is forcus to find which MetadataStore is create with set name and not close. but almost 40% UT didn't set name.\r\nit is very hard to find them all.\r\n\r\nso i change my mind to isolation metric registry. the current ut will register metric in different metric registry.\r\nand only generate metric in that registry. i think this will finally fix the flaky test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n1. support metric registry isolation.\r\n2. get metric in different generator method.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the

test for bucket based delayed message tracker, we found some error logs: `Error while updating ledger cursor` this is due to concurrent update cursor property lead to data race, although we have already used the retry mechanism, I think we can make the update operation linearly to reduce data competition.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nMake cursor property update linear execution, avoid data races cause operate failures.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is

#19771 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThis is the primary PR for PIP 257 (#19771). It adds an OpenID Conenct `AuthenticationProvider` implementation. The implementation is intended to be compliant with the OpenID Specs defined here: https://openid.net/developers/specs/. We specifically implement the discovery and these two:\r\n\r\n> * [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) – Defines the core OpenID Connect functionality: authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use of claims to communicate information about the End-User\r\n> * [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) – Defines how clients dynamically discover information about OpenID Providers\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Add new module `pulsar-broker-auth-oidc`\r\n* Add implementation that relies on auth0 client libraries to verify the signature and claims of the JWT\r\n* Use async http client for all http requests\r\n* Cache the provider metadata and the JWKS results\r\n* Support different types of `FallbackDiscoveryMode`s, as documented in the code. Essentially, this setting allows users to more easily integrate with k8s. We need this coupling with kubernetes to deal with some of the nuances of the k8s implementation. Note that this part of the code is experimental and is subject to change as requirements and cloud provider implementations change. One important reason we use the k8s client is because the API Server requires special configuration for authentication and TLS. Since these do not appear to be generic requirements, the K8s client simplifies this integration. Here is a reference to the decision that requires authentication by default for getting OIDC info https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80724. That discussion also indicate to me that this is an isolated design decision in k8s. If we find that authentication is a generic requirement, we should easily be able to expand the existing feature at a later time.\r\n* Add metrics to help quantify success and failure. (I had thought I would add audit logging, but that is an independent feature that we can add to the Pulsar framework. It seems outside the scope of an Authentication Provider implementation to implement this feature.)\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThere are many new tests to cover this new implementation.

to: #19455 #19830\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen I added the requirement for the proxy to use a role in the `proxyRoles` set, I didn't add a test that checked the negative case. This new test was first added in #19830 with one small difference. The goal of this test is to ensure that authorization of the client role and the original role is handled correctly.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Add new test class named `AuthorizationServiceTest`. We use `pass.proxy` and `fail.proxy` as proxy roles to simulate cases where the proxy's role passes and fails authorization, which is always possible.\r\n* Add new mock authorization provider named `MockAuthorizationProvider`. The logic is to let any role that starts with `pass` be considered authorized.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a new test.

Contribution Checklist\r\n  \r\n  - PR title format should be *[type][component] summary*. For details, see *[Guideline - Pulsar PR Naming Convention](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/)*. \r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Either this PR fixes an issue, -->\r\n\r\nFixes #19838\r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/wiki/proposals/PIP.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\n- flaky test : PulsarStandaloneTest.testMetadataInitialization. Test failure can only be observed if test-suit is running on machine/VM where nic speed is not set and PulsarService starts with broker conf where 'loadBalancerOverrideBrokerNicSpeedGbps' value is not set. \r\n- Pulsar CI Github action is running on VM where nic speed is set and test run is able to read nic speed of a VM where test-suite is running.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain here the context, and why you're making that change.

#18149\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe method `TopicName.getPartition(int index)` has a bug which misidentifies \"tp-partition-0-DLQ-partition-0\" as \"tp-partition-0-DLQ\".\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nFix the wrong logic of the method `TopicName.getPartition(int index)`\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### <strong>(Highlight) Note:</strong> New versions containing this patch cannot be upgraded smoothly\r\n\r\n#### 1. If users use the feature DLQ and enable topic auto-creation, the DLQ will be auto-created. For example: \r\n```java\r\nConsumer<String> consumer = pulsarClient.newConsumer(Schema.STRING)\r\n                .topic(\"primary-tp-partition-0\")\r\n                .subscriptionName(\"sub1\")\r\n                .enableRetry(true)\r\n                .subscribe();\r\n```\r\nThese two topics will be auto-created:\r\n- `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY`\r\n\r\n#### 2. And if users set the rule of the topic auto-creation like this:\r\n```\r\nallowAutoTopicCreationType=partitioned\r\ndefaultNumPartitions=2\r\n```\r\nThen will create two partitioned topics will be created:\r\n- `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY`\r\n  - `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY-partition-0`\r\n  - `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY-partition-1` \r\n\r\n#### 3. <strong>(Highlight)</strong>And if hit current issue: \r\nThen will create two partitioned topics will be created:\r\n- `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY`\r\n  - `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY`\r\n\r\nJust show an example:\r\n- there has a partitioned topic named `primary-tp.`\r\n- so there will have a partition named `primary-tp-partition-0.`\r\n- if enabled the feature DLQ, we get DLQ `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-DLQ.`\r\n- and if the DLQ is a partitioned topic, we get two partitions: `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-DLQ-partition-0` and `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-DLQ-partition-1`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### 4. What happens when you hit the issue and upgrade to the new version\r\nThere have retry topics as section-3 before the upgrade, and consumers consume messages from the topic `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY`.\r\n\r\nThese two partitions below will be created, and consumers will consume messages from these two topics below\r\n  - `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY-partition-0`\r\n  - `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY-partition-1` \r\n\r\nBut the messages in the original topic `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY` will not be consumed anymore. It seems some messages were lost.\r\n\r\n#### 5. Workaround\r\nDelete the ZK node `primary-tp-partition-0-sub1-RETRY` before the upgrade. Pulsar considers this topic to be non-partitioned, then the partitions will not be created after the upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf users hits the current issue before\r\n- there is a partitioned topic named \r\n\r\nthen the partition of the DLQ whose named `*-partition-*-partition-*` hits this issue.\r\n\r\n#### 6. <strong>(Highlight)</strong> Whether need a multi-partition DLQ/Retry Topic\r\nSee PIP 263:\r\n- Email: https://lists.apache.org/thread/tp25lom2ggztljlo76krsldo270f293j\r\n- https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/20033\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\nThis PR is following up #19230\r\n\r\nAs @yuruguo mentioned https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19230#issuecomment-1382865057, we can tighten the validation scope.\r\n\r\nI've checked the logic and found we have no way to create the partition topic with the `-partition-{index}` template. So we can righten the validation scope.\r\n\r\nI will keep working on the partition topic section and try to clarify the concept and logic. Plus, ensuring compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- tighten the validation scope\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 246c2701e5c43e02e9783c82d4d107d06b019951)\r\n\r\n- [x] `doc-not-needed`

Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is an inconsistency between sinks and sources. Sinks can be created by passing the whole config in the sinkConfig file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sinks create --sink-config-file <file-name>.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut Sources cannot. If we do the equivalent:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sources create --source-config-file <file-name>.yaml\r\n>Source archive not specified\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make it work, we currently have to explicitly pass in the type parameter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/pulsar-admin sources create --source-config-file <file-name>.yaml --source-type foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd the `sourceType` to `SourceConfig` so it can be passed through the config file too.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- extended `TestCmdSources`\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation & Modifications\r\n\r\nAs [discussed](https://lists.apache.org/thread/jpbnc1p2vsmlx81t0fllsk3fp84od5ny) in the mailing list, the PIP issue template has several drawbacks. I'm now quoting the opening mail in the thread.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest two changes I'd like to make to the PIP design template:\r\n1. Remove the form - just have a markdown template fill the issue body as it is created.\r\n2. Change the PIP template structure\r\n\r\n== Removing the form\r\n\r\nToday, when you want to submit a PIP, you are required to fill out a form with boxes composed of 3-4 lines length. \r\nIt's not good because:\r\n* It broadcasts to the author: we want a very small PIP, something that fits those small boxes.\r\n* It makes the PIP look like a bug, where you fill out fields.\r\n* It doesn't allow having H2 headings, only H1 headings, thus limiting the structure.\r\n\r\nA PIP is a design, essentially, something 1–3 pages long. Thus, people take the time to write it down. Preferably, they copy and paste the body of the PIP issue, and use it to fill in sections. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to define an issue template using only Markdown, without a form.\r\n\r\n== Changing PIP Structure\r\n\r\nToday the structure of the PIP doc (pasted below), is missing a section and generally aims to jump directly into API changes / code / implementation. This results in lots of back and forth emails in an attempt to get the following essentials:\r\n* All required background knowledge to understand the proposal\r\n* A high level overview of the proposed solution\r\n* Understanding how this proposal will be monitored \r\n* What steps exactly I need to take if I revert to the previous version.\r\n\r\nThe structure I propose in this PR aims to reduce that friction and get all PIP aligned to provide that information.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn #19455, I made a change to require that only a role in the broker's `proxyRoles` configuration could provide an original principal. Because this change can break certain installations on patch upgrades, a better temporary solution is to always authorize the `originalPrincipal` when present and to allow non proxy roles to supply the original principal.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Update the `AuthorizationService#isValidOriginalPrincipal` to allow non proxy roles to supply an original principal. I added a log line in place of the previous failure.\r\n* Update all calls to `ServiceConfiguration#getProxyRoles()` to also check if the original principal is not blank. When it is not blank, we will authorize both roles. Note that this is consistent with the logic in the `AuthorizationService#isValidOriginalPrincipal` method that is already merged to master.\r\n* Update tests to allow for this new behavior.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI modified existing tests to make this work, and I added a new test to cover mos of the relevant cases where we changed logic.\r\n\r\nI plan to copy the new tests to master since they will be valuable there too.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] `doc-required`\r\n\r\nI will follow up with docs for these proxy changes.\r\n\r\n### Matching PR in forked repository\r\n\r\nPR in forked repository: in order to save time, we'll run tests directly in the pulsar repo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-16T05:49:01Z","updated_at":"2023-04-01T06:23:29Z","closed_at":"2023-03-17T14:57:49Z","merged_at":"2023-03-17T14:57:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"6bc3530628344570cbd9171485e0478c6f01eab4","assignee":{"login":"michaeljmarshall","id":47911938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTExOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47911938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall","html_url":"https://github.com/michaeljmarshall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"michaeljmarshall","id":47911938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTExOTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47911938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall","html_url":"https://github.com/michaeljmarshall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaeljmarshall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"lhotari","id":66864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari","html_url":"https://github.com/lhotari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhotari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978303574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzgzMDM1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/area/broker","name":"area/broker","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1786669572,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzg2NjY5NTcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/doc-required","name":"doc-required","color":"db115e","default":false,"description":"Your

Motivation\r\n\r\nIf we enable batch message, sometimes we need to get the exact message in a batch or get the whole batch messages to help find out some problems.  But now the admin getMessageById() method can only get the first message in a batch. \r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n1. implement getBatchMessagesById() to get the whole batch messages in a entry\r\n2. implement get the exact batch message in the getMessageById() methods, and ensure the compatibility with previous behaviour\r\n3. add unittest for these implementation\r\n\r\n### Verifying

Motivation\r\nIf the same cursor is deleted concurrently due to multiple tasks, it will return a failure even if the deletion succeeded. Such a task has these: \r\n- cancel geo-replication will trigger the delete operation of the cursor `rep.x`\r\n- cancel the dedup task will trigger the delete operation of the cursor `dedup`\r\n- unsubscribe\r\n- delete topic\r\n\r\nIf the task `delete topic` and the above three tasks are concurrently executing, it will fail.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nWhen deleting the zk node of the cursor, if exception `MetadataStoreException.NotFoundException`  occurs, the deletion is considered successful\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

new Debezium DB2 source connector to pulsar-io and includes integration tests. \r\nFixes #7837\r\n\r\n**Motivation:**\r\nGetting data from IBM DB2 into Pulsar\r\n\r\n- [ ] `doc`\r\n- [ ] `doc-required`\r\n- [ ] `doc-not-needed`\r\n- [x] `doc-complete` \r\n\r\nDocs at https://github.com/apache/pulsar-site/pull/494\r\n\r\n**Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:**\r\n- [ ] `Dependencies (add or upgrade a dependency)`\r\n- [ ] `The public API`\r\n- [ ] `The schema`\r\n- [ ] `The default values of configurations`\r\n- [ ] `The threading model`\r\n- [ ] `The binary protocol`\r\n- [ ] `The REST endpoints`\r\n- [ ] `The admin CLI options`\r\n- [ ] `The metrics`\r\n- [ ] `Anything that affects deployment`\r\n- [x] `Build process`\r\n\r\nThe biggest change was that we needed to include building a Docker image in the build process for testing the DB2 connector since Debezium hasn't published an actual image with the necessary files. I verified that the DB2 license permits use of these drivers for testing purposes. More details in comments below (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19821#discussion_r1153696673 and https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19821#discussion_r1153721359). \r\n\r\nThe new Dockerfile was added to `tests/docker-images/debezium-db2-test-image` and was scoped as part of the `integrationTests` profile. \r\n\r\nTested against DB2 v11.5\r\n\r\n**Matching PR in forked

Motivation\r\n\r\nThe test `LockManagerTest.updateValueWhenKeyDisappears()` can having infrequent failures, especially when running with Etcd backend. \r\n\r\nThe problem is really in the logic of the `ResourceLock` itself. After a normal lock-acquire operation, the test is triggering 2 events at the same time: \r\n 1. A deletion of the lock key-value (eg: the ephemeral node might have disappeared)\r\n 2. A `lock.update()` operation to change the value of the lock.\r\n\r\nThe race condition is due to the fact that operation (1) will trigger a lock revalidation in background and this now happens at the same time as operation (2). \r\n\r\nThe result is that it's possible for the ResourceLock to enter into a loop of revalidations and deletions.\r\n\r\neg: \r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-03-14T20:40:40,350 -

Motivation\r\nThere may be multiple commit requests arriving to brokers, but lines 385 to 388 in `org.apache.pulsar.transaction.coordinator.impl.MLTransactionMetadataStore` can't avoid race condition.\r\n```\r\n                if (txnMetaListPair.getLeft().status() == newStatus) {\r\n                    promise.complete(null);\r\n                    return promise;\r\n                }\r\n```\r\nTwo request may pass the check and try to update the transaction state, which will throw exceptions like `Expect Txn (7,24726) to be in COMMITTING status but it is in COMMITTED status`.

Issue: #19814\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen server try to dispatch message in PersistentDispatcherMultipleConsumers, if consumer restart, the entries may skip filterEntriesForConsumer() and directly go to \"No consumers found with available permits, storing {} positions for later replay\".\r\n\r\nThen when consumer replay entries, the entries would also skip filterEntriesForConsumer(), so the aborted txn message would not be filtered.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nalso filter the aborted txn message in filterEntriesForConsumer() when readType is replay\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this

build in apache/pulsar will fail and instructions will\r\nbe provided for opening a PR in the PR author's forked repository.\r\n\r\napache/pulsar pull requests should be first tested in your own fork since the \r\napache/pulsar CI based on GitHub Actions has constrained resources and quota.\r\nGitHub Actions provides separate quota for pull requests that are executed in \r\na forked repository.\r\n\r\nThe tests will be run in the forked repository until all PR review comments have\r\nbeen handled, the tests pass and the PR is approved by a reviewer.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-15T01:37:20Z","updated_at":"2024-04-02T17:44:31Z","closed_at":"2023-03-29T09:30:25Z","merged_at":"2023-03-29T09:30:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"ee5ac8607ebd7f90843789d4eead48de8600c1f0","assignee":{"login":"heesung-sn","id":103456639,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiqffw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103456639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn","html_url":"https://github.com/heesung-sn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"heesung-sn","id":103456639,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiqffw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103456639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn","html_url":"https://github.com/heesung-sn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heesung-sn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":399568951,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzOTk1Njg5NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/pulsar/labels/type/enhancement","name":"type/enhancement","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":"The

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn NonPersistentTopic, we dispatch messages to Consumers by using\r\n```\r\n               subscription.getDispatcher().sendMessages(Collections.singletonList(entry));\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut Collections.SingleList.class didn't override `void set(int i, T element)` method,\r\nit extends `void set(int i, T element)` from AbstractList, and AbstractList.set(int i, T element)\r\nthrows `UnsupportedException`.\r\n\r\nSo the following usage will lead to `UnsupportedException`:\r\n```\r\nList<Object> objs = Collections.singletonList(new Object());\r\nobjs.set(0, null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in [AbstractBaseDispatcher#filterEntriesForConsumer](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/AbstractBaseDispatcher.java#L153), if the filter result is REJECT/RESCHEDULE, it will filter out the entry by calling \r\n```\r\nentries.set(i, null);\r\n```\r\nand it will throw `UnsupportedException`, the exception will caught by [ServerCnx#exceptionCaught](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/service/ServerCnx.java#L387).\r\n\r\nThe producer will be closed and try to reconnect.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the modifications you've done. -->\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI

#16763  \r\n\r\n<!-- Details of when a PIP is required and how the PIP process work, please see: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/master/wiki/proposals/PIP.md -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn #14740, we clean the delayed message tracker when all consumer disconnect to avoid adding duplicated messages,\r\nbut BucketDelayedDeliveryTracker uses bitmap to avoid adding duplicated messages. So we don't clean up BucketDelayedDeliveryTracker, otherwise we will lose the bucket snapshot.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n* Don't clean up BucketDelayedDeliveryTracker when all consumer disconnect\r\n* Clear missing lastMutableBucketQueue when clear lastMutableBucket\r\n* Fix NPE when clear snapshot\r\n* Add test\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

detailed improvement instructions, please refer to issues：\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/18056\r\n\r\noriginal PR：\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/18116\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nCurrently, pulsar does not statistics broker level metrics, and all relevant metrics are 0 by default.\r\n\r\nWhen the number of topic partitions reaches more than 100000 or even millions, and the topic level metrics are exposed (exposeTopicLevelMetricsInPrometheus=true), if you want to query the metrics of the broker dimension, you need to summarize all topics, and the performance becomes very poor, or even the results cannot be queried from the promethus. Common broker level metrics include:\r\n```\r\npulsar_topics_count\r\npulsar_subscriptions_count\r\npulsar_producers_count\r\npulsar_consumers_count\r\npulsar_rate_in\r\npulsar_rate_out\r\npulsar_throughput_in\r\npulsar_throughput_out\r\npulsar_storage_size\r\npulsar_storage_logical_size\r\npulsar_storage_write_rate\r\npulsar_storage_read_rate\r\npulsar_msg_backlog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\nWe need to statistics the metrics of the broker dimension and expose them to prometheus to improve the performance of the monitoring of the broker dimension. Modify the original metrics name as follows:\r\n```\r\npulsar_broker_topics_count\r\npulsar_broker_subscriptions_count\r\npulsar_broker_producers_count\r\npulsar_broker_consumers_count\r\npulsar_broker_rate_in\r\npulsar_broker_rate_out\r\npulsar_broker_throughput_in\r\npulsar_broker_throughput_out\r\npulsar_broker_storage_size\r\npulsar_broker_storage_logical_size\r\npulsar_broker_storage_write_rate\r\npulsar_broker_storage_read_rate\r\npulsar_broker_msg_backlog\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

Motivation\r\n\r\nManagedLedgerImpl retains eagerly a cache of all the BookKeeper ReadHandles.\r\nIn case of Offloaded ReadHandler there is kind of a memory leak, as each BlobStoreBackedInputStreamImpl retains a DirectBuffer of 1MB, in the case of a topic with terabytes of data and thousands of ledger this leads to Direct OOM errors if something tries to open all the ledgers\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdd a new  background activity that evicts from memory all the Offloaded ReadHandles and release memory.\r\n\r\nThe feature is controlled by the new configuration option managedLedgerInactiveOffloadedLedgerEvictionTimeSeconds=600\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this fix cannot fully prevent a OODM error because there is no global count and limit of the memory retained by such Handles, it allows to mitigate the problem by releasing automatically unused Ledger Handlers.\r\nThe default value, 10 minutes, is very conservative, but it should work with real-world ledgers.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario is a topic with tens of thousands of small ledgers with a consumer that reads from the topic from the beginning, in this case the broker will open the ReadHandlers probably more quickly than the eviction process pace.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/issues/18112\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nIn the `RetentionPolicies`, the type of the `retentionSizeInMB` field does not match that of the `retentionSizeInMB` type from the `constructor`.\r\n\r\nA simple solution is to fix the constructor, `long` can be compatible with `int`, so just use the `long`.\r\n\r\nIn #18114, the type of the `retentionSizeInMB` field was changed to `int`, I don't think this is correct, and it introduces a bug: https://github.com/apache/pulsar/blob/75d58fda2fe99471abddc60f7ed671aaa6073e66/pulsar-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/pulsar/broker/admin/AdminResource.java#L381-L382\r\n\r\n `retention.getRetentionSizeInMB() * 1024 * 1024` can be overflowing, and then the result is 0.\r\n\r\nPlease use the following code to verify that:\r\n```java\r\nint retentionSize = 102400; // 12G\r\nvar n = (retentionSize * 1024 * 1024);\r\nSystem.out.println(n == 0); // true\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Revert #18114\r\n- Change the `retentionSizeInMB` type to `long` in the `constructor`\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION. CHECK THE PROPER BOX ONLY. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] `doc` <!-- Your PR contains doc changes. -->\r\n- [ ] `doc-required` <!-- Your PR changes impact docs and you will update later -->\r\n- [x]

Motivation\r\n\r\nKCA's SourceConnector uses Kafka's task name as a parameter and creates the task directly.\r\nthis works well enough for simpler or old sources (e.g. debezium's postgre/mysql/mongo etc).\r\nActual expected life cycle is to create a connector, then get the task class and the task config from it.\r\nConnectors that rely on such cycle do not work with KCA, e.g. yugabyte's debezium source. See \r\nhttps://apache-pulsar.slack.com/archives/C5Z4T36F7/p1677506713032549 for details.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nAdded option to pass source connector's class name, made use of it.\r\nKept the KCA compatible with old configuration, falling back to the legacy behavior if the config is not set.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added unit test.\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

#11032 \r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Issue: #11032 \r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nDue to the session timeout time being too small, it will cause the scheduler to be in busy loop status and give no chance for other threads(`process method`) to get the synchronous lock. \r\nThis behaviour may affect the notification order and make the test fail.\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Use `scheduleWithFixedDelay` to avoid a busy loop.\r\n- Make the test get out of quarantine.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO

https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/19754\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nThis is a namespace bundle double-owners problem. We found it in the memory dumps.\r\n\r\nThe memory dumps show that the notification thread has been blocked for a long time by the leader election deadlock, And many notifications are blocked in the executor queue. This causes we can't to revalidate the locks, and they are still thinking them working well.\r\n\r\nFor private reasons, I can't share the namespace bundle snapshot, but the blocked thread easily explains it.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1061\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74767115/223670419-c4319f44-f1e1-4361-8c79-04c7f0dabe3c.png\"> ^^ blocked thread\r\n\r\n<img width=\"949\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74767115/223672000-fb4ce22c-6a45-4cb6-9d23-c36e3afbc93a.png\">\r\n\r\n^^ executor queue\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\n- Avoid putting the new task to single thread executor causes deadlock.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit cbd799f05eb26aeac5ffd5bbb9751ad9e5928dd3)\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (10MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after broker failure*\r\n\r\n### Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION.

Motivation\r\n1. There is a topic1 with a protobuf schema.\r\n2. Create a producer1 with AutoProduceBytes schema.\r\n3. The producer1 will be created failed because the way to get the schema of protobuf schema is not supported. ### ### \r\n### Modification\r\nBecause the Protobuf schema is implemented from the AvroBaseStructSchema.

do upgrade `dependency-check-maven` to version `8.1.2`.\r\n- [CVE 2020 26939](https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/wiki/CVE-2020-26939): make the version of project BC unify into `1.69`\r\n- [CVE-2021-28170](https://github.com/jakartaee/expression-language/pull/160) remove lib `javax.el`\r\n- [CVE-2022-34917] & [CVE-2023-25194] is a wrong report, It seems to treat `pulsar-io-kafka-connect-adaptor` as a lib of Kafka, so remove these two checks\r\n```\r\npulsar-io-kafka-connect-adaptor-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
