This class contains an instance final field that is initialized to a compile-time static value. Consider making the field static.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nDescribe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's\r\nnot necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence.\r\n\r\nDescribe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIf there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For\r\nexample:\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such\r\n   as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point\r\nand compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the\r\nadvantages of the chosen designs and names.\r\n\r\nIf there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any\r\nother issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain\r\nwhat have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the\r\ndiscussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those\r\naspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description.\r\n\r\nSome of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nCheck the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the\r\nitems which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist above are strictly necessary,\r\nbut it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the key changed/added classes

#XXXX.\r\n\r\n(Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove the above line if there is no corresponding\r\nissue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request.)\r\n\r\n(If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers.)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDescribe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's\r\nnot necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence.\r\n\r\nDescribe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIf there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For\r\nexample:\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such\r\n   as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point\r\nand compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the\r\nadvantages of the chosen designs and names.\r\n\r\nIf there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any\r\nother issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain\r\nwhat have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the\r\ndiscussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those\r\naspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description.\r\n\r\nSome of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nCheck the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the\r\nitems which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist above are strictly necessary,\r\nbut it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the key changed/added classes in this PR are `MyFoo`, `OurBar`, and `TheirBaz`.\r\n\r\n(Add this section in big PRs to ease navigation in them for

Description\r\nThis PR modifies `SqlFirehose` to be a bit more forgiving, by always constructing a `MapInputRowParser` from `InputRowParser.getParseSpec`, ensuring that a map parser is used to parse the `Map<String, Object>` produced from the sql result iterator. \r\n\r\nIt also updates the firehose documentation to specify the type of parsers that various firehose implementations support and also lightly elaborates on parser types in general ingestion docs.\r\n\r\nFinally, it adds mention of and example ingestion specs for sql firehoses in the mysql and postgresql extension

check style check that static final field names are all uppercase\r\n\r\nFixes #6855.\r\n\r\n(Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove the above line if there is no corresponding\r\nissue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request.)\r\n\r\n(If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers.)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDescribe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's\r\nnot necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence.\r\n\r\nDescribe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIf there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For\r\nexample:\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such\r\n   as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point\r\nand compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the\r\nadvantages of the chosen designs and names.\r\n\r\nIf there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any\r\nother issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain\r\nwhat have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the\r\ndiscussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those\r\naspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description.\r\n\r\nSome of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nCheck the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the\r\nitems which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist above are strictly necessary,\r\nbut it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the key changed/added classes

Description\r\nThis PR follows up on the changes in #8014, which actually opened the door to using the same optimized selector to evaluate single input column expressions for multi-value string columns, using native Druid behavior to do the `map` of the expression across the values. This works provided a few conditions are met: \r\n* the expression _does not_ operate on the multi-value input as an array\r\n* the expression _does not_ produce an array\r\n* the single multi-value column is used _at most once_ in the expression\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, functions and apply functions now also report if they have array inputs or outputs which is collected on `Expr.BindingDetails`, which is already used to analyze the expression in `ExpressionSelectors` in order to determine the correct type of selector to create.\r\n\r\nThis change also allows multi-value expressions that meet the above conditions to work with group by v1, since the cardinality can be known, however wider multi-value expression support for group by v1 is not available (or really my priority).\r\n\r\nThis PR has also uncovered some inconsistencies in the null value handling for multi-value expressions, [specifically the part that coerces `null`, `[]`, and `[null]` all into `[null]`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/virtual/ExpressionSelectors.java#L446), which creates some minor differences between using the `SingleStringInputDimensionSelector` to \"map\" an expression across the row values compared to using a `map` expression. Ideally I will modify the coercion to not convert `[]` to `[null]`, which seems to be the problematic issue, but it creates mass of failing tests in the `ExpressionFilterTest` due to differences in behavior in the underlying selectors, so I intend to investigate this deeper in follow-up work The difference in behavior is apparent in the modified calcite test, where `[]` is grouped as null with default null handling behavior instead of `\"\"`. This is likely related or at least similar to #5897 and #4915.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-09T20:10:17Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T20:22:20Z","closed_at":"2019-08-02T20:21:26Z","merged_at":"2019-08-02T20:21:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"e7c6deac768d66c12b71daecae12ecb5a7db2380","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI've analysed your code base and noticed that `org.apache.druid.extendedset.intset.ConciseSetUtils` in the `extendedset` module is not fully tested.\r\n\r\nI've written some tests that cover this class with the help of [Diffblue Cover](https://www.diffblue.com/opensource).\r\n\r\nHopefully, these tests should help you detect any regressions caused by future code changes. If you would find it useful to have additional tests written for this repository, I would be more than happy to look at other particular classes that you consider important.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR

proposal for #7641.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nMaking optimal usage of multiple segment cache locations to distribute segments. See #7641 for more details.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Algorithm\r\n1. **Round-robin algorithm**: The algorithm selects segment cache locations in a round-robin fashion to distribute the segments. This I believe has a nice property that the writes are distributed evenly across the available drives/locations (with enough availability) there by improving the I/O throughput. \r\n\r\n### Alternative Algorithms Considered\r\nThe following alternative algorithms have been discussed. \r\n\r\n1. **Least bytes used algorithm** (or least filled disk) approach: This algorithm picks a location with the least bytes used. This to me seems reasonable in most cases. See https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8038#issuecomment-510214132. In practice the distribution of segment sizes are not very even for several reasons (an interval having less or more data, improperly tuned cluster etc). For example, segments sizes across intervals could be any where from 100MB to 1GB assuming most intervals with very close segment sizes, few intervals having outliers like say 100MB or 1GB.  Let us consider we have 3 locations. If a location (location 1) loads a segment of size 1GB, the subsequent calls to load segments of lesser sizes will be distributed between locations 2 and 3 until both of them reach/cross 1 GB. This repeats every time a particular location loads a bigger size segment. This might not have optimal write throughput in such a scenario. However, I'm not sure how much of a problem is this.\r\n\r\n2. **Max free size algorithm**: Choose the segment cache location with the max free size each time. This algorithm has a possible short coming as explained in https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8038#discussion_r301140082.\r\n\r\n#### New configuration\r\nThis PR introduces an optional new Historical runtime property **druid.segmentCache.locationSelectorStrategy** to make the segment cache location selection strategy configurable. Possible values for the above property - round-robin, least-bytes-used.\r\n\r\n#### Test plan\r\nUnit tests to be added. \r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\nDocumentation needs to be updated with the new property if the location selection strategy is made configurable and release notes for the same.

#XXXX.\r\n\r\n(Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove the above line if there is no corresponding\r\nissue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request.)\r\n\r\n(If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers.)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDescribe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's\r\nnot necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence.\r\n\r\nDescribe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIf there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For\r\nexample:\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such\r\n   as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point\r\nand compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the\r\nadvantages of the chosen designs and names.\r\n\r\nIf there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any\r\nother issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain\r\nwhat have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the\r\ndiscussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those\r\naspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description.\r\n\r\nSome of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nCheck the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the\r\nitems which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist above are strictly necessary,\r\nbut it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the key changed/added classes in this PR are `MyFoo`, `OurBar`, and `TheirBaz`.\r\n\r\n(Add this section in big PRs to ease navigation in them for

#6786 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRouter does not perform any authorization checks and depends on requests forwarded to other nodes to perform authorization and set `DRUID_AUTHORIZATION_CHECKED` header. It works fine in most cases, however for requests that are not forwarded to other nodes and are not in unsecured path list, this header is not set, thus `PreResponseAuthorizationCheckFilter` throws exception. Example of this would be `/druid/router/v1/brokers` end point on router.\r\n\r\nTo fix this added appropriate resource filter to router

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with the automatic translation of expressions for multi-value string column inputs, where if an identifier was duplicated, the expression would not transform correctly.\r\n\r\nThis has been resolved by modifying expression parsing to uniquely identify all _non lambda bound_ `IdentifierExpr`, at parsing transformation time in `ExprListenerImpl`. `LambdaExpr` identifiers are marked on entering a lambda expression, and all non-lambda identifiers are given a unique identifier to accompany the identifier to use to get the value from the `Expr.ObjectBinding`.\r\n\r\n`Expr.BindingDetails` has been reworked to accommodate this change, as well as simplified. Further refactoring took place in `Parser` to handle the transformation required to create `LambdaExpr` binding `IdentifierExpr` to ensure the correct transformation.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nbefore patch:\r\n```\r\nconcat(x, '-lol-', x)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nwhere `x` is a multi-value string dimension would result in a transformation to something like \r\n\r\n```\r\nmap((x) -> concat(x, '-lol-', x), x)\r\n```\r\n \r\nafter patch:\r\nthis will correctly map to something like \r\n```\r\ncartesian_map((x, x_0) -> concat(x, '-lol-', x_0), x, x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader. \r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's\r\nnot necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence.\r\n\r\nDescribe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIf there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such\r\n   as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point\r\nand compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the\r\nadvantages of the chosen designs and names.\r\n\r\nIf there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any\r\nother issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain\r\nwhat have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the\r\ndiscussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those\r\naspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description.\r\n\r\nSome of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.-->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](\r\n   https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR\r\n   doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's\r\nnot necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence.\r\n\r\nDescribe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIf there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For\r\nexample:\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such\r\n   as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point\r\nand compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the\r\nadvantages of the chosen designs and names.\r\n\r\nIf there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any\r\nother issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain\r\nwhat have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the\r\ndiscussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those\r\naspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description.\r\n\r\nSome of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](\r\n   https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR\r\n   doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nEnables the `WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR` code smell in Spotbugs. Also refactored some code by using the new Lambda style, which is more readable.\r\n\r\nDescribe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIf there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For\r\nexample:\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such\r\n   as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point\r\nand compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the\r\nadvantages of the chosen designs and names.\r\n\r\nIf there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any\r\nother issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain\r\nwhat have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the\r\ndiscussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those\r\naspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description.\r\n\r\nSome of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar\r\nreader. \r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nCheck the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the\r\nitems which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist above are strictly necessary,\r\nbut it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the key changed/added classes in this PR are `MyFoo`, `OurBar`, and `TheirBaz`.\r\n\r\n(Add this section in big PRs to ease navigation in them for reviewers.)","created_at":"2019-07-01T22:15:40Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T21:55:13Z","closed_at":"2019-07-30T16:51:54Z","merged_at":"2019-07-30T16:51:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"e016995d1fb6085a48e2e0d0a28504ed955f0293","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1169814386,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTY5ODE0Mzg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Automation/Static%20Analysis","name":"Area

The way we do now is\r\n\r\n1) Generating dependency reports using maven and npm\r\n2) Compare the licenses in LICENSE.BINARY against generated reports\r\n3) Fix LICENSE.BINARY if something is wrong\r\n\r\nThis is a huge burden for the release manager since we have tons of binary dependency. We should automate this check.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a binary license management system. All binary licenses are maintained in `license.yaml` file. Here is a snippet of the file.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nname: modified portions of the Guava library\r\nlicense_category: source\r\nlicense_name: Apache License version 2.0\r\nmodule: java-core\r\ncopyright: The Guava Authors (https://github.com/google/guava)\r\nsource_paths:\r\n  - Closer class: core/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/java/util/common/io/Closer.java\r\n  - Splitter.splitToList() method: core/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/java/util/common/parsers/DelimitedParser.java\r\n  - DirectExecutorService class: core/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/java/util/common/concurrent/DirectExecutorService.java\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nname: Checker Qual\r\nlicense_category: binary\r\nmodule: java-core\r\nlicense_name: MIT License\r\nversion: 2.5.7\r\ncopyright: the Checker Framework developers\r\nlicense_file_path: licenses/bin/checker-qual.MIT\r\nlibraries:\r\n  - org.checkerframework: checker-qual\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `skip_dependency_report_check` is set to true for some licenses. For `FindBugs JSR305`, it's set to true since maven dependency plugin reports a wrong license (LGPL). Note that `FindBugs` is licensed under LGPL but `JSR305` is licensed under [BSD-3 license](https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/blob/2.0.1/findbugs/licenses/LICENSE-jsr305.txt). This script also skips dependency report check for `\"Java Concurrency In Practice\" Book Annotations` since it points to a book and doesn't have a valid library version.\r\n\r\n`docs/_bin/generate-license.py` reads this file, checks the registered licenses with maven dependency report, and generates the contents of `LICENSE.BINARY` file. You can run this program as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ docs/_bin/generate-license-dependency-reports.py /path/to/druid/source/code /path/to/root/of/license-reports/\r\n$ docs/_bin/generate-license.py licenses/APACHE2 license.yaml /path/to/root/of/license-reports/ LICENSE.BINARY\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated `LICENSE.BINARY` file is a little bit different from the current one, mostly because of the difficulty of auto generation.\r\n\r\n~I will adjust `distribution/pom.xml` to generate LICENSE.BINARY when building binary distribution in a follow-up PR. I will also set up Travis to run license check automatically.~\r\nI have adjusted `distribution/pom.xml` to generate LICENSE.BINARY when building binary distribution. This is currently being checked automatically in Travis.","created_at":"2019-06-29T23:45:35Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T21:38:57Z","closed_at":"2019-07-08T19:24:52Z","merged_at":"2019-07-08T19:24:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"12f12676e3fdb747807265ea909b94699f96bf02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":950723510,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NTA3MjM1MTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Apache","name":"Apache","color":"f7c6c7","default":false,"description":"Items

#XXXX.\r\n\r\n(Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove the above line if there is no corresponding\r\nissue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request.)\r\n\r\n(If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers.)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDescribe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's\r\nnot necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence.\r\n\r\nDescribe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem?\r\n\r\nIf there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For\r\nexample:\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such\r\n   as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n\r\nIt's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point\r\nand compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the\r\nadvantages of the chosen designs and names.\r\n\r\nIf there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any\r\nother issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain\r\nwhat have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the\r\ndiscussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those\r\naspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description.\r\n\r\nSome of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](\r\n   https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR\r\n   doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar\r\nreader. \r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nCheck the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the\r\nitems which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist above are strictly necessary,\r\nbut it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nFor reviewers: the key changed/added classes

goal of this PR is to create a document with principles that Druid developers should follow if they want to\r\n\r\n - Sustain long-term maintainability of the project.\r\n - Improve the project effectively.\r\n - Improve their own and fellow developers' skill. This will have positive second-order effects in the perspective of the previous two goals.\r\n - Minimize overhead associated with distributed, cross-organizational development.\r\n - Foster the atmosphere of trust and respect in the project development. This will have positive second-order effects in the perspective of all previous goals.\r\n\r\nThe currently proposed version of the document is synthesized mainly from the [Code review](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/a9801245e50dc9459af5972354089a427effcfbd720ab2ec2c3f9ee6@%3Cdev.druid.apache.org%3E) discussion in the mailing list and the [Druid PR review checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17EEKT6fih9Dd5NfXjBoECcKbVp1eOB2vb3jKqTF9pPc/edit) document (see the [discussion of this document in the mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/74ec4a52b8cef87129a12d7ee834deef39d8bdef7f049473d4c56058@%3Cdev.druid.apache.org%3E); note that this document is already partially moved into the repository as [committer's instructions](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md)).\r\n\r\nThe document has seven sections:\r\n\r\n 1. Diligence\r\n 2. Proactivity\r\n 3. Responsibility and leadership\r\n 4. Operational principles\r\n 5. Openness\r\n 6. Learning\r\n 7. Respect\r\n\r\nMany principles could potentially go into multiple sections, and I didn't pay too much attention to determining \"the best\" section for each principle. There is also considerable repetition between principles: most information is repeated 2-3 times in various forms in different principles, which is unavoidable and, I think, not bad.\r\n\r\nFollow [this link](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/fe5bb66aad5ba3ce808a7bf243a6ef24240d7507/dev/principles.md) to read the document in a formatted form rather than in raw markdown.\r\n\r\nOne of the basic ideas which I've put into the principles is extreme overcompensation: if either a PR author or a reviewer follows the principles then the effect will be mostly the same as if both of them follow the principles. See principle \"3.7. Always follow these principles no matter if other people do that\".\r\n\r\nOne thing that I haven't embed from the \"Code review\" thread linked above is @gianm's suggestion to create a list of PR blocker things. One reason is that I think that different PRs should have different blockers, which I discussed in principle \"1.9. Check that the work follows these principles and use checklists\". On the other hand, the document suggests PR authors treat all comments as obligatory (see principles \"2.7. Do everything \"optional\" that reviewers ask you to do\" and \"7.5. Respect reviewer's requests\") and reviewers consider most of their own comments as optional (see \"7.6. Treat your own review comments as optional when PR authors disagree with them\"), in the overcompensation manner. \r\n\r\nI've also included the principle about the minimum \"poking period\" of one week (see \"7.2. Don't \"ping\" people in PRs too often\") despite in the [discussion in the mailing list earlier](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c3e3cabe13851a3bd20e40a80a6b1eed80861a4fdb5c371d55d72d67@%3Cdev.druid.apache.org%3E) people pushed back and suggested much shorter periods. This is because I continue to genuinely believe that periods of less than one week are not sustainable. I think we need more diverse opinions on this topic (only I and employees of Imply have participated in the discussion of this particular topic so far).\r\n\r\nNote: this document is *not* a checklist for code reviews. The principles can be seen as a \"meta checklist\" for the development process and communication.\r\n\r\nAs I noted in the \"Code review\" discussion, the target audience of these principles are \"regular\" Druid contributors.\r\n\r\nFollowing the principles is voluntary: see \"7.1. Respect people's right not to follow these principles\". However, principles themselves demand to always follow them: \"3.7. Always follow these principles no matter if other people do that\", again, in the overcompensation style.\r\n\r\n@gianm @drcrallen @himanshug @b-slim @asdf2014 @julianhyde @egor-ryashin @pjain1 @fjy

#7959\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the behavior of `ComplexMetrics.registerSerde` to ensure that when a `ComplexMetricSerde` is already registered to a type string, that the existing type is the _expected_ type. This is done to confirm that the usages of complex type strings is a unique mapping to `ComplexMetricSerde` implementations, and triggering a failure otherwise. This is a change of the current behavior, which silently ignores registration when a `ComplexMetricSerde` is already registered to a type.\r\n\r\nThis is done mechanically by passing the class of the registered `ComplexMetricSerde` type into the registration function. Perhaps there is a more elegant way to do this?\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

PR continues the work laid out in #7525 and rounds out the remaining array function expressions not part of #7973, `array_length`, `array_offset`, `array_offset_of`, `array_ordinal`, `array_ordinal_of`, `array_append`, `array_prepend`, `array_concat`, `array_slice`, `array_to_string`, and `string_to_array`.\r\n\r\n`array_length`, `array_offset`, `array_offset_of`, `array_ordinal`, `array_ordinal_of`, and `array_to_string` are done as alias operator conversions, so both `MV_` and `ARRAY_` prefixed functions have been added to map the these druid expression functions. \r\n\r\n`array_append`, `array_prepend`, `array_concat`, `array_slice`, and `string_to_array` produce array typed outputs, so only the `MV_` prefix which produce an sql `VARCHAR` have been implemented at this time (we don't handle sql `ARRAY` type fully at planner level at this time).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR fixes a bug in `array_offset_of` and `array_ordinal_of` when `-Ddruid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=true` which would incorrectly translate a `null` response to `0` at the selector level. Instead, these functions will now return `-1` instead of `null` to not produce an incorrect answer.","created_at":"2019-06-27T01:41:21Z","updated_at":"2019-08-08T21:35:04Z","closed_at":"2019-07-03T04:39:27Z","merged_at":"2019-07-03T04:39:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"c556d44a19b6daac1bb9070ed7fe9325fd595545","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

PR continues the work laid out in #7525 and adds a new function, `array(expr1, ... ,exprN)`, to allow constructing expression arrays, as well as a corresponding druid-sql `ARRAY` function which does the same. These functions were both added in the service of adding sql functions that allow filtering multi-value dimensions as expressively as native Druid queries, `MV_CONTAINS` and `MV_OVERLAP`, where the `MV_` stands for 'multi-value'. \r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT dim3 FROM druid.numfoo WHERE MV_CONTAINS(dim3, ARRAY['a','b']) LIMIT 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've actually defined these as aliases for `ARRAY_CONTAINS` and `ARRAY_OVERLAP`, since both sets of these functions are driven internally by `array_contains` and `array_overlap` respectively, so they can share operator conversion implementations. So this is equivalent:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT dim3 FROM druid.numfoo WHERE ARRAY_CONTAINS(dim3, ARRAY['a','b']) LIMIT 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reasoning for the dupe naming is: most of the Druid expression array functions pose no problem with accepting either `VARCHAR` or `ARRAY` typed input, but the functions which _produce_ an array expression will need different implementations for differently typed outputs (`VARCHAR` for `MV_`, and `ARRAY` for `ARRAY_`), so this is done to encourage using the `MV_` prefix for multi-value string dimensions, and reserving `ARRAY_` for if/when we implement true array types natively in Druid. I have not documented any of the sql support for multi-value string dimensions yet, so there is still some wiggle room here as I continue to fill out the other functions.\r\n\r\nThe array constructor function also works for other column inputs or even expressions, so long as they are scalar valued. For example:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT dim3 FROM druid.numfoo WHERE MV_CONTAINS(dim3, ARRAY[dim1, CONCAT(dim2, 'hello')]) LIMIT 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould match rows where multi valued column `dim3` has both the value of `dim1` and the value of `dim2` with `'hello'` appended to it.\r\n\r\nIn the process of these changes, I've modified the output of `array_contains` and `array_overlap` expressions to return 1 or 0, instead of using `ExprEval.bestEffortOf` with a boolean input, which was ending up as `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`, which for `ExprEval` is never true. This allows these functions to actually work in
