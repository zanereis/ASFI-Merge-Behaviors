Adding support for KnoxSSO.\r\n\r\n**High Level Description**\r\nThis PR facilitates Apache Knox SSO. It can support both cases where the users directly access NiFi and simply use Knox SSO for authentication and where Knox is proxying access to NiFi. \r\n\r\nIn the direct access case when an unauthenticated user attempts to go to NiFi, NiFi will redirect the user to Knox log in. After successfully logging in, Knox will generate a JWT and put it in an HTTP Cookie and redirect back to NiFi. NiFi will consider the JWT and verify it by validating the signature, audience, and expiration. The signature is validated using a configured public key from Knox. Acceptable audiences can also be configured but are not required. If the JWT is validated, the user identity is extracted from the token.\r\n\r\nIn the proxying case when an unauthenticated user attempts to go to NiFi through Knox, Knox will redirect the user to Knox log in. After successfully logging in, Knox will generate a JWT and put it in an HTTP Cookie and redirect back to NiFi through Knox. If the requests from Knox to NiFi are made over two-way SSL the JWT in the HTTP Cookie is validated at Knox and the user identity will be placed in the proxied entities chain. When the requests from Knox to NiFi are made over one-way SSL, the Knox Cookie is relayed to the request to NiFi allowing NiFi to validate it with the same logic described above in the direct access case.\r\n\r\nFor the proxying case, the only new capabilities introduced here are also part of the direct access case (JWT token validation). Because of this, all of the capabilities should be able to be tested using direct NiFi access with Knox SSO.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nTo test Knox SSO when directly accessing NiFi, install both Knox and NiFi. Knox SSO configuration is described here [1]. In NiFi four new properties have been introduced:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#nifi properties example\r\nnifi.security.user.knox.url=https://localhost:8443/gateway/knoxsso/api/v1/websso\r\nnifi.security.user.knox.publicKey=<path-to>/gateway-identity.pem\r\nnifi.security.user.knox.cookieName=hadoop-jwt\r\nnifi.security.user.knox.audiences=\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese properties assume that Knox is running locally on 8443 and NiFi is secured and running on another port. The publicKey can be exported from Knox using the following command:\r\n\r\n`<knox-install-dir>/bin/knoxcli.sh export-cert`\r\n\r\nThe cookieName property would need to align with what is configured in Knox. The audience property is used to only accept tokens from a particular audience. The audience value is configured as part of Knox SSO [1].\r\n\r\n[1]

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added .displayName in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\nRegarding NOTICE and LICENSE related changes, I think I don't need to touch them but I am not sure. I added dropwizard-metrics dependency (which is under ASF2 license), so verify me here please.\r\n\r\nWell, I hope I didn't go too far here and that I utilized controller services and reporting tasks the way they were meant to be used. I figured out after looking at `AmbariReportingTask` and `DataDogReportingTask` that most of the code is very (very) similar, as is quite noticeable when looking at their implementation. What is different between them is not the metrics that are being reported, but rather the report method itself. I chose to implement a single, generic reporting task that will rely on different implementations of a service which will provide it with a reporter. I figured that is rather similar to the DB connection pool service conceptually.\r\nIf you think this is OK, I'd be more than happy to try and implement both the ambari and datadog reporting tasks the same way.\r\n\r\nThanks :)","created_at":"2017-09-24T19:34:23Z","updated_at":"2017-10-08T14:45:00Z","closed_at":"2017-10-08T14:45:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"748cb1555ad1f4e2e859deeb08483e56d58c0459","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/2171/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/2171/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2171/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/adce9e79f2fbeb1c00ef3e283eb728285eff0eda","head":{"label":"omerhadari:nifi-4392","ref":"nifi-4392","sha":"adce9e79f2fbeb1c00ef3e283eb728285eff0eda","user":{"login":"omerhadari","id":15015993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE1OTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15015993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari","html_url":"https://github.com/omerhadari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103743239,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDM3NDMyMzk=","name":"nifi","full_name":"omerhadari/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"omerhadari","id":15015993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDE1OTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15015993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari","html_url":"https://github.com/omerhadari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omerhadari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/omerhadari/nifi","description":"Mirror

JettyServer should confirm \"docs\" path exists before using it in .createDocsWebApp().\r\n\r\nRefactored the createDocsWebApp method of the JettyServer.java class. Previously NiFi would fail to\r\nstart up and instead throw an IllegalStatException if the ''docs' directory did not exist in the\r\ninstallation directory. With the update, if the 'docs' directory is missing, an attempt to create\r\nthe missing directory will be made and if successful will enable NIFI to startup successfully, barring\r\nany other startup errors of course. The side effect of this change is that the help documentation\r\nunder the 'General' heading of the help page will be missing but the start up process will have \r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nThree small helper methods were extracted from the original method.  Each related to a section of the\r\noriginal code that could throw an exception. In each case if an exception is now thrown a more helpful\r\nlog message will be output and the process will be closed via the startUpfailure method rather than\r\nthrowing an exception\r\n\r\nThe update was tested successfully on my local instance of NiFi with various scenarios (missing directories, introduced exceptions, etc).  Due to the fact that the updated method is private and several layers into the call chain of the Jetty server constructor there did not appear to be a clean way to write a unit test.  Conversation with one of the committers suggested submitting without a unit test given this situation. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Contrib-check build discovered a long line in ProcessGroupResource.java. Re-formatted line to pass checkstyle requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

removed the Jasypt library (still present w/ `test` scope for backwards-compatibility testing). I re-implemented the relevant logic using Java cryptographic primitives. This will make unit testing much easier, reduce our attack surface because we no longer depend on an un-maintained library, and allows for more reasonable security decisions that are not obfuscated by the library. \r\n\r\nI added unit tests (some ignored as I will build out additional functionality, but this is sufficient for removal of the library), but manual verification is important. To do this:\r\n\r\n1. Create a flow with processors that store sensitive values (a sample flow [here](https://gist.github.com/alopresto/28e748358455e93bfc774556ba820b6e) encrypts and then decrypts text -- both components store a key value). \r\n1. Stop NiFi\r\n1. Use the `encrypt-config` tool to migrate the `flow.xml.gz` to use a new `nifi.sensitive.props.key` (and be sure to update the value in `nifi.properties` as well). \r\n    1. Note that the flow provided above already uses the `...key` *newpassword*, so enter something different if using that flow\r\n    1. This command is operating on a copied flow definition, be sure to point at your actual `flow.xml.gz`\r\n    1. `./bin/encrypt-config.sh -n ../../../../../nifi-assembly/target/nifi-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/nifi-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT/conf/nifi.properties -f ~/Workspace/scratch/encrypt.xml.gz -g ~/Workspace/scratch/encrypt_changed.xml.gz -v -x -s newpassword`\r\n1. Verify that the `nifi.properties` file has a new `nifi.sensitive.props.key` value. `more conf/nifi.properties | grep '\\''sensitive\\|assw\\|key\\|trust'\\''`\r\n1. Start NiFi. \r\n1. Verify that the flow still works. \r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
