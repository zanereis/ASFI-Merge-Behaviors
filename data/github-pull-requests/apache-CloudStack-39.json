Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWhen the network service offering of a network is changed from\r\n\"defualt deny\" to \"default allow\", the ping from VM to

Create a network offering with static nat enabled and default policy as \"DENY\"\r\n2 . Create a vm in it and try to ping 8.8.8.8 from the vm\r\n3 . Ping will fail\r\n4. Now add an ICMP egress rule with code -1\r\n5. Try to ping 8.8.8.8 from vm and this time ping will work\r\n6. Add or remove any other egress rule and the ping should still work\r\n7. Now create a new network offering with static nat enable and default egress policy as \"ALLOW\"\r\n8. Change the network offering of the above created network to the newly created network offering\r\n9. Now ssh to vm and try to ping 8.8.8.8\r\n10. Ping wont work because of the existing ICMP egress rule.\r\n11. Now remove the ICMP egress rule and try to ping 8.8.8.8 from VM\r\n12. The ping still DOES NOT work\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\nThe ping should work at step 12 since default egress policy is ALLOW\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n\r\nThe ping doesn't work even though the

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nCurrently, the cloudstack sends VM password only to the first\r\nrouter in the network even if its the backup and return the result.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the first router will be back up and the second will be master.\r\nSince password server is not running in backup, when the user resets the password,\r\nit is sent to the first router which can be backup.\r\nIn that case, the new password is not stored in the password server and users cant log in with a new password.\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that we send the password to both the routers instead\r\nof the first router so that a new password is stored in the master router.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case

Create and isolated network with redundant VR and a VM in it.\r\n2 . Note down the password of the newly created and try to ssh to it from VR\r\n3 . Ssh works with the existing password.\r\n4 . Now reboot the master VR so that it will become BACKUP and the BACKUP will become MASTER\r\n5 . Now stop the VM and reset it's password.\r\n6 .

instead of haproxy 1.7\r\n\r\nother changes\r\n(3) add global setting systemvm.root.disk.size\r\n(4) when systemvm starts,  allocate all free spaces on disk to  the extend partition, root partition (/dev/vda6) and file system.\r\n\r\nThis applies on all systemvms (cpvm,ssvm,virtual routers, etc)\r\n\r\nThis fixes #3455 \r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nThis fixes few issues below\r\n(1) when add/remove a vpc tier, the keepalived is restarted on both master and backup VRs, which causes some seconds donwtime of vpc.\r\n(2) when remove a vpc tier, the password server is not stopped.\r\n(3) vpc tier is shutdown because no vm is running for 20 minutes, if we start a vm in the vpc tier, it will be implemented. however the guest ip in VPC VRs will be changed , and password server is still running with old guest ip in VRs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nWhen we add new guest os, sometimes we missed the records in guest_os_hypervisor. \r\nHowever, the guest disk model (virtio/ide) is determined by record in the table.\r\nIt causes the issue that some new guest os(eg Debian 8/9) uses e1000 instead of virtio nic, and ide disk instead of virtio disk.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue permanantly, pass the guest os name in guest_os if the record for kvm is not found in guest_os_hypervisor.\r\n\r\nRelated commit:7ac9f00eeeb4cd37ec39efeba066e799b581b1a0\r\n<!-- For new features,

All you need is a MITM!](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/update-want-to-take-over-the-java-ecosystem-all-you-need-is-a-mitm-d069d253fe23?source=friends_link&sk=8c8e52a7d57b98d0b7e541665688b454)\n\n---\n\nThis is a security fix for a  vulnerability in your [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) `pom.xml` file(s).\n\nThe build files indicate that this project is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS.\nThis leaves your build vulnerable to allowing a [Man in the Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) (MITM) attackers to execute arbitrary code on your or your computer or CI/CD system.\n\nThis vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of [8.1/10](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\n\n[POC code](https://max.computer/blog/how-to-take-over-the-computer-of-any-java-or-clojure-or-scala-developer/) has existed since 2014 to maliciously compromise a JAR file in-flight.\nMITM attacks against HTTP are [increasingly common](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/12050), for example [Comcast is known to have done it to their own users](https://thenextweb.com/insights/2017/12/11/comcast-continues-to-inject-its-own-code-into-websites-you-visit/#).\n\nThis contribution is a part of a submission to the [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) Bug Bounty program.\n\n## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities\n\nThis vulnerability was automatically detected by [LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com) using this [CodeQL Query](https://lgtm.com/rules/1511115648721/).\n\nAs of September 2019 LGTM.com and Semmle are [officially a part of GitHub](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-github-welcomes-semmle/).\n\nYou can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [LGTM App](https://github.com/marketplace/lgtm).\n\nI'm not an employee of GitHub nor of Semmle, I'm simply a user of [LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com) and an open-source security researcher.\n\n## Source\n\nYes, this contribution was automatically generated, however, the code to generate this PR was lovingly hand crafted to bring this security fix to your repository.\n\nThe source code that generated and submitted this PR can be found here:\n[JLLeitschuh/bulk-security-pr-generator](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/bulk-security-pr-generator)\n\n## Opting-Out\n\nIf you'd like to opt-out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called\n`.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt` to your repository with the line:\n\n```\nUser-agent: JLLeitschuh/bulk-security-pr-generator\nDisallow: *\n```\n\nThis bot will respect the [ROBOTS.txt](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) format for future contributions.\n\nAlternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider [archiving](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories) the repository.\n\n## CLA Requirements\n\n_This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions._\n\nIt is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs. However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin \n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n##

Description\r\nAfter a local template is uploaded via browser, the generated usage event with type = \"TEMPLATE.CREATE\" is persisted with the data store ID instead of the zone ID on the zone_id column. The fix will refactor the upload monitor logic, as after the upload completes, it sets the datastore ID on the zone ID column for the created \"TEMPLATE.CREATE\" usage event. This refactor will query the DB for the data store and will set its associated zone ID in the usage field.\r\nThe fix produces the same behaviour as when registering a template from URL.\r\nFIx is also for uploading VOLUME from local/via browser.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Create two VPC's. Configure VPN customer gateway and VPN connection. The steps are clearly explained [here](https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/projects/cloudstack-administration/en/4.8/networking/site_to_site_vpn.html#site-to-site-vpn-connection-between-vpc-networks)\r\n2 . Now navigate to networks section in main cloudstack ui. In the drop down menu select VPC. Click configure on one of the VPC\r\n3 . Click on \"Create Network\" and create a tier with \"DefaultisolatedNetworkOfferingForVPCNetworksWithInternalLB\" network offering\r\n4 . Once the tier is created click on \"Internal LB\" tab.\r\n5 . In the right side, click on \"Add Internal LB\" button\r\n6 . Enter the input according to your needs and press OK\r\n7 . Once the Internal LB is created, click on it and select the \"Assigned VM's\" tab.\r\n8 . Click on \"Assign VM's\" button and select the VM's which are present in this tier. If none are present then create vm's.\r\n9 . This will create a new type of router \"internallb\" which can be listed using the cloudmonkey command \"list internalloadbalancervms\" whose name starts with b-\r\n10 . Change the state of any VPN connection in this VPC and observe the logs for the keyword \"Site-to-site Vpn Connection to <VPN gw name> on router b-<>-VM\"\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n\r\nA log mesasge

Create two VPC's. Configure VPN customer gateway and VPN connection. The steps are clearly explained in [here](https://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/projects/cloudstack-administration/en/4.8/networking/site_to_site_vpn.html#site-to-site-vpn-connection-between-vpc-networks)\r\n2 . Once everything is setup properly make sure that the VPN state is \"Connected\" in both VPC.\r\n3 . Now navigate to \"Infrastructure\" → \"Virtual Routers\"\r\n4 . Search for the routers which belong to one of the VPC created above\r\n5 . Now stop the Backup router and eventually destroy it. It is important that you stop/destroy the Backup router and not the Master router\r\n6 . Now navigate to \"Networks\" → Select \"VPC\" in the select view drop down menu and select the VPC for which the virtual router has been destroyed.\r\n7 . Now restart the VPC without cleanup. This will create a new backup VR.\r\n8 . Once the backup vr is created, stop/destroy the master router. The steps are similar to destroying the backup router\r\n9 . Again navigate to Networks → vpc and restart the VPC without cleanup. The initial backup router will become the master and a new backup router will be created\r\n10 .

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nIn VM migration on KVM, libvirt qemu hook script will change the bridge name to bridges for guest networks. It works for user vm. However for virtual router, it has nics on control network and public network. If control/public use different physical networks than guest network, virtual router cannot be migrated.\r\n\r\nFixes: #2783 \r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nIn VPC, the private gateway has traffic type as Guest not Public.\r\nThis leads to keepalived misconfiguration in VPC with redundant VRs.\r\n\r\nThere are some commits (eg 65cb22216aa1d5d6257f99d4ad84f80c319cdea9 and f4f9b3ab4ef2ef34e4d8a04c6ebfbf0784497227) for this issue, however the issue still exists in 4.13 and 4.14.\r\n\r\nSimply setting the traffic type of ip address (of private gateway) to Public fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nFixes: #3402 \r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces the new KVM agent extension interface in the form of hooks. Every hook is implemented in Groovy like\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage groovy\r\n\r\nclass BaseTransform {\r\n\tString transform(Object logger, String xml) {\r\n\t\tFile file = new File(\"/tmp/hooks.txt\")\r\n\t\tfile.append(\"------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\r\n\t\tfile.append(xml)\r\n\t\treturn xml\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nnew BaseTransform()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are 3 hooks are implemented now:\r\n1. `XML transformer` which is called right before VM is launched and it allows modifying XML somehow (example above)\r\n\r\n2. `onStart` and `onStop` hooks which are called right after VM state changes to started/stopped.\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage groovy\r\n\r\nclass StateHandler {\r\n\tObject onStart(Object logger, String vmName) {\r\n\t\tFile file = new File(\"/tmp/hooks-start.txt\")\r\n\t\tfile.append(vmName)\r\n\t\treturn null\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n        Object onStop(Object logger, String vmName) {\r\n\t\tFile file = new File(\"/tmp/hooks-stop.txt\")\r\n\t\tfile.append(vmName)\r\n                return null\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n\r\nnew StateHandler()\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery hook is run inside `try {} catch (Exception e) {}`, so it can not cause agent misbehavior. If hooks are not defined, they are skipped.\r\n\r\nAlso, the PR adds initial support for GitLab CICD for those, who does WIPs with GitLab, not in GitHub.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nInitial RFC/Proposal: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/3823\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nAssociating static NAT on IP to VM fails even though the IP is not allocated.\r\nWhen we try enable static NAT on second IP address to the same VM, the operation fails but the IP address is still allocated in the db and it can't be used to enable static NAT on different VM.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML

(vpc-001-001)\r\n\r\n(2) create a vm (vm-001-001) in vpc-001-001\r\n\r\n(3) acquire a public ip (ip-1) and enable static nat to vm-001-001,\r\noperation succeeds.\r\n\r\n(4) acquire a second public ip (ip-2) and enable static nat to the same vm vm-001-001.\r\nThe operation fails but the ip is still assigned to vpc tier vpc-001-001.\r\nNote down the ip address and the id of it.\r\n\r\n(5) create another vpc vpc-002, vpc tier vpc-001-002, and vm (vm-001-002) in the second tier\r\n\r\n(6) enable static NAT on second IP ip-2  to vm-001-002.\r\n\r\nExpected Result:\r\n\r\nEnabling static NAT on

Description\r\nThis FR proposes the extension of the direct download support to primary storage pools using the most commonly used protocols/storage types:\r\n- NFS – already supported\r\n- Local storage\r\n- SharedMountpoint\r\n\r\nOther storage providers support can be extended in future by interface implementation on the KVM storage provider depending on the storage adaptor.\r\n\r\nThe KVM storage processor is extended to achieve the direct template downloads in a storage agnostic way, including the supported storage providers implementations and allowing future implementations for different storage providers:\r\n- A new check of the available free space on the downloading host local storage is added before attempting to download a template. As on registration, a CheckUrlCommand is sent to a random KVM host, this host performs a HEAD command to the template URL. In case the server provides the remote file size of the template, this size is passed as part of the DirectDownloadCommand and used to check against the available free space.\r\n- The template file is downloaded to a scratch space in the local storage system within the host. This location can be explicitly set by the administrator via agent.properties file on the property: `direct.download.temporary.download.location`, and in case it is not set the default location `var/lib/libvirt/images` is used.\r\n- After the template file is downloaded to the scratch space location, it is extracted (or copied) to the primary storage pool selected by the CloudStack planner.\r\n- The implementation of the extract/copy method is extended to invoke the different StorageAdaptors implementations for different storage providers. These implementations include local storage, shared mount point and NFS in the scope of this PR.\r\n- After the template is extracted/copied to the destination storage pool, the downloaded file is removed from the scratch space location in the host.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nUbuntu based management server\r\nTest zone with local storage for user

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nPreviously, iscsi sessions would not be cleaned up on KVM when\r\n\r\n* vms are crashed or rebooted on another host\r\n* a hypervisor host crashed and ha enabled vms\r\n\r\nThis leads to to long boot times from the hypervisor host and session overloading of the netapp solidfire nodes. Each node can have a maximum of 700 iSCSI sessions. The iSCSI Daemon on the hypervisor host holds iSCSI sessions that are not cleaned up. The iSCSI Daemon tried to reconnect every time resulting in holding the unused sessions. Only a logout of the iSCSI daemon to the volume will solve the problem. This changes adds a kvm.storage.IscsiStorageCleanupMonitor class that scans for and cleans up inactive iscsi sessions.\r\n\r\nsteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. check there are a vm is running and sessions to Netapp Solidfire are there ```ìscsiadm -m session -P 0```\r\n2. crash the kvm host (e.g. power off, be sure there are running vms on it) or destroy a virtual machine (```virsh destroy vmname```)\r\n3. look with ```ìscsiadm -m session -P 0``` and you will see sessions they should not be there\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nWhen the injectkeys.sh script runs, if the public ssh key is the same as the authorized_keys file inside the extracted systemvm.iso - then the public ssh key files is NOT copied over and the systemvm.iso is not modified - message added to explain just that.\r\n\r\nAlso, after the injectkeys.sh is run/finished, from the Java code we currently generate a wrong message that the private key has also been injected (we don't inject it, only the public key) - and in general sometimes NOTHING is injected - so changed the messages accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!---

Description\r\nPreviously, volume access groups were assigned with the convention Cloudstack-RandomUUID. This change proposes that that we use Cloudstack-clusterUuId instead.\r\n\r\nThe problem addressed by this PR is that under some conditions multiple volume access groups with random uuids are created. This is illustrated in the screenshot below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45833770/73491211-14ab5580-437c-11ea-9518-c2f335e11833.png)\r\nOne of the scenarios in which this occurs is when upgrades are done to the hypervisor hosts by removing, re-provisioning them and re-adding them.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

created\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce in test environment with two hosts:\r\n\r\n1. - Create VMs\r\n2. - Remove all hosts\r\n3. - Re-Add hosts\r\n4. - Start VMs\r\n\r\n_Outcome before applying this patch:_\r\nA new volume access group is created with the convention CloudStack-RandomUUID\r\n_After applying this patch:_\r\nIf an existing volume access group with the naming convention CloudStack-clusterUuId exists, it will be used otherwise a volume access group with this naming convention will be created.\r\n\r\n### Backward Compatibility test\r\n\r\n1. - initial scenario old code, two hosts, volume access group name with random-uuid\r\n2. - switch to new code\r\n3. - remove one host\r\n4. - re-add host\r\n\r\n_Outcome before applying this patch:_\r\nno new volume access group created, existing volume access group with random-uuid is used.\r\n_After applying this patch:_\r\nno new volume access group created, existing volume access group with random-uuid is

Description\r\nRemove the empty item from the free IP list when we click on \"Acquire New IP\" in the networks section.\r\nIf we dont select any IP address from the list and click ok, it sends \"ipaddress=-1\" as the parameter which is not back compatible.\r\n\r\nThis fix ensures that no empty item is displayed and by default one valid ip selected. So when we click ok, \"ipaddress=-1\" wont be sent as a parameter to the api call.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Navigate to \"Networks\" section in the main UI\r\n2 . Select any network from the list.\r\n3 . Click on \"View IP address\" button.\r\n4 . Now click on \"Acquire New IP\" button on the top right.

Description\r\nCurrently, we can create multiple physical networks in the same traffic\r\ntypes with null tags. This feature will ensure that we can create at most\r\n1 physical network in the same traffic type with a null tag.\r\n\r\nEvery physical network should be associated with a tag so that when we create\r\na new shared network, using the tags we can match the shared network with\r\nthe physical network\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Create a physical network\r\n```\r\ncreate physicalnetwork zoneid=76aecb3c-c246-4cf7-9410-1116596a26f7 isolationmethods=VLAN name=TEST\r\n```\r\n\r\n2 . Create another physical network without any tag\r\n```\r\ncreate physicalnetwork zoneid=76aecb3c-c246-4cf7-9410-1116596a26f7 isolationmethods=VLAN name=TEST-2\r\n```\r\n\r\n3 . Now try to add traffic type to any of the physical network created above. This should fail since there are more than 1 physical network without any tags\r\n```\r\nadd traffictype physicalnetworkid=fed2091b-9db9-40be-be32-4bdc2c4cdd23 traffictype=Guest kvmnetworklabel=cloudbr9\r\n\r\n\r\nError 530: There are more than 1 physical network without tags in the zone= 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n4 . Now add the tag to one of the physical network\r\n```\r\nupdate physicalnetwork id=fed2091b-9db9-40be-be32-4bdc2c4cdd23 tags=NGN\r\n```\r\n\r\n5 . Now we can successfully add the traffic type\r\n```\r\n add traffictype physicalnetworkid=fed2091b-9db9-40be-be32-4bdc2c4cdd23 traffictype=Guest kvmnetworklabel=cloudbr9\r\n\r\n\r\ncmd = org.apache.cloudstack.api.command.admin.usage.AddTrafficTypeCmd\r\njobid = 15afffb2-c600-428a-a691-a7767a145e84\r\njobinstanceid = 3995aec3-1cea-4f57-bce2-c99e34e54298\r\njobinstancetype = TrafficType\r\njobprocstatus = 0\r\njobresult:\r\ntraffictype:\r\nid = 3995aec3-1cea-4f57-bce2-c99e34e54298\r\nkvmnetworklabel = cloudbr9\r\nphysicalnetworkid = fed2091b-9db9-40be-be32-4bdc2c4cdd23\r\ntraffictype = Guest\r\njobresultcode = 0\r\njobresulttype = object\r\njobstatus = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n6 .  If we try to update the network to delete the tags, it should fail because there is already another network without tag\r\n\r\n```\r\nupdate physicalnetwork id=fed2091b-9db9-40be-be32-4bdc2c4cdd23 tags=Error\r\n\r\nAsync job 7d1e9b8a-95d1-4dd3-be3d-125e314a6bd5 failed\r\nError 530, There are more than 1 physical network without tags in the zone= 1\r\n\r\ncmd =

Description\r\nCurrently in cloudstack, when we click on \"Acquire New Ip\", it will\r\nrandomly acquire IP from the pool. With this enhancement, it is\r\npossible to select the IP from the drop down IP list of that network.\r\nSame thing applies for a VPC as well.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
