Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the database name in the `\"mango-stats\"` alongside the existing data around documents processed to generate the request. The motivation here is two fold: 1) there's a scenario where `chttpd:maybe_log` returns false and the chttpd socket handling the request has died where a front load balancer processing the request never got the `X-Couch-Request-ID`, thereby losing the connection of the underlying request that induced the particular load; this is especially problematic when the socket died because the request was excessively long. 2) this allows for grouping by dbname directly on the reports, making it easier to quickly scan and summarize activity from the report.\r\n\r\nThis PR also sneaks in a patch to `mango_cursor_nouveau` to include the recent stats logic patch.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI've added a new test to show the `dbname` field arrives in the `couch_log:report` logic yet does not extend the field into the http response when the `_find` query does `execution_stats=true`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [X] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] Documentation changes were made in the `src/docs` folder\r\n- [ ] Documentation changes were backported (separated PR) to affected branches\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-23T21:40:06Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T20:09:32Z","closed_at":"2024-03-05T22:44:08Z","merged_at":"2024-03-05T22:44:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab2cf16a60f4cf1cdde7b3f8c2b8e9828ca46fe5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/792815028ca096b4ca6edadb545f411a52b39ae2","head":{"label":"apache:add-dbname-to-mango-exec-stats","ref":"add-dbname-to-mango-exec-stats","sha":"792815028ca096b4ca6edadb545f411a52b39ae2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

concern was to make sure to return the updated map object, when before we just returned `ok`.\r\n\r\n * ddoc_cache_lru already had an almost 100% test coverage so opted to rely those tests.\r\n\r\n * Performance with maps seems to at least as good or better than with the khash nif [2].\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4977\r\n[2]

`#view_row{}` record that is used for capturing messages with row data is not flexible enough to have it extended easily.  If one wanted to introduce a fresh field, the change would have to be propagated through many functions and modules.  Especially, if support for mixed-version clusters is a concern, this would come with some degree of duplication.\r\n\r\nLeverage Erlang/OTP's built-in maps for mitigating this issue and offer the view callbacks the `view_row_map` Boolean key in `#mrargs.extra` to request this communication format.  This way the old record-based format would be still in use unless requested otherwise.  This facilitates the smooth interoperability of old coordinators and new workers.  In parallel to that, the new coordinator could still receive view rows from old workers.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe unit and integration tests should cover all the changes.  There are no user-facing changes, it is internal to the communication of the coordinator and the workers over fabric.  Backwards compatibility is maintained.\r\n\r\n```console\r\nmake eunit apps=fabric,couch_replicator,mango\r\nmake elixir\r\nmake elixir-search\r\nmake mango-test\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnit test coverage

`--node-number` parameter is not interpreted correctly so that the node identifiers are shifted everywhere in the same way.  For example, the lead port and node ports are assigned with no regard to what was set as the starting node index.\r\n\r\nThis could be a problem if, for example, one wants to simulate mixed-version cluster configurations and launch a set of nodes starting from a given index and use another invocation of the script to run another set of nodes with different subset of indexes.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThere are no automated tests, but this can be tried out manually.  For example, with Clouseau enabled, setting the node number to 2, both the ports and the Clouseau indexes are shifted:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ make devclean\r\n$ dev/run -a adm:pass --with-clouseau --node-number=2 -n 2\r\n[ * ] Setup environment ... ok\r\n[ * ] Ensure CouchDB is built ... ok\r\n[ * ] Ensure Erlang boot script exists ... ok\r\n[ * ] Prepare configuration files ... ok\r\n[ * ]

module is monitoring shards whose names match a particular suffix, and notifies users with found, updated and deleted events. This is the module which drives replicator jobs when `*/_replicator` databases are updated.\r\n\r\nPreviously, couch_multidb_changes reacted only to node-local shard file events and was not aware of the shard map membership of those files. This was mostly evident during shard moves: the target shard could be created long before the\r\nshard file becomes a part of the shard map. The replicator could notice the new target shard file and spawn a replication job on the new node, but keep the same replication job running on the source node. The two replication jobs will eventually conflict in the PG system (https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/pg.html) and one of them would start crashing with a \"duplicate job\" error. This could last days depending on how long it would take to populate the data on the target. Even after recovery, the target shard could be backed-off up to another extra 8 hours until it may run again.\r\n\r\nTo avoid issues like that, make couch_multidb_changes aware of shard map membership updates. When a shard file is discovered, and it is not in the shard map, mark it with a `wait_shard_map = true` flag. Then, re-use the existing db event monitoring mechanism to notice when shards db is updated, and schedule a delayed membership check for the shards tracked in our ETS table.\r\n\r\nOther changes to the module are mostly cosmetic:\r\n\r\n * Remove the unused `created` callback. `db_found` is used instead, both when dbs are created, and during startup when they are discovered.\r\n\r\n * In the ETS table use a proper `#row{}` record since we now have 5 items in the tuple. This simplifies some of the existing code as well.\r\n\r\n * During deletion and creation, actually delete the entries from the ETS table. Previously we didn't do it so the would hang around forever until the node was restarted.\r\n\r\n * Add comments to a few tricky sections explaining what should be happening there.\r\n\r\n * Add more tests, both the old and new functionality. Increase coverage from 96% to

case of map-reduce views, the arrival of the `complete` message is not guaranteed for the view callback (at the shard) when a `stop` is issued during the aggregation (at the coordinator).  Due to that, internally collected shard-level statistics may not be fed back to the coordinator which can cause data loss hence inaccuracy in the overall execution statistics.\r\n\r\nAddress this issue by switching to a \"rolling\" model where row-level statistics are immediately streamed back to the coordinator.  Support mixed-version cluster upgrades by activating this model only if requested through the map-reduce arguments and the given shard supports that.\r\n\r\nNote that this change shares some similarities with @chewbranca's work on Couch Stats Resource Tracker though it stems from a different origin.  In the long run, the goal is to either have it merged or even replaced with that approach to facilitate convergence.  It has a smaller scope hence it is less complicated and it is ready for inclusion.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRunning the respective Mango unit and integration test suites shall suffice (which is done by the CI):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmake eunit apps=mango\r\nmake mango-test MANGO_TEST_OPTS=\"15-execution-stats-test\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut there is a detailed description in related the ticket (see below) on how to trigger the problem, which might also be used to exercise the code change.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nOriginates from #4735, forerunner of

documentation on how to have CouchDB installed and enabled as a service on FreeBSD contains a number of outdated information. This change is to bring it to up to date along the following lines:\r\n\r\n- The port/package has been renamed to `couchdb3`.\r\n- The configuration options and location for the configuration files for the port have changed.\r\n- Propagate the `service` command to work with the wrapper script instead of accessing the script itself directly.\r\n- Mention the binary package path (installation via `pkg`) which has become quite a standard these days.\r\n- Remove instructions on manually creating the `couchdb` user and group.  There is no need for those any more, it shall be handled by the port/package.","created_at":"2024-01-09T12:59:01Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T19:33:47Z","closed_at":"2024-01-10T19:33:44Z","merged_at":"2024-01-10T19:33:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"20c30a514e81432630ad03da6ec45b8faebbff0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4955/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4955/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4955/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/b3163648ef0b290bcf116ecf0a8daeec9a3737dd","head":{"label":"pgj:fix/docs/freebsd-install","ref":"fix/docs/freebsd-install","sha":"b3163648ef0b290bcf116ecf0a8daeec9a3737dd","user":{"login":"pgj","id":277835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj","html_url":"https://github.com/pgj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":589935401,"node_id":"R_kgDOIymzKQ","name":"couchdb","full_name":"pgj/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pgj","id":277835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj","html_url":"https://github.com/pgj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pgj/couchdb","description":"Seamless

is in charge of monitoring changes to multiple databases. It is what drives the couch_replicator application when users update replication docs. It starts off by scanning all the local db shards and launches changes feeds for each of them. After it processes each changes feed, it checkpoints where it stops. As the shards are updated, it starts change feeds for those updated shards and checkpoints again. The checkpoints are kept in an ets table and the main logic which decides when to start a changes feed for a particular shard is in the resume_scan/2 function.\r\n\r\nThis change makes a few small optimizations:\r\n\r\n * Use a map to track Pid -> DbName mappings. This avoids using a O(N) operation for looking up exiting change feed processes. So `pids` is switched to be a map of `#{Pid => DbName}` and the ets table has a 4th tuple member to keep track of `dbname -> pid` mappings.\r\n\r\n * Previously, when the plain \"suffix\" dbname (just <<\"_replicator\">>) was found, we tried to open and close it to see if it exists. Change to use `couch_server:exists/1` instead.\r\n\r\nThe are also a few clean-ups:\r\n\r\n * Update tests to use ?TDEF_FE/?TDEF macros. This shortens them a bit and saves one indentation level.\r\n\r\n * Increase test coverage from 86% to 96%. To help create a few more test scenarios switched to using a public ets table instead of a private one.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-12T17:32:01Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T00:58:38Z","closed_at":"2023-12-13T00:58:34Z","merged_at":"2023-12-13T00:58:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"641b39373d540fbb8eb4c31700ff88d2503a7b98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4911/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4911/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4911/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/dc7e058eb0b61ca9e41c3dd7e4a3e8622420b82a","head":{"label":"apache:clean-up-multidb-changes","ref":"clean-up-multidb-changes","sha":"dc7e058eb0b61ca9e41c3dd7e4a3e8622420b82a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

the execution statistics that could be shown for the user, the number of rows and documents read are tracked separately on the global level.  (Which is more like a bug than a feature, but that is out of the scope of this change.)\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of covering indexes, these two have been become different, therefore global counting has to be taught about the number of times when no documents were read but rows only.  For `text` indexes, the number of rows and documents should be the same, the distinction makes sense only for `json` indexes.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThe changes are covered by the

ensures that the coordinator process flushes on demonitoring of the attachment refs in chttpd_db. The problem here is that it's possible to receive a 'DOWN' message for the monitor ref that is not receive'ed, causing it to stick around in the coordinator message queue while the next http request is handled. The pending message will not become apparent until the next fabric call is invoked, as fabric expects to have full access to all messages in the calling process, an expectation which is violated by the pending message, causing a case clause crash in the fabric receive message callbacks.\r\n\r\nI noticed this during eunit runs with stubbed attachment handles that generate an immediate noproc message on the monitor call. Normal operations should not result in an immediate noproc result on monitoring the attachment process, however, any failure that causes the attachment process to fail between acquisition of the refs and the demonitor calls will induce this bug, causing the next http request handled by the particular chttpd coordinator pool processs to fail on whatever next fabric call is made.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-09T00:37:41Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T18:07:57Z","closed_at":"2023-12-12T22:11:39Z","merged_at":"2023-12-12T22:11:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"fae8761c1ee7c5919a22274fd9356a45e9271316","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/c3c364c073a90facca7b7fa229d0fe0cdb587dfb","head":{"label":"apache:flush-chttpd-attachment-monitors","ref":"flush-chttpd-attachment-monitors","sha":"c3c364c073a90facca7b7fa229d0fe0cdb587dfb","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently, `dev/run` only starts CouchDB if the `[admins]` section is last in `local.ini`. Otherwise, it will fail, and log this message:\r\n```\r\n[info] 2023-12-02T21:50:40.510174Z node1@127.0.0.1 <0.262.0> --------\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n  No Admin Account Found, aborting startup.\r\n  Please configure an admin account in your local.ini file.\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n```\r\nlooking at the `local.ini` in question, we see:\r\n```\r\n[admins]\r\n;admin = mysecretpassword\r\n[foo]\r\nbar = baz\r\n\r\nadm = -pbkdf2:sha256-8b982d3bfcf15ded130fcfe721c34fe77cda990850d6ec42fb056fe4478c79a9,01d8d790d7fd4526bf342a90f706168f,10\r\n```\r\nwhere the admin user has been appended to the end of the file instead of in the `[admins]` section.\r\n\r\nThis relaxes that restriction by inserting the admin user just after the `[admin]` section line, rather than at the end of the file.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\necho -e '[foo]\\nbar = baz\\n' >> rel/overlay/etc/local.ini\r\ndev/run -a adm:pass \r\n```\r\nshould actually start, and e.g. `tail -20  dev/lib/node1/etc/local.ini` should contain something like\r\n```\r\n[admins]\r\nadm =

Overview\r\n\r\nWeatherreport is hard-coded to assume the search node is at 'clouseau@127.0.0.1' and that it is running. This results in a useless warning for users that do not have search enabled, and also means that it will fail to connect if Clouseau is running somewhere other than 127.0.0.1.\r\n\r\nThis replaces the hard-coded node name with a config lookup to `[dreyfus] name` and handles the case of it not being set.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nOn `main`, running `weatherreport` against my dev cluster prints this warning about Clouseau not responding, regardless of what `[dreyfus] name` is set to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./weatherreport -c ../../dev/lib/node1/etc\r\n['node1@127.0.0.1'] [warning] Local search node at 'clouseau@127.0.0.1' not responding: pang\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change, the above warning is not printed unless `[dreyfus] name` has been set:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cdb '/_node/_local/_config/dreyfus/name' -X DELETE\r\n\"clouseau1@127.0.0.1\"\r\n\r\n$ ./weatherreport -c ../../dev/lib/node1/etc\r\n(no warning)\r\n\r\n$ cdb '/_node/_local/_config/dreyfus/name' -X PUT -d '\"clouseau@example.com\"'\r\n\"\"\r\n\r\n$ ./weatherreport -c ../../dev/lib/node1/etc\r\n['node1@127.0.0.1'] [warning] Local search node at 'clouseau@example.com' not responding: pang\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nUsing Python 3.12.0 for `dev/run` gives these warnings:\r\n```\r\n❯ dev/run -a adm:pass --with-haproxy --no-eval REMSHID=1 dev/remsh\r\n/Users/jay/repos/couchdb/dev/run:534: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\d'\r\n  JAVA_VERSION_RE = re.compile('\"(\\d+\\.\\d+).*\"')\r\n/Users/jay/repos/couchdb/dev/run:686: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\['\r\n

\"raw\" format, and eliminates the warnings.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nInstalling Python `3.12.0` and running e.g.\r\n```\r\ndev/run -a adm:pass --with-haproxy --no-eval REMSHID=1 dev/remsh\r\n```\r\nshould not display any

written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] Documentation changes were made in

change features a set of extensions to the integration of Clouseau in the developer setup, added in 2d8a33b9:\r\n\r\n- Introduce the `--clouseau-dir` option for the `./dev/run` script to allow for ad-hoc integration of Clouseau with CouchDB, even without being configured previously.  This facilities experimentation with various alternatives and lets the user switch between them with ease.\r\n\r\n- The directory specified by `--clouseau-dir` could either hold an unpacked set of JAR files or `git` clone of the Clouseau source code.  The script can automagically determine which version is being used and invoke [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to compile the sources and launch the nodes with the proper classpath.  In this latter case, check for JDK 1.7 because that is the edition that could be used for compiling the sources currently.\r\n\r\n- Modify the `./configure` script to support deploying locally a specific branch of Clouseau's `git` clone instead of a tagged release.\r\n\r\n- Adjust the `Makefile`s to set `--clouseau-dir` by the `CLOUSEAU_DIR` variable.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards compatible with the additions of the original commit.  The new scenarios that are worth trying could be the following.\r\n\r\n- Run `./dev/run` without Clouseau being configured by `./configure`, using `--clouseau-dir` (together with `--with-clouseau`).\r\n- Configure a Clouseau release locally and override it with `--clouseau-dir`.\r\n- Configure a branch of the [Clouseau source code repository](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/clouseau) or one of its forks for local use.\r\n- Run Clouseau through the `elixir-search` and `mango-test` make targets.\r\n- Use everything as before (to verify backwards compatibility).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-23T20:46:25Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T11:48:30Z","closed_at":"2023-12-05T11:48:20Z","merged_at":"2023-12-05T11:48:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"4ace5f13971aba8d3f858a69ea5f4404b5355951","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4871/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4871/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4871/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/8627e835868f01047b2ab2c817e4dc7d4fc7b71b","head":{"label":"pgj:feat/dev/extend-clouseau-setup","ref":"feat/dev/extend-clouseau-setup","sha":"8627e835868f01047b2ab2c817e4dc7d4fc7b71b","user":{"login":"pgj","id":277835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj","html_url":"https://github.com/pgj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":589935401,"node_id":"R_kgDOIymzKQ","name":"couchdb","full_name":"pgj/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pgj","id":277835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj","html_url":"https://github.com/pgj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pgj/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n   \r\n- When filered `_changes` is triggered, `open_revs()` will\r\nread docs. If request parameter has `include_docs=true`,\r\nthen `doc_member()` will also read docs.\r\n\r\nChange `filter/3` to `filter/5` to avoid the above behavior.\r\n\r\n- When using filtered `_changes` with `style=all_docs`,\r\n`conflicts=true` and `include_docs=true`, the response should\r\ncontain the `_conflicts` field.\r\n\r\nAdd `open_all_revs_include_doc/2` to include this field.\r\n\r\n- Add tests to verify the number of calls to `open_doc/3`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n```bash\r\nmake eunit apps=chttpd suites=chttpd_changes_test\r\nmake eunit apps=couch

This can also be simulated by running `make devclean` and `make clean` if the source have already been build before.
