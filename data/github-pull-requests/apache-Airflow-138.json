PR addresses a backwards incompatible change introduced with https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/17578.\r\n\r\nPrior to the change a task group id could contain all characters that were valid for a task id. With the additional validation of the group id the dot character was removed from the list of valid characters.\r\nAlthough I can understand the rationale behind this, it seems inconsistent/arbitrary to me as illustrated by the picture below.\r\n![task_groups](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100271696/178501811-1d1e5cb4-a21c-4132-bd49-c0bf94c7411b.png)\r\n\r\nThe illustrated tasks all have an effective task id of the form \"A.B.C\". Right now 1.) through 3.) are valid but 4.) is not, which this PR would remedy. Afterwards all 4 cases would be valid.\r\n\r\nI would argue that one cannot reverse engineer the groups from an effective task id alone anyway (e.g. by splitting at every dot), so there should ne no reason why a group id cannot contain a dot.\r\n\r\nHere is a real world example where this would help:\r\nWe use airflow to load our data warehouse. Each table load (of which are more than a thousand) consists of the same steps grouped together in a task group (e.g. truncate, load, refresh_stats). This task group is named after the fully qualified name  of the table, which is \"schema.table_name\".\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last I would like to thank you all for your work on this great piece of

But this new config was making kubernetes to restart the scheduler pods because the [command defined in helm](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/451181f6f2efd8b5e6bd7807e84a17d48a4fe875/chart/templates/_helpers.yaml#L640-L641) was returning a \"No alive jobs found.\"\r\nI therefore updated the cli command jobs to allow the use of `--use-hostname-callable`  in:\r\n```bash\r\nairflow jobs check --job-type SchedulerJob --use-hostname-callable\r\n```\r\nto use the `hostname_callable` that the user defined in its Airflow conf. Also updated the helm chart to with this new conf since I think it will be more reliable than to use linux `hostname` command.","created_at":"2022-07-12T13:25:25Z","updated_at":"2022-10-03T20:44:11Z","closed_at":"2022-10-03T20:31:57Z","merged_at":"2022-10-03T20:31:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"560412179b45a1c855311f25f76f0c9f32d6e940","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1971984525,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTcxOTg0NTI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:helm-chart","name":"area:helm-chart","color":"024e91","default":false,"description":"Airflow

part toward #24489.\r\n\r\nTo support list-of-dicts task-mapping (expand_kwargs), we need different logic in many places of task-mapping to handle the two difference \"shapes\" of data. Instead of putting conditionals everywhere, we should use polymorphism to switch between different implementations.\r\n\r\nThis PR lays the foundation to this. A new class DictOfListsExpandInput is added to wrap kwargs received from expand(), and related logic is moved from MappedOperator to that class. It should be quite obvious in various places that I'm \"leaving room\" for something else; if you feel some abstraction is unnecessary (it's probably not), check #24838 to make sure.\r\n\r\nI also included some trivial annotation and code formatting stuffs here since they don't warrant a separate PR and fit as well here as anywhere else.","created_at":"2022-07-11T17:01:31Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T19:36:16Z","closed_at":"2022-07-12T07:51:47Z","merged_at":"2022-07-12T07:51:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c7a4acbb1fe7882247b3329de87002ff938657d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/

TCP_KEEPALIVE allows to keep the idle connections opened\r\nwhen there are firewalls in-betweeen that close such connections.\r\n\r\nTCP_KEEPALIVE sends a \"no-data\" packet regularly (and expects\r\nACK from the server). This should not be mistaken with Python\r\nrequests \"keep alive\" feature - which reuses opened HTTP connections\r\nif you perform several requests to the same server (both are named\r\nkeep alive but they both mean two completely different things and\r\nare implemented at differen layers of the OSI network stack. The\r\nRequests Keep Alive is Layer 7 (application) and TCP Keep Alive\r\nis at Layer 4 (transport).\r\n\r\nThe \"Requests\" keep alive is enabled by default in the requests\r\nlibrary while the TCP Keep Alive requires a TCPKeepAliveAdapter\r\nto be used (from requests_toolbelt library).\r\n\r\nFixes: #21365\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#23597 #24910\r\n\r\nThis is some pre-work for hopefully/maybe including the [flake8-logging-format](https://github.com/globality-corp/flake8-logging-format) extension in CI. There are roughly 88 file changes so splitting these up into smaller chunks.\r\n\r\nAfter the initial sweeps are completed we can do a final pass when formally implementing the extension in CI.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely certain on if there are impacts to useful info that will be missed with log handlers but would love feedback on general patterns. ~Core PR to come later based on

scheduler was looking at all running tasks for zombies, leading to\r\nmultiple schedulers handling the zombies. This causes problems with\r\nretries (e.g. being marked as FAILED instead of UP_FOR_RETRY) and\r\ncallbacks (e.g. `on_failure_callback` being called multiple times).\r\n\r\nWhen the second scheduler tries to determine if the task is able to be retried,\r\nand it's already in UP_FOR_RETRY (the first scheduler already finished),\r\nit sees the \"next\" try_number (as it's no longer running),\r\nwhich then leads it to be FAILED instead.\r\n\r\nThe easy fix is to simply restrict each scheduler to its own TIs, as\r\norphaned running TIs will be adopted anyways.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-07T20:25:26Z","updated_at":"2022-07-08T17:38:57Z","closed_at":"2022-07-08T16:49:12Z","merged_at":"2022-07-08T16:49:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c0d0a5d907ae447b7221200952b47b69f8f8e87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

\"fix-ownership\" command uses our breeze docker image to fix\r\nownership of files generated by breeze. This is nice from the user\r\nperspective because there is no need to authenticate with password\r\nand - since we already have breeze image handy - it is fast and\r\npainless. However in CI, there are often cases where \"fix-ownership\"\r\ndoes not really have an image available and needs to pull one, which\r\ntakes 1 minute. However the user in CI has sudoer capability without\r\npassword, so we can use it to run fix-ownership with just plain\r\nsudo/chown.\r\n\r\nWe switch all the CI jobs to \"USE_SUDO\" and also avoid running\r\nfix-ownership on other systems that Linux, as the ownership of\r\nfiles creaed from docker as root is only problem when the filesystem\r\nis directly mounted and used in the container (which happens only on\r\nLinux). MacOS and Windows have \"user-space\" filesystem that are\r\nmuch slower, but then they perform user-remapping on their own\r\nand files created in container have automatically ownership of\r\nthe user who runs the docker container command.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

introduced a bug in 2.3.0 as part of the dynamic task mapping work\r\nthat frequently made the mini scheduler fail for tasks involving\r\nXComArgs.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to alter the logic in
