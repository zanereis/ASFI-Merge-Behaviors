https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77317904/apache-beam-python-sdk-reading-from-postgres-using-jdbc-io\r\n\r\nSome context:\r\n\r\nThis has been a long-standing issue. MillisInstant is a logical type that backs Java's DATETIME type in schema (in Java side, its language type is a Joda Instant). In Beam portable framework, DATETIME is no longer a primitive type (true for Python, Go but not for Java), but rather a logical type backed by a MicrosInstant. Its language type is a Java.time.Instant (due to joda is in maintenance mode and there is plan to replace to java.time.Instant.\r\n\r\nThis would be a breaking change and milestoned at next major version). As such, Java SDK still uses DATETIME primitive in schema. MillisInstant logical type was then a workaround introduced, to enable Python xlang JdbcIO to r/w rows contain Timestamps. But it need to register the MillisInstant to overwrite the default mapping (MicrosInstant) --- That is what currently the integration does.\r\n\r\nSince this has been a pain point. It may worth to include this line in the jdbc module. It will then make the MillisInstant supersedes MicrosInstant when jdbc module is imported. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

possible to pass in parameters in properties files (mainly [sdk.properties](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/resources/org/apache/beam/sdk/sdk.properties)) with an empty string, which shouldn't be allowed. Adding a precondition should correct this issue.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's possible to write a test to check for the preconditions, since all the Dataflow runner unit tests populate 'name' and 'version' based on the [name default value](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/util/ReleaseInfo.java#L84) and the above `sdk.properties` file respectively, however, I did perform the following to validate correctness:\r\n\r\n1. Ran all the Java Dataflow runner tests, setting `version=` in `sdk.properties`. The tests passed when ideally they shouldn't.\r\n2. After adding the preconditions, ran the Dataflow runner tests again (still with `version=`). Most tests correctly failed with the proper error message.\r\n3. Set `version=@pom.version@` (its original value). The tests passed again.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

attempts to split our dashboard into categories. Obviously its quite large, so I'll explain the methodology used to generate this and we can go from there with a heavier code review on the more potentially error prone spots.\r\n\r\nI'll also note that I'm planning on making this better over time, so the splitting of things into labels should end up being more precise than it is in this iteration. \r\n\r\nHow I did this:\r\n1) All changes to sync_workflows were manual and should be reviewed normally. The goal here is to add a `dashboard_category` which maps to one of `core_<lang>`, `<runner>_<lang>`, or `misc` so that we can split tests into these categories.\r\n2) To generate the dashboard changes (the bulk of the changes), I used the UI:\r\n\r\n- First, I copied the existing dashboard 12 times using grafana's `duplicate` functionality.\r\n- Next, I modified the title attribute in the UI for each of the dashboards. These are reflected in `\"title\"` attributes in the json (may be easier to find all instances by CMD+F searching for `\"transformations\"` and inspecting the previous line.\r\n- Last, I modified each table's query (CMD+F `\"rawSql\"`) to add a `where` clause. All of these were of the form:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  where\r\n    dashboard_category = 'core_java'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe split up dashboards at least render in my local grafana instance, though its hard to verify that they're doing exactly what they're supposed to do.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the following set of metrics in BigQuery's StorageWriteAPI transforms. These metrics will be stored in the PerWorkerMetrics container defined in (#28923)\r\n\r\n### 1. `AppendRowsRowStatus` Counter\r\n\r\nMetric that tracks the status of BigQuery rows after making an AppendRows RPC call. \r\n- If the AppendRows RPC succeeds, it tracks the number of rows that been successfully scheduled for a flush.\r\n- If the AppendRows RPC fails, it tracks the number of rows that will be retried and failed.\r\n\r\nMetric has labels the following labels:\r\n- `RowStatus`: Status of the BigQuery rows after , one of `SUCCESSFUL`, `RETRIED`, `FAILED`\r\n-  `Status`: gRPC status of the AppendRows RPC\r\n- `TableId`: 'datasets/{ }/tables/{ }' that the rows are sent to.\r\n\r\n### 2. `ThrottledTime` Counter\r\nTracks the total time spent waiting between RPC retries.\r\n\r\nMetric has labels the following labels:\r\n- `Method`: BigQuery method that's causing the throttle. One of `AppendRows`, `FlushRows`, `FinalizeStream`.\r\n\r\n### 3. `RpcRequests` Counter \r\nTracks the Rpc Status of various BigQuery write methods. \r\n\r\nMetric has labels the following labels:\r\n- `Method`: BigQuery sink method. One of `AppendRows`, `FlushRows`, `FinalizeStream`.\r\n-  `Status`: gRPC status of the RPC\r\n- `TableId`: 'datasets/{ }/tables/{ }' that the rows are sent to.\r\n\r\n### 4. `RpcLatency` Histogram:\r\nTracks the Rpc Latency of various BigQuery write methods. \r\n\r\nMetric has labels the following labels:\r\n- `Method`: BigQuery sink method. One of `AppendRows`, `FlushRows`, `FinalizeStream`.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- We pass a Counter to [FluentBackoff.java](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/29098/files#diff-a042b08246e808721029814cac0116ec6c93d94524b9681ea87a9d6935ada29d) which tracks the total time spent backing off aka ThrottleTime. \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
