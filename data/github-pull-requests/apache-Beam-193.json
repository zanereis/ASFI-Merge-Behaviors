Problem Statement\r\n\r\nThe MongoDbIO lacks the following features which limit its usage, especially for applications that deal with large collections.\r\n\r\n* Ability to limit the returned results.\r\n* Ability to use MongoDB's [Aggregations](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/aggregation/).\r\n* The `BoundedMongoDbReader` `start` method is too complex.\r\n* Lacks support to pass native [Filters](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.6/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/model/Filters.html) provided by the MongoDB Java driver.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis PR addresses all of the above mentioned points. It also introduces the following:\r\n\r\n* `FindQueryBuilder`: Should be used to build MongoDB queries similar to `db.collection.find(...)`\r\n* `AggregationQueryBuilder`: Should be used to perform queries using aggregations.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n### Using limit with find queries\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMongoDbIO.read()\r\n    .withUri(\"mongodb://localhost:\" + port)\r\n    .withDatabase(DATABASE)\r\n    .withCollection(COLLECTION)\r\n    .withQueryBuilder(\r\n        FindQueryBuilder.create()\r\n            .withFilters(Filters.eq(\"scientist\", \"Einstein\"))\r\n            .withLimit(5)));\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using aggregations\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList<BsonDocument> aggregates = new ArrayList<BsonDocument>();\r\n    aggregates.add(\r\n        new BsonDocument(\r\n            \"$match\",\r\n            new BsonDocument(\"country\", new BsonDocument(\"$eq\", new BsonString(\"England\")))));\r\n\r\nMongoDbIO.read()\r\n    .withUri(\"mongodb://localhost:\" + port)\r\n    .withDatabase(DATABASE)\r\n    .withCollection(COLLECTION)\r\n    .withQueryBuilder(\r\n        AggregationQueryBuilder.create().withMongoDbPipeline(aggregates)));\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Upgrade Guide\r\n\r\nThis release will result in some `Read` stages to fail. The following examples show how to refactor existing code to the new API.\r\n\r\n### Reading with a filter\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n```java\r\nMongoDbIO.read()\r\n    .withUri(\"mongodb://localhost:\" + port)\r\n    .withDatabase(DATABASE)\r\n    .withCollection(COLLECTION)\r\n    .withFilter(\"{\\\"scientist\\\":\\\"Einstein\\\"}\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n```java\r\nMongoDbIO.read()\r\n    .withUri(\"mongodb://localhost:\" + port)\r\n    .withDatabase(DATABASE)\r\n    .withCollection(COLLECTION)\r\n    .withQueryBuilder(\r\n      FindQueryBuilder.create()\r\n        .withFilters(Filters.eq(\"scientist\", \"Einstein\"))));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reading with a filter and projections\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n```java\r\nMongoDbIO.read()\r\n    .withUri(\"mongodb://localhost:\" + port)\r\n    .withDatabase(DATABASE)\r\n    .withCollection(COLLECTION)\r\n    .withFilter(\"{\\\"scientist\\\":\\\"Einstein\\\"}\")\r\n    .withProjection(\"country\", \"scientist\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n```java\r\nMongoDbIO.read()\r\n    .withUri(\"mongodb://localhost:\" + port)\r\n    .withDatabase(DATABASE)\r\n    .withCollection(COLLECTION)\r\n    .withQueryBuilder(\r\n        FindQueryBuilder.create()\r\n            .withFilters(Filters.eq(\"scientist\", \"Einstein\"))\r\n            .withProjection(Arrays.asList(new String[] {\"country\", \"scientist\"}))));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reading with Projection\r\n\r\nBefore\r\n```java\r\nMongoDbIO.read()\r\n    .withUri(\"mongodb://localhost:\" + port)\r\n    .withDatabase(DATABASE)\r\n    .withCollection(COLLECTION)\r\n    .withProjection(\"country\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n```java\r\nMongoDbIO.read()\r\n    .withUri(\"mongodb://localhost:\" + port)\r\n    .withDatabase(DATABASE)\r\n    .withCollection(COLLECTION)\r\n    .withQueryBuilder(\r\n        FindQueryBuilder.create()\r\n            .withProjection(Arrays.asList(new String[] {\"country\"}))));\r\n```\r\n\r\nPost-Commit

the goal to merge read and write parts of Hadoop Input/Output Format files, we need to move `HadoopInputFormatIO.Read` into `HadoopFormatIO` and deprecate it.\r\n\r\nThe following things were done in this PR:\r\n- `HadoopInputFormatIO.Read` implementation moved into `HadoopFormatIO`\r\n- `HadoopInputFormatIO` is left only as a public interface, all calls are proxied to `HadoopFormatIO`\r\n- `HadoopInputFormatIO` is deprecated\r\n- Tests from `hadoop-input-format` package are copied to `hadoop-input-format` and adapted accordingly\r\n- Old tests of `hadoop-input-format` are left in place to test old deprecated functionality. \r\n\r\nMost changes are only copying and small refactoring, no new functionality was added.\r\n\r\nR: @dmvk R: @timrobertson100 - please, take a

PR is a follow-up on #7029, which was reverted in #7107 due to a checksum mismatch in the postcommit tests.\r\n\r\nI tested the PostCommit in #7239. Relevant output of test:\r\n> 15:19:54 root: INFO: CHECKING HASHES\r\n15:19:54 root: ERROR: NEW HASH: d860e636050c559a16a791aff40d6ad809d4daf0\r\n15:19:54 root: ERROR: OLD HASH: 83789a7c1bca7959dcf23d3bc37e9204e594330f\r\n15:19:54 root: ERROR: CONTENT:\r\n15:19:54 root: ERROR: [(1, 16), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (7, 8), (8, 4), (9, 7), (10, 10), (11, 9), (12, 10)]\r\n\r\nThe mismatch is a result of moving the sorting after the string casting in the hashing function. This leads to different sorting behavior for numbers. When looking at the sorted content in the old and new hashing function, we get:\r\nOld: [(1, 16), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (7, 8), (8, 4), (9, 7), (10, 10), (11, 9), (12, 10)]\r\nNew: ['(1, 16)', '(10, 10)', '(11, 9)', '(12, 10)', '(2, 7)', '(3, 6)', '(4, 5)', '(5, 6)', '(6, 5)', '(7, 8)', '(8, 4)', '(9, 7)']\r\n\r\nWhen moving the sort call in front of the string casting in the new hashing function, we get the same checksum as the old hashing function. However, this will fail on Python 3 due to `TypeError: unorderable types` when comparing different types.\r\n\r\nI have therefore updated the postcommit checksum to reflect the hash function change.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow |

is a PR that adds the documentations for the Nemo Runner on the Beam website, as well as an appropriate profile to the maven artifact `pom.xml` file. At the moment, the Apache Nemo 0.1 release process is in progress, and I'm expecting the release process to be finished by this or next week hopefully. The maven `pom.xml` will be perfectly valid by then. As for now, in order to test the Nemo Runner, it has to be built on the local machine from source (get source from https://github.com/apache/incubator-nemo and run the command `man clean install -DskipTests`) and the version can be specified as `0.1-SNAPSHOT`. I've confirmed that the commands that I've entered in the documents work fine on my machine (Mac OS). I've mostly followed the format of other runners to provide the documentation for Apache Nemo Runner, but please let me know if there are additional changes that has to be made.

Each version lives in a\r\nseparate project folder and loads the main 'flink_runner.gradle' script. Each\r\nproject can configure a custom Flink version and a custom source folder\r\nlocation. This will allow to do overrides in the future when the source can not\r\nbe made compatible across different Flink versions.\r\n\r\n## [BEAM-5267] Make source 1.6 compatible\r\n\r\n## [BEAM-5267] Add

ProcessRemoteBundleOperation, the received element from sdk harness will be passed into all following OutputReceivers, which is a wrong assumption. Ideally, received element should be passed into the OutputReceiver that represents the same PCollection, There are 2 major changes to make this happen:\r\n1. When converting an InstructionOutput into an InstructionOutputNode, generate a pcollection id and attach to that node.\r\n2. Construct a pcollectionId -> OutputReceiver map and pass it into ProcessRemoteBundleOperation.
