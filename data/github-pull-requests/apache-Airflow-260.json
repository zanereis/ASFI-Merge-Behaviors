Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-14T18:41:14Z","updated_at":"2019-08-28T19:12:30Z","closed_at":"2019-08-28T19:12:30Z","merged_at":"2019-08-28T19:12:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd544eb0cbffff77a833ab185049db6c115e822d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-14T17:24:03Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T18:34:39Z","closed_at":"2019-08-14T18:34:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1be8c38539b07687dd2e1a070d813d07895a9985","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/102c80043517704e88027eb895b70052136f37b2","head":{"label":"idralyuk:AIRFLOW-5118","ref":"AIRFLOW-5118","sha":"102c80043517704e88027eb895b70052136f37b2","user":{"login":"idralyuk","id":989850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTg1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/989850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk","html_url":"https://github.com/idralyuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":201048898,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDEwNDg4OTg=","name":"airflow","full_name":"idralyuk/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"idralyuk","id":989850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4OTg1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/989850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk","html_url":"https://github.com/idralyuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idralyuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/idralyuk/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5147\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR fixes the previous solution (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4589) of providing k8s annotations to workers created by k8s executor. Previously each annotation key had to be declared as part of the airflow config key which implied having some limitations on it (like it could not contatin `/` character). \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n ```\r\nexecutors.TestKubeConfig.test_kube_config_worker_annotations_properly_parsed\r\nexecutors.TestKubeConfig.test_kube_config_no_worker_annotations\r\n```\r\nand updates\r\n```\r\nkubernetes.TestKubernetesWorkerConfiguration.test_make_pod_with_empty_executor_config\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-14T16:05:23Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T16:49:01Z","closed_at":"2019-09-18T16:49:01Z","merged_at":"2019-09-18T16:49:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"deec7548c2a57c7b48a4c3338ba84af536c88d8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5819/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5819/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5819/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4c5807726d6902ddc3c37eadadfeff09e4395a27","head":{"label":"andrei-l:master","ref":"master","sha":"4c5807726d6902ddc3c37eadadfeff09e4395a27","user":{"login":"andrei-l","id":5362531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI1MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5362531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l","html_url":"https://github.com/andrei-l","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":202382811,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDIzODI4MTE=","name":"airflow","full_name":"andrei-l/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrei-l","id":5362531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI1MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5362531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l","html_url":"https://github.com/andrei-l","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrei-l/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrei-l/airflow","description":"Apache

master introduced a __init__.py file in\r\nthe project root folder, which basically breaks all imports in local\r\ndevelopment (`pip install -e .`) as it turns the project root into a\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

The discussion begins in PR: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5763\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe previous PR #5763 has been merged and reverted, so I create PR again with the same change to discuss it. Any comment on PR #5763 sends an email to all the committers across all Apache projects, so please do not comment. @kaxil have locked down the conversation but that would still allow anyone with write access to the repo to be able to comment on it.\r\n\r\nNote from @kaxil:\r\n> Asked by @aijamalnk \r\n> \r\n> Note from her:\r\n> \r\n> > I've looked at Google Analytics for the Airflow site, and I noticed that:\r\n> > -The https://airflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ site has the GA code set up.\r\n> > - The https://airflow.apache.org site does NOT have the GA code set up.\r\n> > So the data that we're getting on GA is not complete. \r\n> > It would be really helpful to fix it soon, before we start revamping the website to understand the changes user behavior (I am signing a contract with a vendor next week)\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-14T07:19:07Z","updated_at":"2019-08-27T20:13:14Z","closed_at":"2019-08-27T20:13:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2af577b2375d229ad1b91b59394426162e83937d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5817/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5817/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5817/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/00ee1f6046558964013ffa99722ca87d04b4bd82","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:airflow-5148","ref":"airflow-5148","sha":"00ee1f6046558964013ffa99722ca87d04b4bd82","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4526) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4526\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- I delved through the airflow/k8s python code, and it looks as if we can alleviate the above referenced JIRA issue by adding the ability for users to supply a timeout for the connection to the logs of the image running in the KubernetesPodOperator. From what I can glean of the codebase, the `pod_launcher` calls [`read_namespaced_pod_log`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/5899cec01e0ea69a54e650a9e1abdbcd5370e120/airflow/kubernetes/pod_launcher.py#L149), which then calls the k8s API via a `GET` request to `/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name}/log`. This `GET` request is fulfilled by the API client through a [`request`](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/master/kubernetes/client/api_client.py#L354). Every request has the option to provide several options, one of which is `_preload_content`, which is used in Airflow currently another of which is `_request_timeout`, which this PR uses. This `_request_timeout` is fulfilled by the `RESTClientObject` which is implemented [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/master/kubernetes/client/rest.py#L57). Within the REST client, the `_request_timeout` is taken care of [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/master/kubernetes/client/rest.py#L142) by `urllib3` using a [`Timeout`](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide.html#using-timeouts). \r\n\r\n- A `urllib3` Timeout allows you to \"to control how long (in seconds) requests are allowed to run before being aborted.\" This means that when logs are not received within 10 minutes, this call will properly be aborted and the retry logic recently implemented in [PR-5284](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5284) will then kick in. After three retries, as far as I can tell, the pod operator task would then be marked as a failure.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: this is an extremely hard to reproduce failure case...we have been unable to reproduce it in a reliable manner during testing, but it does occur on long running tasks (> 1hr). Any task that runs for a long period of time and has connection issues is not easy to test. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5172\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the attribute `schedule_interval_edge`, a string containing either 'start' or 'end', to DAGs. The scheduler uses the value to determining if a DAG should be scheduled at the start or the end of the schedule interval.\r\n\r\nA parameter with the same name was also added to the default_airflow.cfg in the [scheduler] section. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\ntests.jobs.test_scheduler_job:SchedulerJobTest.test_schedule_interval_edge\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-12T15:36:46Z","updated_at":"2021-05-20T15:02:50Z","closed_at":"2021-05-20T15:02:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe5d5b490705650ff3dea3de5c9deeeb08417929","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1536638852,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2NjM4ODUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/pinned","name":"pinned","color":"f2b798","default":false,"description":"Protect

is the first set of new static checks to add (for python files)\r\n\r\nAs described in another PR - I split it per file type. There will be about 7 or 8 such changes.\r\n\r\nThis one is by far the biggest because it is for python files:\r\n\r\n* It makes licence files consistent accross all python files (there were subtle differences, mistakes partially copied licenses etc). Now we have single LICENSE.txt file from which we automatically add licence to python file if it is missing. The same LICENSE.txt file will be used for other file types.\r\n* It adds coding pragma for all files if they are missing\r\n* It checks if there are no debug statements left in python code\r\n* It fixes pylint errors in all the files touched by either LICENSE.txt change or pragma - this is actually what causes so many changes (but only in files that were changed because one of the two other changes: pragma/license)\r\n\r\nWe also have a script that can refresh pylint_todo.txt (used in this case)\r\n\r\nThere are quite a number of pylint fixes but they were all planned anyway.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5170\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5169\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf Project_id is not passed to the StorageClient it tries to infer the Project_ID from the environment variables or Cloud SDK.\r\n\r\nIf neither env variables is set nor Cloud SDK is configured it will error with the following message:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngoogle.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError: Could not automatically determine credentials. Please set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS or explicitly create credentials and re-run the application. For more information, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI need some help on adding a test to check that project_id exists when storage client is created @mik-laj \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5163\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBy default `BaseOperator.do_xcom_push` is set to `True`, pushing any return value of execute() to an XCom by default. This is most of the time not desirable and must be explicitly turned off. It makes more sense to set it to `False` by default.\r\n\r\nIn my memory there was a sentence about this behaviour in the docs but I cannot find it. If anybody knows, let me know.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-11T18:36:56Z","updated_at":"2019-12-14T12:02:01Z","closed_at":"2019-12-14T12:02:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"963256dea1dd95055d2cbc62b9a65c27e7b9ed15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2923\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1784 \r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nLatestOnlyOperator is a special case of a BranchOperator, thus it should inherit from it.\r\nThis fixes an issue where the skipping behaviour of LatestOnlyOperator is inconsistent with other operators by forcefully skipping all downstream tasks recursively, ignoring trigger rules.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nExtended `tests.operators.test_latest_only_operator.py` to cover downstream children with trigger rules. Furthermore fixed the test to not skip task in externally triggered DagRuns.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-10T22:35:56Z","updated_at":"2019-08-31T11:41:14Z","closed_at":"2019-08-31T11:41:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a16b4ca1adbd4c2e3dca529e29aeda24f85cbcc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5778/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/5778/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/5778/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/10a86adab77b546136f514d159674ee1e6ed196b","head":{"label":"m1racoli:feature/AIRFLOW-2923","ref":"feature/AIRFLOW-2923","sha":"10a86adab77b546136f514d159674ee1e6ed196b","user":{"login":"m1racoli","id":7921017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjEwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7921017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli","html_url":"https://github.com/m1racoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115028004,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTUwMjgwMDQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"m1racoli/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"m1racoli","id":7921017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjEwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7921017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli","html_url":"https://github.com/m1racoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m1racoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/m1racoli/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5145\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nDon't display the *Is Encrypted* checkbox in the Variable add UI; the user's decision (explicit or implicit) here can incorrectly override the correct setting of this value when the model is saved.\r\n\r\nIn other words, this attempts to prevent this scenario from occurring\r\nwhen the airflow instance has a fernet key set up and user forgets or decides not to check **Is Encrypted**:\r\n\r\n* Database value is ciphertext, while is_encrypted is false.\r\n* Variable.get does not attempt to decrypt the ciphertext and therefore does not return the correct value.\r\n* Instead, the ciphertext, which looks like `gAAAAABdS1d_Mw<SNIP>D-O9SIg==`, is treated as the actual value ... so json deserialization and any other intended usage of the value fails.\r\n\r\n**UI Changes**:\r\n\r\nIs Encrypted checkbox is removed from the variable create screen.\r\n\r\nCurrent `/variable/add` in my local 1.10.3 instance:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"369\" alt=\"current-with-is-enc-cb\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/617540/62714062-71c4e080-b9c3-11e9-8562-84c20742c10a.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter change in that instance:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"331\" alt=\"no-is-encrypted-cb\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/617540/62714074-7b4e4880-b9c3-11e9-9319-deeabf640ede.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n* No tests added yet as this is a minor config change ... but I'm new to this to so willing to stand corrected :)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5139\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhile attempting to create a self-signed TLS connection between airflow\r\nand ES, we discovered that airflow does now allow users to modify the\r\nSSL state of the elasticsearchtaskhandler. This commit will allow users\r\nto define ES settings in the airflow.cfg\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

scheduler calls `list_py_file_paths` to find DAGs to schedule. It does so\r\nwithout passing any parameters other than the directory. This means that\r\nit *won't* discover DAGs that are missing the words \"airflow\" and \"DAG\" even\r\nif DAG_DISCOVERY_SAFE_MODE is disabled.\r\n\r\nSince `list_py_file_paths` will refer to the configuration if\r\n`include_examples` is not provided, it makes sense to have the same behaviour\r\nfor `safe_mode`.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSee above. There are no UI changes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nI stared at the code a long time and couldn't figure out a good place to test.\r\n\r\n- `list_py_file_paths` doesn't have direct tests\r\n  - adding a test for this particular branch might be OK, but feels a bit like a [change detector test](https://testing.googleblog.com/2015/01/testing-on-toilet-change-detector-tests.html)\r\n  - If you can point me to a context manager to temporarily override a configuration setting, I could probably write some direct tests that use `tests/dags/` as the source of DAGs\r\n- `SchedulerJob` is actually exhibiting the bug, and is where the behaviour needs to be correct\r\n  - There's no obvious API to exercise that would let me test this\r\n  - I could theoretically extract a `_make_processor_agent` from `_execute`, and assert things about its return value, but I don't want spend time on that without a core contributor approving it first\r\n  - I would still need a context manager to temporarily override configuration settings \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code

Jira\r\n\r\nPartly addresses https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5138 by allowing users to silence the spurious warnings.\r\n\r\nIt's very uncommon for Python libraries to override warning settings in this way. By doing so, tools like pytest filterwarnings or even `python -W` won't suppress the warnings, which means the warnings just become background noise, rather than a meaningful message from one person to another.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nMy PR doesn't need automated tests because it's reverting warnings behaviour to the Python default, which is fine for practically everyone else.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nNone required. No behaviour changes.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8` — your CI doesn't catch

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4568\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\nAlso possibly dupe of [AIRFLOW-104]??\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nOften times we want an ExternalTaskSensor to not behave as a sensor (poke until a condition is satisfied), and instead as a mirror of a task in another dag (succeed if the external succeeds, fail if the external fails).\r\n\r\nThis change adds the `unallowed_states` parameter to the ExternalTaskSensor. If external task/dag is found to be in `unallowed_states`, the sensor will immediately fail instead of previous behavior of returning false and continuing to poke until timeout.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdditional tests in tests/sensors/test_external_task_sensor.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-08T04:15:42Z","updated_at":"2020-06-16T14:21:48Z","closed_at":"2020-01-10T20:31:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50ed0719d4f7f4aaaf3c41928347cbc13d42c8db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

addresses the following [Airflow Jira 5088](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5088) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - [AIP-24](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-24+DAG+Persistence+in+DB+using+JSON+for+Airflow+Webserver+and+%28optional%29+Scheduler)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n - Based on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5701, this PR implements functionalities including writing serialized DAGs to DB in scheduler, reading DAGs from DB in webserver, controlled by [core] dagcached\r\n - The goal is to decouple webserver from the DAG folder, instead it reads everything from database.\r\n - Rendering template by functions is an exception, in that case it needs to re-import DAG, because functions are stringified in serialized DAG.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n - Added unit tests for airflow/models/serialized_dag.py\r\n - Tested basic UI functionanilties end-to-end\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5117) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5117\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR patches upstream k8s client to check for EKS api token refresh. Without this, Airflow K8S integration won't work if not deployed in cluster.\r\n\r\nWhen Airflow scheduler or worker is not deployed in K8S cluster, all K8S API call will fail with 401 error after running for about 14min.\r\n\r\nThis is due to EKS enforces a 15min timeout for all API tokens but the official k8S python client doesn't support token refresh.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nsee: tests/kubernetes/test_client.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5114\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`GCPTransferServiceHook.wait_for_transfer_job` defeaults its `timeout`\r\nparameter to 60 and assumes it is an integer or at least comparable to\r\none. This is a problem as some of the built-in operators that use it\r\nlike `S3ToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` and\r\n`GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` default their\r\n`timeout` param to `None`, and when they call this method with their\r\ndefault value, it causes an error. Fix this by allowing\r\n`wait_for_transfer_job` to accept a timeout of `None` and fill in\r\nappropriate defaults. This also adds functionality to allow it to take\r\na `timedelta` instead of an integer, allows seconds to be any real, as\r\nthere is really no need for them to actually be an integer, and fixes\r\nthe counting of time for determining timeout to be a bit more accurate.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nFrom the point of view of `GCPTransferServiceHook`, this is a purely internal change that doesn't affect any default behavior except allowing a parameter to be `None`. Since `None` is now the default, that particular case is already covered by the existing unit tests. In principle this could be tested from `S3ToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` or `GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator`, but that would require giving them an actual `GCPTransferServiceHook` instead of a Mock. I have tested this by running it on a Cloud Composer cluster and using it to transfer files from S3 to GCS using `S3ToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator`. I have not tested `GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` in a similar way, so maybe someone should do that as I don't think anyone ever actually tested it before releasing it. This combined with #5726 allows `S3ToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` to actually run correctly with default arguments for scheduling and timeout.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ X ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\nI have updated the docstrings of `GCPTransferServiceHook`, `S3ToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` and\r\n`GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` to document their previously undocumented default behaviors and to reflect the relaxed type requirements.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-05T20:15:05Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T07:58:33Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T07:58:33Z","merged_at":"2019-08-13T07:58:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"e71fe2c844db9f776ad235b72c43da0d1cf75882","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5104\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe GCS Transfer Service REST API requires that a schedule be set, even for\r\none-time immediate runs. This adds code to\r\n`S3ToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` and\r\n`GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` to set a default\r\none-time immediate run schedule when no `schedule` argument is passed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThis should just be fixing existing behavior, and is hard to test as it only produces an error when actually sent to the GCP API. I have tested it by running it on a Cloud Composer cluster and using it to transfer files from S3 to GCS using `S3ToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator`. I have not tested `GoogleCloudStorageToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` in a similar way, so maybe someone should do that as I don't think anyone ever actually tested it before releasing it. This combined with #5727 allows `S3ToGoogleCloudStorageTransferOperator` to run correctly with default arguments for scheduling and timeout.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ X ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-08-05T19:39:57Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T02:05:29Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T02:05:28Z","merged_at":"2019-08-13T02:05:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"1cf8bc4ae2f029a77f41aedb93432b2ba5666f85","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4192\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/5010 ending up in an endless discussion, I split up the PR to decide about individual task context variables. This PR removes `end_date` and `latest_date`.\r\n\r\nThey were added in the early days of Airflow (https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/45d14c15d89bdcec26a5b3c6bdb6e92ac71684ae) and in the mailing list discussion @artwr was the only one to comment on it:\r\n\r\n> \"both were a blend of things which were used by a backfill framework used internally at Airbnb. Latest date was used if you needed to join to a dimension for which you only wanted the latest version of the attributes in you backfill. end_date was used for time ranges where several days were processed together in a range to save on compute. I don't see an issue with removing them.\"\r\n\r\nI think we can safely remove these variables without any issues.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nBoth context variables are untested, so no tests were changed.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.
